_See_ Article 4 for the procedures to be followed. _

See also_ Article 75(c).

## Rule 108. Rules of court

The Judge Advocate General concerned and persons designated by the

 Judge Advocate General may make rules of court not inconsistent with these

 rules for the conduct of court-martial proceedings. Such rules shall be

disseminated in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Judge Advocate

 General concerned or a person to whom this authority has been delegated.

 Noncompliance with such procedures shall not affect the validity of any rule

of court with respect to a party who has received actual and timely notice

of the rule or who has not been prejudiced under Article 59 by the absence

of such notice. Copies of all rules of court issued under this rule shall

be forwarded to the Judge Advocate General concerned.

## Rule 109. Professional supervision of military judges and counsel

### (a) In general.

Each Judge Advocate General is responsible for the professional

supervision and discipline of military trial and appellate military judges,

judge advocates, and other lawyers who practice in proceedings governed by

the code and this Manual. To discharge this responsibility each Judge Advocate

General may prescribe rules of professional conduct not inconsistent with

this rule or this Manual. Rules of professional conduct promulgated pursuant

to this rule may include sanctions for violations of such rules. Sanctions

may include but are not limited to indefinite suspension from practice in

courts-martial and in the Courts of Criminal Appeals. Such suspensions may

only be imposed by the Judge Advocate General of the armed service of such

courts. Prior to imposing any discipline under this rule, the subject of the

proposed action must be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard. The

Judge Advocate General concerned may upon good cause shown modify or revoke

suspension. Procedures to investigate complaints against military trial judges

 and appellate military judges are contained in subsection (c) of this rule.

### (b) Action after suspension or disbarment.

When a Judge Advocate General suspends a person from practice or

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces disbars a person, any Judge Advocate

 General may suspend that person from practice upon written notice and opportunity

to be heard in writing.

### (c) Investigation of judges.

#### (1) In general.

These rules and procedures promulgated pursuant to Article 6a are

 established to investigate and dispose of charges, allegations, or information

 pertaining to the fitness of a military trial judge or appellate military

judge to perform the duties of the judge's office.

#### (2) Policy.

Allegations of judicial misconduct or unfitness shall be investigated

pursuant to the procedures of this rule and appropriate action shall be taken.

Judicial misconduct includes any act or omission that may serve to demonstrate

unfitness for further duty as a judge, including, but not limited to violations

of applicable ethical standards.

##### Discussion

The term "unfitness" should be construed broadly, including,

for example, matters relating to the incompetence, impartiality, and misconduct

of the judge. Erroneous decisions of a judge are not subject to investigation

under this rule. Challenges to these decisions are more appropriately left

to the appellate process.

#### (3) Complaints.

Complaints concerning a military trial judge or appellate military

 judge will be forwarded to the Judge Advocate General of the service concerned

 or to a person designated by the Judge Advocate General concerned to receive

such complaints.

##### Discussion

Complaints need not be made in any specific form, but if possible

 complaints should be made under oath. Complaints may be made by judges,

lawyers, a party, court personnel, members of the general public or members

of the military community. Reports in the news media relating to the conduct

of a judge may also form the basis of a complaint.

  An individual

designated to receive complaints under this subsection should have judicial

experience. The chief trial judge of a service may be designated to receive

complaints against military trial judges.

#### (4) Initial action upon receipt of a complaint.

Upon receipt, a complaint will be screened by the Judge Advocate

 General concerned or by the individual designated in subsection (c)(3) of

this rule to receive complaints. An initial inquiry is necessary if the

complaint, taken as true, would constitute judicial misconduct or unfitness

for further service as a judge. Prior to the commencement of an initial inquiry,

the Judge Advocate General concerned shall be notified that a complaint has

been filed and that an initial inquiry will be conducted. The Judge Advocate

General concerned may temporarily suspend the subject of a complaint from

performing judicial duties pending the outcome of any inquiry or investigation

conducted pursuant to this rule. Such inquiries or investigations shall be

conducted with reasonable promptness.

##### Discussion

Complaints under this subsection will be treated with confidentiality.

Confidentiality protects the subject judge and the judiciary when a complaint

is not substantiated. Confidentiality also encourages the reporting of allegations

of judicial misconduct or unfitness and permits complaints to be screened

with the full cooperation of others.

 Complaints containing allegations

of criminality should be referred to the appropriate criminal investigative

agency in accordance with Appendix 3 of this Manual.

#### (5) Initial inquiry.

##### (A) In general.

An initial inquiry is necessary to determine if the complaint is

 substantiated. A complaint is substantiated upon finding that it is more

likely than not that the subject judge has engaged in judicial misconduct

or is otherwise unfit for further service as a judge.

##### (B) Responsibility to conduct initial inquiry.

The Judge Advocate General concerned, or the person designated to

 receive complaints under subsection (c)(3) of this rule will conduct or order

 an initial inquiry. The individual designated to conduct the inquiry should,

if practicable, be senior to the subject of the complaint. If the subject

of the complaint is a military trial judge, the individual designated to

conduct the initial inquiry should, if practicable, be a military trial judge

or an individual with experience as a military trial judge. If the subject

of the complaint is an appellate military judge, the individual designated

to conduct the inquiry should, if practicable, have experience as an appellate

military judge.

###### Discussion

To avoid the type of conflict prohibited in Article 66(g), the Judge

 Advocate General's designee should not ordinarily be a member of the same

Court of Criminal Appeals as the subject of the complaint. If practicable,

a former appellate military judge should be designated.

##### (C) Due process.

During the initial inquiry, the subject of the complaint will, at

a minimum, be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

##### (D) Action following the initial inquiry.

If the complaint is not substantiated pursuant to subsection (c)(5)(A)

of this rule, the complaint shall be dismissed as unfounded. If the complaint

is substantiated, minor professional disciplinary action may be taken or

the complaint may be forwarded, with findings and recommendations, to the

Judge Advocate General concerned. Minor professional disciplinary action is

defined as counseling or the issuance of an oral or written admonition or

reprimand. The Judge Advocate General concerned will be notified prior to

taking minor professional disciplinary action or dismissing a complaint as

 unfounded.

#### (6) Action by the Judge Advocate General.

##### (A) In general.

The Judge Advocates General are responsible for the professional

 supervision and discipline of military trial and appellate military judges

under their jurisdiction. Upon receipt of findings and recommendations required

by subsection (c)(5) of this rule the Judge Advocate General concerned will

take appropriate action.

##### (B) Appropriate actions.

The Judge Advocate General concerned may dismiss the complaint,

order an additional inquiry, appoint an ethics commission to consider the

complaint, refer the matter to another appropriate investigative agency or

take appropriate professional disciplinary action pursuant to the rules of

 professional conduct prescribed by the Judge Advocate General under subsection

 (a) of this rule. Any decision of the Judge Advocate General, under this

rule, is final and is not subject to appeal.

###### Discussion

The discretionary reassignment of military trial judges or appellate

 military judges to meet the needs of the service is not professional disciplinary

action.

##### (C) Standard of proof.

Prior to taking professional disciplinary action, other than minor

disciplinary action as defined in subsection (c)(5) of this rule, the Judge

Advocate General concerned shall find, in writing, that the subject of the

complaint engaged in judicial misconduct or is otherwise unfit for continued

service as a military judge, and that such misconduct or unfitness is established

by clear and convincing evidence.

##### (D) Due process.

Prior to taking final action on the complaint, the Judge Advocate

 General concerned will ensure that the subject of the complaint is, at a

 minimum, given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

#### (7) The Ethics Commission.

##### (A) Membership.

If appointed pursuant to subsection (c)(6)(B) of this rule, an ethics

 commission shall consist of at least three members. If the subject

of the complaint is a military trial judge, the commission should include

one or more military trial judges or individuals with experience as a military

trial judge. If the subject of the complaint is an appellate military judge,

the commission should include one or more individuals with experience as

an appellate military judge. Members of the commission should, if practicable,

 be senior to the subject of the complaint.

##### (B) Duties.

The commission will perform those duties assigned by the Judge

Advocate General concerned. Normally, the commission will provide an opinion

as to whether the subject's acts or omissions constitute judicial misconduct

or unfitness. If the commission determines that the affected judge engaged

in judicial misconduct or is unfit for continued judicial service, the commission

may be required to recommend an appropriate disposition to The Judge Advocate

General concerned.

###### Discussion

The Judge Advocate General concerned may appoint an ad hoc or a

standing commission.

#### (8) Rules of procedure.

The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the service concerned

 may establish additional procedures consistent with this rule and Article

 6a.

# CHAPTER II. JURISDICTION

## Rule 201. Jurisdiction in general

### (a) Nature of courts-martial jurisdiction.

(1) The jurisdiction of courts-martial is entirely penal or disciplinary.

##### Discussion

"Jurisdiction" means the power to hear a case and to

 render a legally competent decision. A court-martial has no power to adjudge

 civil remedies. For example, a court-martial may not adjudge the payment

of damages, collect private debts, order the return of property, or order

a criminal forfeiture of seized property. A summary court-martial appointed

under 10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 4712 or 9712 to dispose of the effects of a

deceased person is not affected by these Rules or this Manual.

(2) The code applies in all places.

##### Discussion

 Except insofar as required by the Constitution, the Code, or the Manual, such as persons listed under Article 2(a)(10), jurisdiction of courts-martial does not depend on where the offense was committed.

(3) The jurisdiction of a court-martial with respect to offenses under

the code is not affected by the place where the court-martial sits. The jurisdiction

of a court-martial with respect to military government or the law of war

is not affected by the place where the court-martial sits except as otherwise

expressly required by this Manual or applicable rule of international law.

##### Discussion

In addition to the power to try persons for offenses under the code,

 general courts-martial have power to try certain persons for violations of

the law of war and for crimes or offenses against the law of the territory

occupied as an incident of war or belligerency whenever the local civil authority

is superseded in whole or part by the military authority of the occupying

power. _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(B). In cases where a person

is tried by general court-martial for offenses against the law of an occupied

territory, the court-martial normally sits in the country where the offense

is committed, and must do so under certain circumstances. _See_ Articles

4, 64, and 66, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons

in Time of War, August 12, 1949, arts. 4, 64, and 66, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 3559-60

 T.I.A.S. No. 3365.

### (b) Requisites of court-martial jurisdiction.

A court-martial always has jurisdiction to determine whether it

has jurisdiction. Otherwise for a court-martial to have jurisdiction:

(1) The court-martial must be convened by an official empowered to convene

it;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 504; 1302.

(2) The court-martial must be composed in accordance with these rules

 with respect to number and qualifications of its personnel. As used here

 "personnel" includes only the military judge, the members, and

the summary court-martial;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 501-504; 1301.

(3) Each charge before the court-martial must be referred to it by

competent authority;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 601.

(4) The accused must be a person subject to court-martial jurisdiction;

 and

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 202.

(5) The offense must be subject to court-martial jurisdiction.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 203.

  The judgment

of a court-martial without jurisdiction is void and is entitled to no legal

effect. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)(iv). _But see_ R.C.M.

 810(d) concerning the effect of certain decisions by courts-martial without

jurisdiction.

### (c) Contempt.

A judge detailed to a court-martial may punish for contempt any person who uses any menacing word, sign, or gesture in the presence of the judge during the proceedings of the court-martial; disturbs the proceedings of the court-martial by any riot or disorder; or willfully disobeys the lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the court-martial. The punishment may not exceed confinement for 30 days or a fine of $1,000, or both.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 809 for procedures and standards for

contempt proceedings.

### (d) Exclusive and nonexclusive jurisdiction.

(1) Courts-martial have exclusive jurisdiction of purely military offenses.

(2) An act or omission which violates both the code and local criminal

law, foreign or domestic, may be tried by a court-martial, or by a proper

civilian tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, subject to R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)

and regulations of the Secretary concerned, by both.

(3) Where an act or omission is subject to trial by court-martial and

by one or more civil tribunals, foreign or domestic, the determination which

nation, state, or agency will exercise jurisdiction is a matter for the nations,

states, and agencies concerned, and is not a right of the suspect or accused.

##### Discussion

In the case of an act or omission which violates the code and a

 criminal law of a State, the United States, or both, the determination which

agency shall exercise jurisdiction should normally be made through consultation

or prior agreement between appropriate military officials (ordinarily the

staff judge advocate) and appropriate civilian authorities (United States

Attorney, or equivalent). _See also_ Memorandum of Understanding

Between Departments of Justice and Defense Relating to the Investigation

and Prosecution of Crimes Over Which the Two Departments Have Concurrent

Jurisdiction at Appendix 3.

  Under the Constitution, a person

may not be tried for the same misconduct by both a court-martial and another

federal court. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Although it is constitutionally

permissible to try a person by court-martial and by a State court for the

same act, as a matter of policy a person who is pending trial or has been

tried by a State court should not ordinarily be tried by court-martial for

the same act. Overseas, international agreements might preclude trial by

one state of a person acquitted or finally convicted of a given act by the

other state.

  Under international law, a friendly foreign

nation has jurisdiction to punish offenses committed within its borders by

members of a visiting force, unless expressly or impliedly consents to relinquish

its jurisdiction to the visiting sovereign. The procedures and standards

for determining which nation will exercise jurisdiction are normally established

by treaty. _See_, for example, NATO Status of Forces Agreement,

June 19, 1951, 4 U.S.T. 1792, T.I.A.S. No. 2846. As a matter of policy, efforts

should be made to maximize the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over

persons subject to the code to the extent possible under applicable agreements.

 _

See_ R.C.M. 106 concerning delivery of offenders to civilian authorities.

 _

See_ also R.C.M. 201(g) concerning the jurisdiction of other military

tribunals.

### (e) Reciprocal jurisdiction.

(1) Each armed force has court-martial jurisdiction over all persons

subject to the code.

(2)(A) A commander of a unified or specified combatant command may convene

 courts-martial over members of any of the armed forces.

(B) So much of the authority vested in the President under Article

22(a)(9) to empower any commanding officer of a joint command or joint task

 force to convene courts-martial is delegated to the Secretary of Defense,

and such a commanding officer may convene general courts-martial for the

trial of members of any of the armed forces assigned or attached to a combatant command or joint command.

(C) A commander who is empowered to convene a court-martial under subsections

(e)(2)(A) or (e)(2)(B) of this rule may expressly authorize a commanding

officer of a subordinate joint command or subordinate joint task force who

is authorized to convene special and summary courts-martial to convene such

courts-martial for the trial of members of other armed forces assigned or attached to a joint command or joint task force, under regulations

which the superior command may prescribe.

(3) A member of one armed force may be tried by a court-martial convened

 by a member of another armed force, using the implementing regulations and procedures prescribed by the Secretary concerned of the military service of the accused, when:

(A) The court-martial is convened by a commander authorized to convene

 courts-martial under subsection (e)(2) of this rule; or

(B) The accused cannot be delivered to the armed force of which the

 accused is a member without manifest injury to the armed forces.

An

accused should not ordinarily be tried by a court-martial convened by a member

of a different armed force except when the circumstances described in (A)

or (B) exist. However, failure to comply with this policy does not affect

an otherwise valid referral.

(4) Nothing in this rule prohibits detailing to a court-martial a military

judge, member, or counsel who is a member of an armed force different from that of the accused

or the convening authority, or both.

(5) In all cases, departmental review after that by the officer with

authority to convene a general court-martial for the command which held the

trial, where that review is required by the code, shall be carried out by

the department that includes the armed force of which the accused is a member.

(6) When there is a disagreement between the Secretaries of two military

 departments or between the Secretary of a military department and the commander

 of a unified or specified combatant command or other joint command or joint

 task force as to which organization should exercise jurisdiction over a particular

case or class of cases, the Secretary of Defense or an official acting under

the authority of the Secretary of Defense shall designate which organization

will exercise jurisdiction.

(7) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) or as otherwise directed

by the President or Secretary of Defense, whenever action under this Manual

is required or authorized to be taken by a person superior to-

(A) a commander of a unified or specified combatant command or;

(B) a commander of any other joint command or joint task force that

is not part of a unified or specified combatant command, the matter

shall be referred to the Secretary of the armed force of which the accused

is a member. The Secretary may convene a court-martial, take other appropriate

action, or, subject to R.C.M. 504(c), refer the matter to any person authorized

to convene a court-martial of the accused.

###### Discussion

As to the authority to convene courts-martial, see R.C.M. 504.

"Manifest injury" does not mean minor inconvenience

or expense. Examples of manifest injury include direct and substantial effect

on morale, discipline, or military operations, substantial expense or delay,

or loss of essential witnesses.

  As to the composition of

a court-martial for the trial of an accused who is a member of another armed

force, _see_ R.C.M. 503(a)(3) Discussion. Cases involving

two or more accused who are members of different armed forces should not

be referred to a court-martial for a common trial.

### (f) Types of courts-martial.

**[Note: R.C.M. 201(f)(1) and (f)(2) apply to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.]**

#### (1) General courts-martial.

##### (A) Cases under the code.

(i) Except as otherwise expressly provided, general courts-martial may

try any person subject to the code for any offense made punishable under

the code. General courts-martial also may try any person for a violation

of Article 83, 104, or 106.

(ii) Upon a finding of guilty of an offense made punishable by the code,

 general courts-martial may, within limits prescribed by this Manual, adjudge

 any punishment authorized under R.C.M. 1003.

(iii) Notwithstanding any other rule, the death penalty may not be adjudged

if:

(a) Not specifically authorized for the offense by the code and Part

IV of this Manual; or

(b) The case has not been referred with a special instruction that the

case is to be tried as capital.

##### (B) Cases under the law of war.

(i) General courts-martial may try any person who by the law of war

is subject to trial by military tribunal for any crime or offense against:

(a) The law of war; or

(b) The law of the territory occupied as an incident of war or belligerency

whenever the local civil authority is superseded in whole or part by the

military authority of the occupying power. The law of the occupied territory

 includes the local criminal law as adopted or modified by competent authority,

and the proclamations, ordinances, regulations, or orders promulgated by

competent authority of the occupying power.

######## Discussion

Subsection (f)(1)(B)(i)(b) is an exercise of the

power of military government.

(ii) When a general court-martial exercises jurisdiction under the law

of war, it may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war.

####### Discussion

Certain limitations on the discretion of military tribunals to adjudge

punishment under the law of war are prescribed in international conventions. _

See_, for example, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of

Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 68, 6 U.S.T. 3516, T.I.A.S.

No. 3365.

##### (C) Limitations in judge alone cases.

A general court-martial composed only of a military judge does not

have jurisdiction to try any person for any offense for which the death penalty

may be adjudged unless the case has been referred to trial as noncapital.

##### (D) Jurisdiction for Certain Sexual Offenses.

 Only a general court-martial has jurisdiction to try offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), and 120b(b), UCMJ, forcible sodomy under Article 125, UCMJ, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ.

#### (2) Special courts-martial.

##### (A) In general.

Except as otherwise expressly provided, special courts-martial may

try any person subject to the code for any noncapital offense made punishable

by the code and, as provided in this rule, for capital offenses.

##### (B) Punishments.

(i) Upon a finding of guilty, special courts-martial may adjudge, under

limitations prescribed by this Manual, any punishment authorized under R.C.M.

1003 except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal, confinement for more

than 1 year, hard labor without confinement for more than 3 months, forfeiture

of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture of pay for more

than 1 year.

(ii) A bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or

forfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged by a special

court-martial unless:

(a) Counsel qualified under Article 27(b) is detailed to represent the

 accused; and

(b) A military judge is detailed to the trial, except in a case in which

a military judge could not be detailed because of physical conditions or

military exigencies. Physical conditions or military exigencies, as the terms

are here used, may exist under rare circumstances, such as on an isolated

ship on the high seas or in a unit in an inaccessible area, provided compelling

reasons exist why trial must be held at that time and at that place. Mere

 inconvenience does not constitute a physical condition or military exigency

and does not excuse a failure to detail a military judge. If a military judge

cannot be detailed because of physical conditions or military exigencies,

a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture

of pay for more than six months, may be adjudged provided the other conditions

have been met. In that event, however, the convening authority shall, prior

to trial, make a written statement explaining why a military judge could

not be obtained. This statement shall be appended to the record of trial

and shall set forth in detail the reasons why a military judge could not be

detailed, and why the trial had to be held at that time and place.

######## Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 503 concerning detailing the military

judge and counsel.

  The requirement for counsel is satisfied

when counsel qualified under Article 27(b), and not otherwise disqualified,

has been detailed and made available, even though the accused may not choose

to cooperate with, or use the services of, such detailed counsel.

  The

physical condition or military exigency exception to the requirement for

a military judge does not apply to the requirement for detailing counsel qualified

under Article 27(b).

  _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(c)

concerning the requirements for a record of trial in special courts-martial.

##### (C) Capital offenses

(i) A capital offense for which there is prescribed a mandatory punishment

beyond the punitive power of a special court-martial shall not be referred

to such a court-martial.

(ii) An officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the

command which includes the accused may permit any capital offense other than

one described in subsection (f)(2)(C)(i) of this rule to be referred to a

special court-martial for trial.

(iii) The Secretary concerned may authorize, by regulation, officers exercising

special court-martial jurisdiction to refer capital offenses, other than

those described in subsection (f)(2)(C)(i) of this rule, to trial by special

court-martial without first obtaining the consent of the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the command.

###### (D) Certain Offenses under Articles 120, 120b, and 125.

Notwithstanding subsection (f)(2)(A), special courts-martial do not have jurisdiction over offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), and 120b(b), forcible sodomy under Article 125, UCMJ, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ. Such offenses shall not be referred to a special court-martial.

####### Discussion

 Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, only a general court-martial has jurisdiction over penetrative sex offenses under subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120, subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120b, Article 125, and attempts to commit such penetrative sex offenses under Article 80, UCMJ.

####### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 103(3) for a definition of capital offenses.

#### (3) Summary courts-martial.

_See_ R.C.M. 1301(c) and (d)(1).

### (g) Concurrent jurisdiction of other military tribunals.

The provisions of the code and this Manual conferring jurisdiction

 upon courts-martial do not deprive military commissions, provost courts,

or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders

or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military

commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.

#### Discussion

_See_ Articles 104 and 106 for some instances of

concurrent jurisdiction.

## Rule 202. Persons subject to the jurisdiction of courts-martial

### (a) In general.

Courts-martial may try any person when authorized to do so under

the code.

#### Discussion

##### (1) Authority under the code.

Article 2 lists classes of persons who are subject to the code.

These include active duty personnel (Article 2(a)(1)); cadets, aviation cadets,

and midshipmen (Article 2(a)(2)); certain retired personnel (Article 2(a)(4)

and (5)); members of Reserve components not on active duty under some circumstances

(Article 2(a)(3) and (6)); persons in the custody of the armed forces serving

a sentence imposed by court-martial (Article 2(a)(7)); and, under some circumstances,

specified categories of civilians (Article 2(a)(8), (9), (10), (11), and

(12); _see_ subsection (3) and (4) of this discussion). In

 addition, certain persons whose status as members of the armed forces or

as persons otherwise subject to the code apparently has ended may, nevertheless,

be amendable to trial by court-martial. _See_ Article 3, 4,

and 73. A person need not be subject to the code to be subject to trial by

court-martial under Articles 83, 104, or 106. _See also_ Article

48 and R.C.M. 809 concerning who may be subject to the contempt powers of

a court-martial.

##### (2) Active duty personnel.

Court-martial jurisdiction is most commonly exercised over active

 duty personnel. In general, a person becomes subject to court-martial jurisdiction

upon enlistment in or induction into the armed forces, acceptance of a commission,

or entry onto active duty pursuant to orders. Court-martial jurisdiction

over active duty personnel ordinarily ends on delivery of a discharge certificate

 or its equivalent to the person concerned issued pursuant to competent orders.

Orders transferring a person to the inactive reserve are the equivalent of

a discharge certificate for purposes of jurisdiction.

  These

are several important qualifications and exceptions to these general guidelines.

###### (A) Inception of court-martial jurisdiction over active duty personnel.

####### (i) Enlistment.

"The voluntary enlistment of any person who has the capacity

to understand the significance of enlisting in the armed forces shall be

valid for purposes of jurisdiction under [Article 2(a)]

and a change of status from civilian to member of the armed forces shall be

 effective upon taking the oath of enlistment." Article 2(b). A person

who is, at the time of enlistment, insane, intoxicated, or under the age

of 17 does not have the capacity to enlist by law. No court-martial jurisdiction

over such a person may exist as long as the incapacity continues. If the incapacity

ceases to exist, a "constructive enlistment" may result under

Article 2(c). _See_ discussion of "constructive enlistment"

below. Similarly, if the enlistment was involuntary, court-martial jurisdiction

will exist only when the coercion is removed and a "constructive enlistment"

under Article 2(c) is established.

  Persons age 17 (but not

yet 18) may not enlist without parental consent. A parent or guardian may,

within 90 days of its inception, terminate the enlistment of a 17-year-old

who enlisted without parental consent, if the person has not yet reached

the age of 18. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1170. _See also_ DOD Directive

1332.14 and service regulations for specific rules on separation of persons

17 years of age on the basis of a parental request. Absent effective action

by a parent or guardian to terminate such an enlistment, court-martial jurisdiction

exists over the person. An application by a parent for release does not deprive

a court-martial of jurisdiction to try a person for offenses committed before

action is completed on such an application.

  Even if a person

lacked capacity to understand the effect of enlistment or did not enlist voluntarily,

a "constructive enlistment" may be established under Article

2(c), which provides:

    Notwithstanding any other

provision of law, a person serving with an armed force who-

submitted voluntary to military authority;

met the mental competency and minimum age qualifications

of sections 504 and 505 of this title at the time of voluntary submission

to military authority [that is, not insane, intoxicated, or under

the age of 17]

received military pay or allowances; and

performed military duties;



is subject to [the code] until such person's

active service has been terminated in accordance with law or regulations

promulgated by the Secretary concerned.

  Even if a person

never underwent an enlistment or induction proceeding of any kind, court-martial

jurisdiction could be established under this provision.

####### (ii) Induction.

Court-martial jurisdiction does not extend to a draftee until: the

 draftee has completed an induction ceremony which was in substantial compliance

with the requirements prescribed by statute and regulations; the draftee

by conduct after an apparent induction, has waived objection to substantive

defects in it; or a "constructive enlistment" under Article 2(c)

exists.

  The fact that a person was improperly inducted (for

example, because of incorrect classification or erroneous denial of exemption)

does not of itself negate court-martial jurisdiction. When a person has made

timely and persistent efforts to correct such an error, court-martial jurisdiction

may be defeated if improper induction is found, depending on all the circumstances

of the case.

####### (iii) Call to active duty.

A member of a reserve component may be called or ordered to active

 duty for a variety of reasons, including training, service in time of war

or national emergency, discipline, or as a result of failure to participate

satisfactorily in unit activities.

  When a person is ordered

to active duty for failure to satisfactorily participate in unit activities,

the order must substantially comply with procedures prescribed by regulations,

to the extent due process requires, for court-martial jurisdiction to exist.

Generally, the person must be given notice of the activation and the reasons

therefor, and an opportunity to object to the activation. A person waives

the right to contest involuntary activation by failure to exercise this right

 within a reasonable time after notice of the right to do so.

###### (B) Termination of jurisdiction over active duty personnel.

As indicated above, the delivery of a valid discharge certificate

or its equivalent ordinarily serves to terminate court-martial jurisdiction.

####### (i) Effect of completion of term of service.

Completion of an enlistment or term of service does not by itself

 terminate court-martial jurisdiction. An original term of enlistment may

be adjusted for a variety of reasons, such as making up time lost for unauthorized

absence. Even after such adjustments are considered, court-martial jurisdiction

normally continues past the time of scheduled separation until a discharge

certificate or its equivalent is delivered or until the Government fails to

act within a reasonable time after the person objects to continued retention.

  As

indicated in subsection (c) of this rule, servicemembers may be retained

past their scheduled time of separation, over protest, by action with a view

to trial while they are still subject to the code. Thus, if action with a

view to trial is initiated before discharge or the effective terminal date

of self-executing orders, a person may be retained beyond the date that the

 period of service would otherwise have expired or the terminal date of such

orders.

####### (ii) Effect of discharge and reenlistment.

For offenses occurring on or after 23 October 1992, under the 1992

 Amendment to Article 3(a), a person who reenlists following a discharge may

be tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service. For offenses

occurring prior to 23 October 1992, a person who reenlists following a discharge

may be tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service only

if the offense was punishable by confinement for five (5) years or more and

could not be tried in the courts of the United States or of a State, a Territory,

or the District of Columbia. However, _see_ (iii)(a) below.

####### (iii) Exceptions.

There are several exceptions to the general principle that court-martial

jurisdiction terminates on discharge or its equivalent.

(a) A person who was subject to the code at the time an offense was

 committed may be tried by court-martial for that offense despite a later

discharge or other termination of that status if:

(1) For offenses occurring on or after 23 October 1992, the person is,

at the time of the court-martial, subject to the code, by reentry into the

armed forces or otherwise. _See_ Article 3(a) as amended by

the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-484,

106 Stat. 2315, 2505 (1992);

(2) For offenses occurring before 23 October 1992,

(A) The offense is one for which a court-martial may adjudge confinement

for five (5) or more years;

(B) The person cannot be tried in the courts of the United States or

of a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia; and

(C) The person is, at the time of the court-martial, subject to the

code, by reentry into the armed forces or otherwise. _See_ Article

3(a) prior to the 1992 amendment.

(b) A person who was subject to the code at the time the offense was

committed is subject to trial by court-martial despite a later discharge

if-

(1) The discharge was issued before the end of the accused's term of

enlistment for the purpose of reenlisting;

(2) The person remains, at the time of the court-martial, subject to

the code; and

(3) The reenlistment occurred after 26 July 1982.

(c) Persons in the custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposed

by a court-martial remain subject to the code and court-martial jurisdiction.

A prisoner who has received a discharge and who remains in the custody of

an armed force may be tried for an offense committed while a member of the

armed forces and before the execution of the discharge as well as for offenses

committed after it.

(d) A person discharged from the armed forces who is later charged with

having fraudulently obtained that discharge is, subject to the statute of

limitations, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge, and is after

apprehension subject to the code while in the custody of the armed forces

for trial. Upon conviction of that charge such a person is subject to trial

by court-martial for any offenses under the code committed before the fraudulent

discharge.

(e) No person who has deserted from the armed forces is relieved from

court-martial jurisdiction by a separation from any later period of service.

(f) When a person's discharge or other separation does not interrupt

the status as a person belonging to the general category of persons subject

to the code, court-martial jurisdiction over that person does not end. For

example, when an officer holding a commission in a Reserve component of an

armed force is discharged from that commission while on active duty because

of acceptance of a commission in a Regular component of that armed force,

without an interval between the periods of service under the two commissions,

that officer's military status does not end. There is merely a change in

personnel status from temporary to permanent officer, and court-martial jurisdiction

over an offense committed before the discharge is not affected.

###### (3) Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Members of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and

Atmospheric Administration become subject to the code when assigned to and

serving with the armed forces.

###### (4) Limitations on jurisdiction over civilians.

Court-martial jurisdiction over civilians under the code is limited by the Constitution and other applicable laws, including as construed in judicial decisions. The exercise of jurisdiction under Article 2(a)(11) in peace time has been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.  Before initiating court-martial proceedings against a civilian, relevant statutes, decisions, service regulations, and policy memoranda should be carefully examined.

###### (5) Members of a Reserve Component.

Members of a reserve component in federal service on active duty,

as well as those in federal service on inactive-duty training, are subject

to the code. Moreover, members of a reserve component are amenable to the

jurisdiction of courts-martial notwithstanding the termination of a period

of such duty. _See_ R.C.M. 204.

### (b) Offenses under the law of war.

Nothing in this rule limits the power of general courts-martial

to try persons under the law of war. _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(B).

### (c) Attachment of jurisdiction over the person.

#### (1) In general.

Court-martial jurisdiction attaches over a person when action with

a view to trial of that person is taken. Once court-martial jurisdiction

over a person attaches, such jurisdiction shall continue for all purposes

of trial, sentence, and punishment, notwithstanding the expiration of that

person's term of service or other period in which that person was subject

to the code or trial by court-martial. When jurisdiction attaches over a

servicemember on active duty, the servicemember may be held on active duty

over objection pending disposition of any offense for which held and shall

remain subject to the code during the entire period.

##### Discussion

Court-martial jurisdiction exists to try a person as long as that

 person occupies a status as a person subject to the code. _See also

_ Article 104 and 106. Thus, a servicemember is subject to court-martial

jurisdiction until lawfully discharged or, when the servicemember's term of

 service has expired, the government fails to act within a reasonable time

on objection by the servicemember to continued retention.

  Court-martial

jurisdiction attaches over a person upon action with a view to trial. Once

court-martial jurisdiction attaches, it continues throughout the trial and

 appellate process, and for purposes of punishment.

  If jurisdiction

has attached before the effective terminal date of self-executing orders,

the person may be held for trial by court-martial beyond the effective terminal

date.

#### (2) Procedure.

Actions by which court-martial jurisdiction attaches include: apprehension;

imposition of restraint, such as restriction, arrest, or confinement; and

preferral of charges.

## Rule 203. Jurisdiction over the offense

To the extent permitted by the Constitution, courts-martial may

try any offense under the code and, in the case of general courts-martial,

the law of war.

### Discussion

#### (a) In general.

Courts-martial have power to try any offense under the code except

 when prohibited from so doing by the Constitution. The rule enunciated in_

Solorio v. United States_, 483 U.S. 435 (1987) is that jurisdiction

of courts-martial depends solely on the accused's status as a person subject

to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and not on the "service-connection"

of the offense charged.

#### (b) Pleading and proof.

Normally, the inclusion of the accused's rank or grade will be sufficient

to plead the service status of the accused. Ordinarily, no allegation of

the accused's armed force or unit is necessary for military members on active

duty. _See_ R.C.M. 307 regarding required specificity of pleadings.

## Rule 204. Jurisdiction over certain reserve component personnel

### (a) Service regulations.

The Secretary concerned shall prescribe regulations setting forth

 rules and procedures for the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction and nonjudicial

punishment authority over reserve component personnel under Article 2(a)(3)

and 2(d), subject to the limitations of this Manual and the UCMJ.

#### Discussion

Such regulations should describe procedures for ordering a reservist

 to active duty for disciplinary action, for the preferral, investigation,

 forwarding, and referral of charges, designation of convening authorities

and commanders authorized to conduct nonjudicial punishment proceedings,

and for other appropriate purposes.

  _See_ definitions

in R.C.M. 103 (Discussion). _See_ paragraph 5e and f, Part

V, concerning limitations on nonjudicial punishments imposed on reservists

while on inactive-duty training.

  Members of the Army National

Guard and the Air National Guard are subject to Federal court-martial jurisdiction

only when the offense concerned is committed while the member is in Federal

service.

### (b) Courts-Martial

#### (1) General and special court-martial proceedings.

A member of a reserve component must be on active duty prior to

 arraignment at a general or special court-martial. A member ordered to active

duty pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty to serve any

adjudged confinement or other restriction on liberty if the order to active

duty was approved in accordance with Article 2(d)(5), but such member may

not be retained on active duty pursuant to Article 2(d) after service of

the confinement or other restriction on liberty. All punishments remaining

 unserved at the time the member is released from active duty may be carried

over to subsequent periods of inactive-duty training or active duty.

##### Discussion

An accused ordered to active duty pursuant to Article 2(d) may be

 retained on active duty after service of the punishment if permitted by other

authority. For example, an accused who commits another offense while on active

duty ordered pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty pursuant

 to R.C.M. 202(c)(1).

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

A member of a reserve component may be tried by summary court-martial

either while on active duty or inactive-duty training. A summary court-martial

conducted during inactive-duty training may be in session only during normal

periods of such training. The accused may not be held beyond such periods

of training for trial or service or any punishment. All punishments remaining

unserved at the end of a period of active duty or the end of any normal period

of inactive duty training may be carried over to subsequent periods of inactive-duty

training or active duty.

##### Discussion

A "normal period" of inactive-duty training does not

 include periods which are scheduled solely for the purpose of conducting

 court-martial proceedings.

### (c) Applicability.

This subsection is not applicable when a member is held on active

duty pursuant to R.C.M. 202(c).

### (d) Changes in type of service.

A member of a reserve component at the time disciplinary action

is initiated, who is alleged to have committed an offense while on active

duty or inactive-duty training, is subject to court-martial jurisdiction

without regard to any change between active and reserve service or within

 different categories of reserve service subsequent to commission of the offense.

This subsection does not apply to a person whose military status was completely

terminated after commission of an offense.

#### Discussion

A member of a regular or reserve component remains subject to court-martial

jurisdiction after leaving active duty for offenses committed prior to such

termination of active duty if the member retains military status in a reserve

component without having been discharged from all obligations of military

service.

  _See_ R.C.M. 202(a), Discussion,

paragraph (2)(B)(ii) and (iii) regarding the jurisdictional effect of a discharge

from military service. A "complete termination" of military status

refers to a discharge relieving the servicemember of any further military

service. It does not include a discharge conditioned upon acceptance of further

 military service.

# CHAPTER III. INITIATION OF CHARGES; APPREHENSION; PRETRIAL RESTRAINT; RELATED MATTERS

## Rule 301. Report of offense

### (a) Who may report.

Any person may report an offense subject to trial by court-martial.

### (b) To whom reports conveyed for disposition.

Ordinarily, any military authority who receives a report of an

offense shall forward as soon as practicable the report and any accompanying

information to the immediate commander of the suspect. Competent authority

superior to that commander may direct otherwise.

#### Discussion

Any military authority may receive a report of an offense. Typically

 such reports are made to law enforcement or investigative personnel, or to

appropriate persons in the chain of command. A report may be made by any

means, and no particular format is required. When a person who is not a law

enforcement official receives a report of an offense, that person should

forward the report to the immediate commander of the suspect unless that

person believes it would be more appropriate to notify law enforcement or

investigative authorities.

  If the suspect is unidentified,

the military authority who receives the report should refer it to a law enforcement

or investigative agency.

  Upon receipt of a report, the immediate

commander of a suspect should refer to R.C.M. 306 (Initial disposition). _

See also_ R.C.M. 302 (Apprehension); R.C.M. 303 (Preliminary inquiry);

R.C.M. 304, 305 (Pretrial restraint, confinement).

## Rule 302. Apprehension

### (a) Definition and scope.

#### (1) Definition.

Apprehension is the taking of a person into custody.

##### Discussion

Apprehension is the equivalent of "arrest" in civilian

terminology. (In military terminology, "arrest" is a form of

restraint. _ See_ Article 9; R.C.M. 304.) _See_ subsection

(c) of this rule concerning the bases for apprehension. An apprehension is

not required in every case; the fact that an accused was never apprehended

does not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial to try the accused. However, _

 see_ R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction.

  An

apprehension is different from detention of a person for investigative purposes,

although each involves the exercise of government control over the freedom

of movement of a person. An apprehension must be based on probable cause,

and the custody initiated in an apprehension may continue until proper authority

is notified and acts under R.C.M. 304 or 305. An investigative detention may

 be made on less than probable cause (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 314(f)),

and normally involves a relatively short period of custody. Furthermore,

an extensive search of the person is not authorized incident to an investigative

detention, as it is with an apprehension. _See_ Mil. R. Evid.

314(f) and (g). This rule does not affect any seizure of the person less

severe than apprehension.

  Evidence obtained as the result

of an apprehension which is in violation of this rule may be challenged under

Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1). Evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful civilian

arrest may be challenged under Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1), (2).

#### (2) Scope.

This rule applies only to apprehensions made by persons authorized

to do so under subsection (b) of this rule with respect to offenses subject

to trial by court-martial. Nothing in this rule limits the authority of federal

law enforcement officials to apprehend persons, whether or not subject to

trial by court-martial, to the extent permitted by applicable enabling statutes

and other law.

##### Discussion

R.C.M. 302 does not affect the authority of any official to detain,

 arrest, or apprehend persons not subject to trial under the code. The rule

does not apply to actions taken by any person in a private capacity.

  Several

federal agencies have broad powers to apprehend persons for violations of

federal laws, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For example,

agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Marshals, and

agents of the Secret Service may apprehend persons for any offenses committed

in their presence and for felonies. 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3052, 3053, 3056.

 Other agencies have apprehension powers include the General Services Administration,

40 U.S.C. &sect; 318 and the Veterans Administration, 38 U.S.C. &sect; 218.

The extent to which such agencies become involved in the apprehension of

persons subject to trial by courts-martial may depend on the statutory authority

of the agency and the agency's formal or informal relationships with the

Department of Defense.

### (b) Who may apprehend.

The following officials may apprehend any person subject to trial

by court-martial:

#### (1) Military law enforcement officials.

Security police, military police, master at arms personnel, members

 of the shore patrol, and persons designated by proper authorities to perform

military criminal investigative, guard, or police duties, whether subject

to the code or not, when in each of the foregoing instances, the official

making the apprehension is in the execution of law enforcement duties;

##### Discussion

Whenever enlisted persons, including police and guards, and civilian

police and guards apprehend any commissioned or warrant officer, such persons

should make an immediate report to the commissioned officer to whom the apprehending

person is responsible.

  The phrase "persons designated

by proper authority to perform military criminal investigative, guard or

police duties" includes special agents of the Defense Criminal Investigative

Service.

#### (2) Commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers.

All commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers on

active duty or inactive duty training;

##### Discussion

Noncommissioned and petty officers not otherwise performing law

 enforcement duties should not apprehend a commissioned officer unless directed

to do so by a commissioned officer or in order to prevent disgrace to the

service or the escape of one who has committed a serious offense.

#### (3) Civilians authorized to apprehend deserters.

Under Article 8, any civilian officer having authority to apprehend

 offenders under laws of the United States or of a State, Territory, Commonwealth,

or possession, or the District of Columbia, when the apprehension is of a

deserter from the armed forces.

##### Discussion

The code specifically provides that any civil officer, whether of

a State, Territory, district, or of the United States may apprehend any deserter. However,

this authority does not permit state and local law enforcement officers to

apprehend persons for other violations of the code. _ See_ Article

8.

### (c) Grounds for apprehension.

A person subject to the code or trial thereunder may be apprehended

 for an offense triable by court-martial upon probable cause to apprehend.

 Probable cause to apprehend exists when there are reasonable grounds to believe

that an offense has been or is being committed and the person to be apprehended

committed or is committing it. Persons authorized to apprehend under subsection

(b)(2) of this rule may also apprehend persons subject to the code who take

part in quarrels, frays, or disorders, wherever they occur.

#### Discussion

"Reasonable grounds" means that there must be the kind

of reliable information that a reasonable, prudent person would rely on which

makes it more likely than not that something is true. A mere suspicion is

not enough but proof which would support a conviction is not necessary. A

person who determines probable cause may rely on the reports of others.

### (d) How an apprehension may be made.

#### (1) In general.

An apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person to be apprehended

that person is in custody. This notice should be given orally or in writing,

but it may be implied by the circumstances.

#### (2) Warrants.

Neither warrants nor any other authorization shall be required for

an apprehension under these rules except as required in subsection (e)(2)

of this rule.

#### (3) Use of force.

Any person authorized under these rules to make an apprehension

may use such force and means as reasonably necessary under the circumstances

to effect the apprehension.

##### Discussion

In addition to any other action required by law or regulation or

 proper military officials, any person making an apprehension under these

rules should maintain custody of the person apprehended and inform as promptly

as possible the immediate commander of the person apprehended, or any official

higher in the chain of command of the person apprehended if it is impractical

 to inform the immediate commander.

### (e) Where an apprehension may be made.

#### (1) In general.

An apprehension may be made at any place, except as provided in

subsection (e)(2) of this rule.

#### (2) Private dwellings.

A private dwelling includes dwellings, on or off a military installation,

such as single family houses, duplexes, and apartments. The quarters may be

owned, leased, or rented by the residents, or assigned, and may be occupied

on a temporary or permanent basis. "Private dwelling" does not

include the following, whether or not subdivided into individual units: living

areas in military barracks, vessels, aircraft, vehicles, tents, bunkers,

field encampments, and similar places. No person may enter a private dwelling

for the purpose of making an apprehension under these rules unless:

(A) Pursuant to consent under Mil. R. Evid. 314(e) or 316(d)(2);

(B) Under exigent circumstances described in Mil. R. Evid. 315(g) or

316(d)(4)(B);

(C) In the case of a private dwelling which is military property or

under military control, or nonmilitary property in a foreign country

(i) if the person to be apprehended is a resident of the private dwelling,

there exists, at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the person

to be apprehended is present in the dwelling, and the apprehension has been

authorized by an official listed in Mil. R. Evid. 315(d) upon a determination

that probable cause to apprehend the person exists; or

(ii) if the person to be apprehended is not a resident of the private

 dwelling, the entry has been authorized by an official listed in Mil. R.

Evid. 315(d) upon a determination that probable cause exists to apprehend

the person and to believe that the person to be apprehended is or will be

 present at the time of the entry;

(D) In the case of a private dwelling not included in subsection (e)(2)(C)

of this rule,

(i) if the person to be apprehended is a resident of the private dwelling,

there exists at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the person to

be apprehended is present and the apprehension is authorized by an arrest

warrant issued by competent civilian authority; or

(ii) if the person to be apprehended is not a resident of the private

 dwelling, the apprehension is authorized by an arrest warrant and the entry

is authorized by a search warrant, each issued by competent civilian authority. A

person who is not a resident of the private dwelling entered may not challenge

the legality of an apprehension of that person on the basis of failure to

secure a warrant or authorization to enter that dwelling, or on the basis

of the sufficiency of such a warrant or authorization. Nothing in this subsection

((e)(2)) affects the legality of an apprehension which is incident to otherwise

lawful presence in a private dwelling.

####### Discussion

For example, if law enforcement officials enter a private dwelling

pursuant to a valid search warrant or search authorization, they may apprehend

persons therein if grounds for an apprehension exist. This subsection is not

 intended to be an independent grant of authority to execute civilian arrest

or search warrants. The authority must derive from an appropriate Federal

or state procedure. _See e.g._ Fed. R. Crim. P. 41 and 28 C.F.R.

60.1.

## Rule 303. Preliminary inquiry into reported offenses

Upon receipt of information that a member of the command is accused

or suspected of committing an offense or offenses triable by court-martial,

the immediate commander shall make or cause to be made a preliminary inquiry

into the charges or suspected offenses.

### Discussion

The preliminary inquiry is usually informal. It may be an examination

of the charges and an investigative report or other summary of expected evidence.

In other cases a more extensive investigation may be necessary. Although

the commander may conduct the investigation personally or with members of

the command, in serious or complex cases the commander should consider whether

to seek the assistance of law enforcement personnel in conducting any inquiry

or further investigation. The inquiry should gather all reasonably available

evidence bearing on guilt or innocence and any evidence relating to aggravation,

extenuation, or mitigation.

  The Military Rules of Evidence

should be consulted when conducting interrogations (_see_

Mil. R. Evid. 301-306), searches (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 311-317),

and eyewitness identifications (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 321).

  If

the offense is one for which the Department of Justice has investigative responsibilities,

 appropriate coordination should be made under the Memorandum of Understanding,_

see_ Appendix 3, and any implementing regulations.

  If

it appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings in

the case, this should be brought to the attention of appropriate authorities. _

See also_ R.C.M. 702 (depositions).

  A person who

is an accuser (_see_ Article 1(9)) is disqualified from convening

 a general or special court-martial in that case. R.C.M. 504(c)(1). Therefore,

when the immediate commander is a general or special court-martial convening

authority, the preliminary inquiry should be conducted by another officer

of the command. That officer may be informed that charges may be preferred

if the officer determines that preferral is warranted.

## Rule 304. Pretrial restraint

### (a) Types of pretrial restraint.

Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a person's

liberty which is imposed before and during disposition of offenses. Pretrial

restraint may consist of conditions on liberty, restriction in lieu of arrest,

 arrest, or confinement.

#### (1) Conditions on liberty.

Conditions on liberty are imposed by orders directing a person to

do or refrain from doing specified acts. Such conditions may be imposed in

conjunction with other forms of restraint or separately.

#### (2) Restriction in lieu of arrest.

Restriction in lieu of arrest is the restraint of a person by oral

or written orders directing the person to remain within specified limits;

a restricted person shall, unless otherwise directed, perform full military

duties while restricted.

#### (3) Arrest.

Arrest is the restraint of a person by oral or written order not

imposed as punishment, directing the person to remain within specified limits;

a person in the status of arrest may not be required to perform full military

duties such as commanding or supervising personnel, serving as guard, or bearing

arms. The status of arrest automatically ends when the person is placed,

by the authority who ordered the arrest or a superior authority, on duty

inconsistent with the status of arrest, but this shall not prevent requiring

the person arrested to do ordinary cleaning or policing, or to take part

in routine training and duties.

#### (4) Confinement.

Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order of

competent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of

offenses. _See_ R.C.M. 305.

##### Discussion

Conditions on liberty include orders to report periodically to a

specified official, orders not to go to a certain place (such as the scene

of the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with specified persons

(such as the alleged victim or potential witnesses). Conditions on liberty

must not hinder pretrial preparation, however. Thus, when such conditions

are imposed, they must by sufficiently flexible to permit pretrial preparation.

  Restriction

in lieu of arrest is a less severe restraint on liberty than is arrest. Arrest

 includes suspension from performing full military duties and the limits of

arrest are normally narrower than those of restriction in lieu of arrest.

The actual nature of the restraint imposed, and not the characterization

of it by the officer imposing it, will determine whether it is technically

an arrest or restriction in lieu of arrest.

  Breach of arrest

or restriction in lieu of arrest or violation of conditions on liberty are

offenses under the code. _See_ paragraphs 16, 19, and 102,

 Part IV. When such an offense occurs, it may warrant appropriate action such

as nonjudicial punishment or court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 306.

In addition, such a breach or violation may provide a basis for the imposition

of a more severe form of restraint.

  R.C.M. 707(a) requires

that the accused be brought to trial within 120 days of preferral of charges

or imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4).

### (b) Who may order pretrial restraint.

#### (1) Of civilians and officers.

Only a commanding officer to whose authority the civilian or officer

is subject may order pretrial restraint of that civilian or officer.

##### Discussion

Civilians may be restrained under these rules only when they are

subject to trial by court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 202.

#### (2) Of enlisted persons.

Any commissioned officer may order pretrial restraint of any enlisted

person.

#### (3) Delegation of authority.

The authority to order pretrial restraint of civilians and commissioned

and warrant officers may not be delegated. A commanding officer may delegate

to warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers authority to order pretrial

restraint of enlisted persons of the commanding officer's command or subject

to the authority of that commanding officer.

#### (4) Authority to withhold.

A superior competent authority may withhold from a subordinate the

 authority to order pretrial restraint.

### (c) When a person may be restrained.

No person may be ordered into restraint before trial except for

probable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial restraint exists when there

is a reasonable belief that:

(1) An offense triable by court-martial has been committed;

(2) The person to be restrained committed it; and

(3) The restraint ordered is required by the circumstances.

##### Discussion

The decision whether to impose pretrial restraint, and, if so, what

type or types, should be made on a case-by-case basis. The factors listed

in the Discussion of R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B) should be considered. The restraint

should not be more rigorous than the circumstances require to ensure the

presence of the person restrained or to prevent foreseeable serious criminal

misconduct.

  Restraint is not required in every case. The

absence of pretrial restraint does not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial.

However, _see_ R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction. _

See_ R.C.M. 305 concerning the standards and procedures governing

pretrial confinement.

### (d) Procedures for ordering pretrial restraint.

Pretrial restraint other than confinement is imposed by notifying

the person orally or in writing of the restraint, including its terms or

limits. The order to an enlisted person shall be delivered personally by

the authority who issues it or through other persons subject to the code.

The order to an officer or a civilian shall be delivered personally by the

authority who issues it or by another commissioned officer. Pretrial confinement

is imposed pursuant to orders by a competent authority by the delivery of

a person to a place of confinement.

### (e) Notice of basis for restraint.

When a person is placed under restraint, the person shall be informed

of the nature of the offense which is the basis for such restraint.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 305(e) concerning additional information

which must be given to a person who is confined. If the person ordering the

restrain is not the commander of the person restrained, that officer should

be notified.

### (f) Punishment prohibited.

Pretrial restraint is not punishment and shall not be used as such.

 No person who is restrained pending trial may be subjected to punishment

or penalty for the offense which is the basis for that restraint. Prisoners

being held for trial shall not be required to undergo punitive duty hours

or training, perform punitive labor, or wear special uniforms prescribed

only for post-trial prisoners. This rule does not prohibit minor punishment

during pretrial confinement for infractions of the rules of the place of confinement.

Prisoners shall be afforded facilities and treatment under regulations of

the Secretary concerned.

#### Discussion

Offenses under the code by a person under restraint may be disposed

 of in the same manner as any other offenses.

### (g) Release.

Except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 305, a person may be released

 from pretrial restraint by a person authorized to impose it. Pretrial restraint

shall terminate when a sentence is adjudged, the accused is acquitted of

all charges, or all charges are dismissed.

#### Discussion

Pretrial restraint may be imposed (or reimposed) if charges are

to be reinstated or a rehearing or "other" trial is to be

ordered.

### (h) Administrative restraint.

Nothing in this rule prohibits limitations on a servicemember imposed

 for operational or other military purposes independent of military justice,

including administrative hold or medical reasons.

#### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 306.

## Rule 305. Pretrial confinement

### (a) In general.

Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order of

 competent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of

 charges.

#### Discussion

No member of the armed forces may be placed in confinement in immediate

association with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not members of

the armed forces of the United States. Article 12. However, if members of

the armed forces of the United States are separated from prisoners of the

other categories mentioned, they may be confined in the same confinement

facilities.

### (b) Who may be confined.

Any person who is subject to trial by court-martial may be confined

 if the requirements of this rule are met.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 201 and 202 and the discussions therein

concerning persons who are subject to trial by courts-martial.

### (c) Who may order confinement.

_See_ R.C.M. 304(b).

#### Discussion

"No provost marshal, commander of a guard, or master at arms

 may refuse to receive or keep any prisoner committed to his charge by a

commissioned officer of the armed forces, when the committing officer furnishes

 a statement, signed by him, of the offense charged against the prisoner."

 Article 11(a).

### (d) When a person may be confined.

No person may be ordered into pretrial confinement except for probable

cause. Probable cause to order pretrial confinement exists when there is

a reasonable belief that:

(1) An offense triable by court-martial has been committed;

(2) The person confined committed it; and

(3) Confinement is required by the circumstances.

##### Discussion

The person who directs confinement should consider the matters

discussed under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule before ordering confinement.

 However, the person who initially orders confinement is not required to make

a detailed analysis of the necessity for confinement. It is often not possible

to review a person's background and character or even the details of an offense

 before physically detaining the person. For example, until additional information

can be secured, it may be necessary to confine a person apprehended in the

course of a violent crime.

  "[W]hen

charged only with an offense normally tried by summary court-martial, [an

accused] shall not ordinarily be paced in confinement." Article

10.

  Confinement should be distinguished from custody. Custody

 is restraint which is imposed by apprehension and which may be, but is not

 necessarily, physical. Custody may be imposed by anyone authorized to apprehend

(_see_ R.C.M. 302(b)), and may continue until a proper authority

under R.C.M. 304(B) is notified and takes action. Thus, a person who has

been apprehended could be physically restrained, but this would not be pretrial

confinement in the sense of this rule until a person authorized to do so

under R.C.M. 304(b) directed confinement.

### (e) Advice to the accused upon confinement.

Each person confined shall be promptly informed of:

(1) The nature of the offenses for which held;

(2) The right to remain silent and that any statement made by the person

may be used against the person;

(3) The right to retain civilian counsel at no expense to the United

States, and the right to request assignment of military counsel; and

(4) The procedures by which pretrial confinement will be reviewed.

### (f) Military counsel.

If requested by the prisoner and such request is made known to

military authorities, military counsel shall be provided to the prisoner before

the initial review under subsection (i) of this rule or within 72 hours of

such a request being first communicated to military authorities, whichever

occurs first. Counsel may be assigned for the limited purpose of representing

the accused only during the pretrial confinement proceedings before charges

are referred. If assignment is made for this limited purpose, the prisoner

shall be so informed. Unless otherwise provided by regulations of the Secretary

concerned, a prisoner does not have a right under this rule to have military

counsel of the prisoner's own selection.

### (g) Who may direct release from confinement.

Any commander of a prisoner, an officer appointed under regulations

 of the Secretary concerned to conduct the review under subsection (i) and/or

 (j) of this rule, or, once charges have been referred, a military judge

detailed to the court-martial to which the charges against the accused have

been referred, may direct release from pretrial confinement. For purposes

of this subsection, "any commander" includes the immediate or

higher commander of the prisoner and the commander of the installation on

which the confinement facility is located.

### (h) Notification and action by commander.

#### (1) Report.

Unless the commander of the prisoner ordered the pretrial confinement,

the commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer into whose charge

the prisoner was committed shall, within 24 hours after that commitment,

cause a report to be made to the commander that shall contain the name of

the prisoner, the offenses charged against the prisoner, and the name of

the person who ordered or authorized confinement.

##### Discussion

This report may be made by any means. Ordinarily, the immediate

 commander of the prisoner should be notified. In unusual cases any commander

to whose authority the prisoner is subject, such as the commander of the

 confinement facility, may be notified. In the latter case, the commander

so notified must ensure compliance with subsection (h)(2) of this rule.

#### (2) Action by commander.

##### (A) Decision.

Not later than 72 hours after the commander's ordering of a prisoner

 into pretrial confinement or, after receipt of a report that a member of

the commander's unit or organization has been confined, whichever situation

is applicable, the commander shall decide whether pretrial confinement will

continue. A commander's compliance with this subsection may also satisfy

the 48-hour probable cause determination of subsection R.C.M. 305(i)(1) below,

provided the commander is a neutral and detached officer and acts within

48 hours of the imposition of confinement under military control. Nothing

in subsections R.C.M. 305(d), R.C.M. 305(i)(1), or this subsection prevents

a neutral and detached commander from completing the 48-hour probable cause

determination and the 72-hour commander's decision immediately after an accused

is ordered into pretrial confinement.

##### (B) Requirements for confinement.

The commander shall direct the prisoner's release from pretrial

 confinement unless the commander believes upon probable cause, that is, upon

 reasonable grounds, that:

(i) An offense triable by a court-martial has been committed;

(ii) The prisoner committed it; and

(iii) Confinement is necessary because it is foreseeable that:

(a) The prisoner will not appear at trial, pretrial hearing, or investigation,

or

(b) The prisoner will engage in serious criminal misconduct; and

(iv) Less severe forms of restraint are inadequate.

 Serious

criminal misconduct includes intimidation of witnesses or other obstruction

of justice, serious injury of others, or other offenses which pose a serious

threat to the safety of the community or to the effectiveness, morale, discipline,

readiness, or safety of the command, or to the national security of the United

States. As used in this rule, "national security" means the national

defense and foreign relations of the United States and specifically includes:

a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations;

a favorable foreign relations position; or a defense posture capable of successfully

resisting hostile or destructive action from within or without, overt or

covert.

####### Discussion

A person should not be confined as a mere matter of convenience

or expedience.

  Some of the factors which should be considered

under this subsection are:

The nature and circumstances of the offenses charged or

 suspected, including extenuating circumstances;

The weight of the evidence against the accused;

The accused's ties to the locale, including family, off-duty

 employment, financial resources, and length of residence;

The accused's character and mental condition;

The accused's service record, including any record of previous

misconduct;

The accused's record of appearance at or flight from other

 pretrial investigations, trials, and similar proceedings; and

The likelihood that the accused can and will commit further

 serious criminal misconduct if allowed to remain at liberty.



  Although the Military Rules of Evidence are not

applicable, the commander should judge the reliability of the information

available. Before relying on the reports of others, the commander must have

a reasonable belief that the information is believable and has a factual basis.

 The information may be received orally or in writing. Information need not

be received under oath, but an oath may add to its reliability. A commander

may examine the prisoner's personnel records, police records, and may consider

the recommendations of others.

  Less serious forms of restraint

must always be considered before pretrial confinement may be approved. Thus

the commander should consider whether the prisoner could be safely returned

to the prisoner's unit, at liberty or under restriction, arrest, or conditions

on liberty. _See_ R.C.M. 304.

##### (C) 72-hour memorandum.

If continued pretrial confinement is approved, the commander shall

 prepare a written memorandum that states the reasons for the conclusion that

the requirements for confinement in subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule have

been met. This memorandum may include hearsay and may incorporate by reference

other documents, such as witness statements, investigative reports, or official

records. This memorandum shall be forwarded to the 7-day reviewing officer

under subsection (i)(2) of this rule. If such a memorandum was prepared by

the commander before ordering confinement, a second memorandum need not be

 prepared; however, additional information may be added to the memorandum

at any time.

### (i) Procedures for review of pretrial confinement.

#### (1) 48-hour probable cause determination.

Review of the adequacy of probable cause to continue pretrial confinement

shall be made by a neutral and detached officer within 48 hours of imposition

of confinement under military control. If the prisoner is apprehended by

civilian authorities and remains in civilian custody at the request of military

authorities, reasonable efforts will be made to bring the prisoner under

military control in a timely fashion.

#### (2) 7-day review of pretrial confinement.

Within 7 days of the imposition of confinement, a neutral and detached

officer appointed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary

concerned shall review the probable cause determination and necessity for

continued pretrial confinement. In calculating the number of days of confinement

for purposes of this rule, the initial date of confinement under military

control shall count as one day and the date of the review shall also count

as one day.

##### (A) Nature of the 7-day review.

###### (i) Matters considered.

The review under this subsection shall include a review of the memorandum submitted by the prisoner's commander under subsection (h)(2)(C) of this rule. Additional written matters may be considered, including any submitted by the prisoner. The prisoner and the prisoner's counsel, if any, shall be allowed to appear before the 7-day reviewing officer and make a statement, if practicable. A representative of the command may also appear before the reviewing officer to make a statement.

###### (ii) Rules of evidence.

Except for Mil. R. Evid., Section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid.

302 and 305, the Military Rules of Evidence shall not apply to the matters

considered.

###### (iii) Standard of proof.

The requirements for confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this

 rule must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.

###### (iv) Victim's right to be reasonably heard.

A victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the 7-day review; the right to confer with the representative of the command and counsel for the government, if any, and the right to be reasonably heard during the review. However, the hearing may not be unduly delayed for this purpose. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel. The victim of an alleged offense shall be notified of these rights in accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

####### Discussion

 Personal appearance by the victim is not required. A victim's right to be reasonably heard at a 7-day review may also be accomplished telephonically, by video teleconference, or by written statement.

##### (B) Extension of time limit.

The 7-day reviewing officer may, for good cause, extend the time

limit for completion of the review to 10 days after the imposition of pretrial

confinement.

##### (C) Action by 7-day reviewing officer.

Upon completion of review, the reviewing officer shall approve continued confinement or order immediate release. If the reviewing officer orders immediate release, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the release, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.

##### (D) Memorandum.

The 7-day reviewing officer's conclusions, including the factual findings on which they are based, shall be set forth in a written memorandum. The memorandum shall also state whether the victim was notified of the review, was given the opportunity to confer with the representative of the command or counsel for the government, and was given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. A copy of the memorandum and all documents considered by the 7-day reviewing officer shall be maintained in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned and provided to the accused or the Government on request.

##### (E) Reconsideration of approval of continued confinement.

The 7-day reviewing officer shall upon request, and after notice

to the parties, reconsider the decision to confine the prisoner based upon

any significant information not previously considered.

### (j) Review by military judge.

Once the charges for which the accused has been confined are referred

to trial, the military judge shall review the propriety of pretrial confinement

upon motion for appropriate relief.

#### (1) Release.

 The military judge shall order release from pretrial confinement

only if:

(A) The 7-day reviewing officer's decision was an abuse of discretion,

and there is not sufficient information presented to the military judge justifying

continuation of pretrial confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule;

(B) Information not presented to the 7-day reviewing officer establishes

 that the prisoner should be released under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule;

 or

(C) The provisions of subsection (i)(1) or (2) of this rule have not

been complied with and information presented to the military judge does not

establish sufficient grounds for continued confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B)

of this rule.

###### Discussion

 Upon a motion for release from pretrial confinement, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the motion and any hearing, the right to confer with counsel representing the government, and the right to be reasonably heard. Inability to reasonably afford a victim these rights shall not delay the proceedings. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(8).

#### (2) Credit.

The military judge shall order administrative credit under subsection

(k) of this rule for any pretrial confinement served as a result of an abuse

of discretion or failure to comply with the provisions of subsections (f),

(h), or (i) of this rule.

### (k) Remedy.

The remedy for noncompliance with subsections (f), (h), (i), or

(j) of this rule shall be an administrative credit against the sentence adjudged

for any confinement served as the result of such noncompliance. Such credit

shall be computed at the rate of 1 day credit for each day of confinement

served as a result of such noncompliance. The military judge may order additional

credit for each day of pretrial confinement that involves an abuse of discretion

or unusually harsh circumstances. This credit is to be applied in addition

to any other credit the accused may be entitled as a result of pretrial confinement

served. This credit shall be applied first against any confinement adjudged.

If no confinement is adjudged, or if the confinement adjudged is insufficient

 to offset all the credit to which the accused is entitled, the credit shall

be applied against hard labor without confinement, restriction, fine, and

forfeiture of pay, in that order, using the conversion formula under R.C.M.

 1003(b)(6) and (7). For purposes of this subsection, 1 day of confinement

shall be equal to 1 day of total forfeiture or a like amount of fine. The

credit shall not be applied against any other form of punishment.

### (l) Confinement after release.

No person whose release from pretrial confinement has been directed

 by a person authorized in subsection (g) of this rule may be confined again

 before completion of trial except upon the discovery, after the order of

 release, of evidence or of misconduct which, either alone or in conjunction

 with all other available evidence, justifies confinement.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 304(b) concerning who may order confinement.

### (m) Exceptions.

#### (1) Operational necessity.

The Secretary of Defense may suspend application of subsections

 (e)(2) and (3), (f), (h)(2)(A) and (C), and (i) of this rule to specific

units or in specified areas when operational requirements of such units or

 in such areas would make application of such provisions impracticable.

#### (2) At sea.

Subsections (e)(2) and (3), (f), (h)(2)(C), and (i) of this rule

shall not apply in the case of a person on board a vessel at sea. In such

situations, confinement on board the vessel at sea may continue only until

the person can be transferred to a confinement facility ashore. Such transfer

shall be accomplished at the earliest opportunity permitted by the operational

requirements and mission of the vessel. Upon such transfer the memorandum

required by subsection (h)(2)(C) of this rule shall be transmitted to the

reviewing officer under subsection (i) of this rule and shall include an

explanation of any delay in the transfer.

### (n) Notice to victim of escaped prisoner.

A victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner for which the prisoner has been placed in pretrial confinement has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the escape of the prisoner, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.

#### Discussion

 For purposes of this rule, the term "victim of an alleged offense" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ.

#### Discussion

Under this subsection the standards for confinement remain the same

 (although the circumstances giving rise to the exception could bear on the

application of those standards). Also, pretrial confinement remains subject

to judicial review. The prisoner's commander still must determine whether

confinement will continue under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule. The suspension

of subsection (h)(2)(A) of this rule removes the 72-hour requirement since

in a combat environment, the commander may not be available to comply with

it. The commander must make the pretrial confinement decision as soon as

reasonably possible, however. (This provision is not suspended under subsection

(2) since the commander of a vessel is always available.)

## Rule 306. Initial disposition

### (a) Who may dispose of offenses.

Each commander has discretion to dispose of offenses by members

of that command. Ordinarily the immediate commander of a person accused or

suspected of committing an offense triable by court-martial initially determines

how to dispose of that offense. A superior commander may withhold the authority

to dispose of offenses in individual cases, types of cases, or generally.

A superior commander may not limit the discretion of a subordinate commander

to act on cases over which authority has not been withheld.

#### Discussion

Each commander in the chain of command has independent, yet overlapping

discretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that officer's authority.

Normally, in keeping with the policy in subsection (b) of this rule, the initial

disposition decision is made by the official at the lowest echelon with the

power to make it. A decision by a commander ordinarily does not bar a different

disposition by a superior authority. _See_ R.C.M. 401(c); 601(f).

Once charges are referred to a court-martial by a convening authority competent

to do so, they may be withdrawn from that court-martial only in accordance

with R.C.M. 604.

  _See_ Appendix 3 with respect

to offenses for which coordination with the Department of Justice is required.

### (b) Policy.

Allegations of offenses should be disposed of in a timely manner

at the lowest appropriate level of disposition listed in subsection (c) of

this rule.

#### Discussion

The disposition decision is one of the most important and difficult decisions facing a commander. Many factors must be taken into consideration and balanced, including, to the extent practicable, the nature of the offenses, any mitigating or extenuating circumstances, the views of the victim as to disposition, any recommendations made by subordinate commanders, the interest of justice, military exigencies, and the effect of the decision on the accused and the command. The goal should be a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair.

  In deciding how an offense should be disposed of, factors the commander should consider, to the extent they are known, include:

  (A) the nature of and circumstances surrounding the offense and the extent of the harm caused by the offense, including the offense's effect on morale, health, safety, welfare, and discipline;

  (B) when applicable, the views of the victim as to disposition;

  (C) existence of jurisdiction over the accused and the offense;

  (D) availability and admissibility of evidence;

  (E) the willingness of the victim or others to testify;

  (F) cooperation of the accused in the apprehension or prosecution of another accused;

  (G) possible improper motives or biases of the person(s) making the allegation(s);

  (H) availability and likelihood of prosecution of the same or similar and related charges against the accused by another jurisdiction;

  (I) appropriateness of the authorized punishment to the particular accused or offense.

### (c) How offenses may be disposed of.

Within the limits of the commander's authority, a commander may

take the actions set forth in this subsection to initially dispose of a charge

or suspected offense.

#### Discussion

Prompt disposition of charges is essential. _See_ R.C.M.

707 (speedy trial requirements).

  Before determining an appropriate

disposition, a commander should ensure that a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M.

303 has been conducted. If charges have not already been preferred, the commander

may, if appropriate, prefer them and dispose of them under this rule. _

But see_ R.C.M. 601 (c) regarding disqualification of an accuser.

  If

charges have been preferred, the commander should ensure that the accused

has been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308, and that charges are in proper

form. _ See_ R.C.M. 307. Each commander who forwards or disposes

of charges may make minor changes therein. _See_ R.C.M. 603(a)

and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge should be preferred

anew. _See_ R.C.M. 603(d).

  When charges are

brought against two or more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, _

see_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3). If it appears that the accused

may lack mental capacity to stand trial or may not have been mentally responsible

at the times of the offenses, _see_ R.C.M. 706; 909; 916(k).

#### (1) No action.

A commander may decide to take no action on an offense. If charges

 have been preferred, they may be dismissed.

##### Discussion

A decision to take no action or dismissal of charges at this stage

 does not bar later disposition of the offenses under subsection (c)(2) through

 (5) of this rule.

  _See_ R.C.M. 401(a) concerning

who may dismiss charges, and R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges.

  When

a decision is made to take no action, the accused should be informed.

#### (2) Administrative action.

A commander may take or initiate administrative action, in addition

 to or instead of other action taken under this rule, subject to regulations

of the Secretary concerned. Administrative actions include corrective measures

such as counseling, admonition, reprimand, exhortation, disapproval, criticism,

censure, reproach, rebuke, extra military instruction, or the administrative

withholding of privileges, or any combination of the above.

##### Discussion

Other administrative measures, which are subject to regulations

of the Secretary concerned, include matters related to efficiency reports,

academic reports, and other ratings; rehabilitation and reassignment; career

field reclassification; administrative reduction for inefficiency; bar to

reenlistment; personnel reliability program reclassification; security classification

changes; pecuniary liability for negligence or misconduct; and administrative

separation.

#### (3) Nonjudicial punishment.

A commander may consider the matter pursuant to Article 15, nonjudicial

punishment. _See_ Part V.

#### (4) Disposition of charges.

Charges may be disposed of in accordance with R.C.M. 401.

##### Discussion

If charges have not been preferred, they may be preferred. _

See_ R.C.M. 307 concerning preferral of charges. However, _

see_ R.C.M. 601(c) concerning disqualification of an accuser.

  Charges

may be disposed of by dismissing them, forwarding them to another commander

for disposition, or referring them to a summary, special, or general court-martial.

Before charges may be referred to a general court-martial, compliance with

R.C.M. 405 and 406 is necessary. Therefore, if appropriate, an investigation

 under R.C.M. 405 may be directed. Additional guidance on these matters is

found in R.C.M. 401-407.

#### (5) Forwarding for disposition.

A commander may forward a matter concerning an offense, or charges,

to a superior or subordinate authority for disposition.

##### Discussion

The immediate commander may lack authority to take action which

that commander believes is an appropriate disposition. In such cases, the

matter should be forwarded to a superior officer with a recommendation as

to disposition. _See also_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2) concerning forwarding

charges. If allegations are forwarded to a higher authority for disposition,

because of lack of authority or otherwise, the disposition decision becomes

 a matter within the discretion of the higher authority.

  A

matter may be forwarded for other reasons, such as for investigation of allegations

and preferral of charges, if warranted (_see_ R.C.M. 303, 307), or so that a subordinate can dispose of the matter.

### (d) National security matters.

If a commander not authorized to convene general courts-martial

finds that an offense warrants trial by court-martial, but believes that

trial would be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to national

security, the matter shall be forwarded to the general court-martial convening

authority for action under R.C.M. 407(b).

## Rule 307. Preferral of charges

### (a) Who may prefer charges.

Any person subject to the code may prefer charges.

#### Discussion

No person may be ordered to prefer charges to which that person

is unable to make truthfully the required oath. _See_ Article

30(a) and subsection (b) of this rule. A person who has been the accuser

or nominal accuser (_see_ Article 1(9)) may not also serve

as the convening authority of a general or special court-martial to which

the charges are later referred. _See_ Articles 22(b) and 23(b);

R.C.M. 601; however, _see_ R.C.M. 1302(b) (summary court-martial

convening authority is not disqualified by being the accuser). A person authorized

to dispose of offenses (_see_ R.C.M. 306(a); 401-404

and 407) should not be ordered to prefer charges when this would disqualify

that person from exercising that person's authority or would improperly restrict

that person's discretion to act on the case. _See_ R.C.M.

104 and 504(c).

  Charges may be preferred against a person

subject to trial by court-martial at any time but should be preferred without

unnecessary delay. _See_ the statute of limitations prescribed

by Article 43. Preferral of charges should not be unnecessarily delayed.

When a good reason exists-as when a person is permitted to continue

a course of conduct so that a ringleader or other conspirators may also be

discovered or when a suspected counterfeiter goes uncharged until guilty

knowledge becomes apparent-a reasonable delay is permissible. However, _

see_ R.C.M. 707 concerning speedy trial requirements.

### (b) How charges are preferred; oath.

A person who prefers charges must:

(1) Sign the charges and specifications under oath before a commissioned

 officer of the armed forces authorized to administer oaths; and

(2) State that the signer has personal knowledge of or has investigated

 the matters set forth in the charges and specifications and that they are

true in fact to the best of that person's knowledge and belief.

##### Discussion

_See_ Article 136 for authority to administer oaths.

The following form may be used to administer the oath:

  "You (swear) (affirm) that you are a person subject

 to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, that you have personal knowledge

of or have investigated the matters set forth in the foregoing charge(s)

and specification(s), and that the same are true in fact to the best of your

 knowledge and belief. (So help you God.)"



  The accuser's belief may be based upon reports

of others in whole or in part.

### (c) How to allege offenses.

#### (1) In general.

The format of charge and specification is used to allege violations

of the code.

##### Discussion

_See_ Appendix 4 for a sample of a Charge Sheet (DD

Form 458).

#### (2) Charge.

A charge states the article of the code, law of war, or local penal

law of an occupied territory which the accused is alleged to have violated.

##### Discussion

The particular subdivision of an article of the code (for example,

Article 118(1)) should not be included in the charge. When there are numerous

infractions of the same article, there will be only one charge, but several

specifications thereunder. There may also be several charges, but each must

allege a violation of a different article of the code. For violations of

the law of war, _see_ (D) below.

###### (A) Numbering charges.

If there is only one charge, it is not numbered. When there is

more than one charge, each charge is numbered by a Roman numeral.

###### (B) Additional charges.

Charges preferred after others have been preferred are labeled "additional

charges" and are also numbered with Roman numerals, beginning with

"I" if there is more than one additional charge. These ordinarily

relate to offenses not known at the time or committed after the original

charges were preferred. Additional charges do not require a separate trial

 if incorporated in the trial of the original charges before arraignment. _

See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2).

###### (C) Preemption.

An offense specifically defined by Articles 81 through 132 may not

be alleged as a violation of Article 134. _See_ paragraph

60c(5)(a) of Part IV. _But see_ subsection (d) of this rule.

###### (D) Charges under the law of war.

In the case of a person subject to trial by general court-martial

for violations of the law of war (_see_ Article 18), the charge

should be: "Violation of the Law of War"; or "Violation

of , " referring to

the local penal law of the occupied territory. _See_ R.C.M.

201(f)(1)(B). _But see_ subsection (d) of this rule. Ordinarily

persons subject to the code should be charged with a specific violation of

the code rather than a violation of the law of war.

#### (3) Specification.

A specification is a plain, concise, and definite statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. A specification is sufficient if it alleges every element of the charged offense expressly or by necessary implication; however, specifications under Article 134 must expressly allege the terminal element. Except for aggravating factors under R.C.M 1003(d) and R.C.M. 1004, facts that increase the maximum authorized punishment must be alleged in order to permit the possible increased punishment. No particular format is required.

##### Discussion

  How to draft specifications. For Article 134 offenses, also refer to paragraph 60c(6) in Part IV.

###### (A) Sample specifications.

Before drafting a specification, the drafter should read the pertinent

provisions of Part IV, where the elements of proof of various offenses and

forms for specifications appear.

[Note:  Be advised that the sample specifications in this Manual have not been amended to comport with _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010) and _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). Practitioners should read the notes above and draft specifications in conformity with the cases cited therein.]

###### (B) Numbering specifications.

If there is only one specification under a charge it is not numbered.

 When there is more than one specification under any charge, the specifications

 are numbered in Arabic numerals. The term "additional" is not

used in connection with the specifications under an additional charge.

###### (C) Name and description of the accused.

####### (i) Name.

The specification should state the accused's full name: first name,

middle name or initial, last name. If the accused is known by more than one

name, the name acknowledged by the accused should be used. If there is no

such acknowledgment, the name believed to be the true name should be listed

first, followed by all known aliases. For example: Seaman John P. Smith,

U.S. Navy, alias Lt. Robert R. Brown, U.S. Navy.

####### (ii) Military association.

The specification should state the accused's rank or grade. If the

rank or grade of the accused has changed since the date of an alleged offense,

and the change is pertinent to the offense charged, the accused should be

identified by the present rank or grade followed by rank or grade on the

date of the alleged offense. For example: In that

Seaman  , then Seaman Apprentice , etc.

####### (iii) Social security number or service number.

The social security number or service number of an accused should

not be stated in the specification.

####### (iv) Basis of personal jurisdiction.

######## (a) Military members on active duty.

Ordinarily, no allegation of the accused's armed force or unit or

organization is necessary for military members on active duty.

######## (b) Persons subject to the code under Article 2(a), subsections (3) through

 (12), or subject to trial by court-martial under Articles 3 or 4.

The specification should describe the accused's armed force, unit

or organization, position, or status which will indicate the basis of jurisdiction.

For example: John Jones, (a person employed by and serving with the U.S. Army

 in the field in time of war) (a person convicted of having obtained a fraudulent

discharge), etc.

###### (D) Date and time of offense

####### (i) In general.

The date of the commission of the offense charged should be stated

in the specification with sufficient precision to identify the offense and

enable the accused to understand what particular act or omission to defend

against.

####### (ii) Use of "on or about."

In alleging the date of the offense it is proper to allege it as

"on or about" a specified day.

####### (iii) Hour.

The exact hour of the offense is ordinarily not alleged except

in certain absence offenses. When the exact time is alleged, the 24-hour

clock should be used. The use of "at or about" is proper.

####### (iv) Extended periods.

When the acts specified extend(s) over a considerable period of

time it is proper to allege it (or them) as having occurred, for example,

"from about 15 June 1983 to about 4 November 1983," or "did

on divers occasions between 15 June 1983 and 4 November 1983."

###### (E) Place of offense.

The place of the commission of the offense charged should be stated

in the specification with sufficient precision to identify the offense and

enable the accused to understand the particular act or omission to defend

against. In alleging the place of the offense, it is proper to allege it

as "at or near" a certain place if the exact place is uncertain.

###### (F) Subject-matter jurisdiction allegations.

Pleading the accused's rank or grade along with the proper elements

of the offense normally will be sufficient to establish subject-matter jurisdiction.

###### (G) Description of offense.

####### (i) Elements.

The elements of the offense must be alleged, either expressly or by necessary implication, except that Article 134 specifications must expressly allege the terminal element. _See_ paragraph 60.c.(6) in Part IV. If a specific intent, knowledge, or state of mind is an element of the offense, it must be alleged.

####### (ii) Words indicating criminality.

If the alleged act is not itself an offense but is made an offense

either by applicable statute (including Articles 133 and 134), or regulation

or custom having the effect of law, then words indicating criminality such

as "wrongfully," "unlawfully," or "without

authority" (depending upon the nature of the offense) should be used

to describe the accused's acts.

####### (iii) Specificity.

The specification should be sufficiently specific to inform the

accused of the conduct charged, to enable the accused to prepare a defense,

and to protect the accused against double jeopardy. Only those facts that

make the accused's conduct criminal ordinarily should be alleged. Specific

 evidence supporting the allegations ordinarily should not be included in

the specifications.

###### (iv) Duplicitousness.

One specification should not allege more than one offense, either

conjunctively (the accused "lost and destroyed") or alternatively

(the accused "lost or destroyed"). However, if two acts or a

series of acts constitute one offense, they may be alleged conjunctively. _

See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(5).

###### (v) Lesser Included Offenses.

The elements of the contemplated lesser included offense should be compared with the elements of the greater offense to determine if the elements of the lesser offense are derivative of the greater offense and vice versa. _See_ discussion following paragraph 3.b.(1)(c) in Part IV and the related analysis in Appendix 23.

###### (H) Other considerations in drafting specifications.

####### (i) Principals.

All principals are charged as if each was the perpetrator. _

See_ paragraph 1 of Part IV for a discussion of principals.

####### (ii) Victim.

In the case of an offense against the person or property of a person,

the first name, middle initial and last name of such person should be alleged,

if known. If the name of the victim is unknown, a general physical description

may be used. If this cannot be done, the victim may be described as "a

person whose name is unknown." Military rank or grade should be alleged,

and must be alleged if an element of the offense, as in an allegation of

disobedience of the command of a superior officer. If the person has no military

position, it may otherwise be necessary to allege the status as in an allegation

of using provoking words toward a person subject to the code. _ See

_ paragraph 42 of Part IV.

####### (iii) Property.

In describing property generic terms should be used, such as "a

watch" or "a knife," and descriptive details such as make,

model, color, and serial number should ordinarily be omitted. In some instances,

however, details may be essential to the offense, so they must be alleged.

For example: the length of a knife blade may be important when alleging a

violation of general regulation prohibiting carrying a knife with a blade

that exceeds a certain length.

####### (iv) Value.

When the value of property or other amount determines the maximum

punishment which may be adjudged for an offense, the value or amount should

be alleged, for in such a case increased punishments that are contingent

upon value may not be adjudged unless there is an allegation, as well as

proof, of a value which will support the punishment. If several articles

of different kinds are the subject of the offense, the value of each article

should be stated followed by a statement of the aggregate value. Exact value

should be stated, if known. For ease of proof an allegation may be "of

a value not less than ." If only an approximate

value is known, it may be alleged as "of a value of about ." If the value of an item is unknown but obviously minimal,

the term "of some value" may be used. These principles apply to

allegations of amounts.

####### (v) Documents.

When documents other than regulations or orders must be alleged

(for example, bad checks in violation of Article 123a), the document may

be set forth verbatim (including photocopies and similar reproductions) or

may be described, in which case the description must be sufficient to inform

the accused of the offense charged.

####### (vi) Orders.

######## (a) General orders.

A specification alleging a violation of a general order or regulation

(Article 92(1)) must clearly identify the specific order or regulation allegedly

violated. The general order or regulation should be cited by its identifying

title or number, section or paragraph, and date. It is not necessary to recite

the text of the general order or regulation verbatim.

######## (b) Other orders.

If the order allegedly violated is an "other lawful order"

(Article 92(2)), it should be set forth verbatim or described in the specification.

When the order is oral, _see_ (vii) below.

######## (c) Negating exceptions.

If the order contains exceptions, it is not necessary that the specification

contain a specific allegation negating the exceptions. However, words of

criminality may be required if the alleged act is not necessarily criminal.

 _See_ subsection (G)(ii) of this discussion.

####### (vii) Oral statements.

When alleging oral statements the phrase "or words to that

effect" should be added.

####### (viii) Joint offense.

In the case of a joint offense each accused may be charged separately

as if each accused acted alone or all may be charged together in a single

specification. For example:

(a) If Doe and Roe are joint perpetrators of an offense and it is intended

to charge and try both at the same trial, they should be charged in a single

specification as follows:

       "In

that Doe and Roe, acting jointly and pursuant to a common intent, did.&puncsp;.&puncsp;.&puncsp;."

(b) If it is intended that Roe will be tried alone or that Roe will

be tried with Doe at a common trial, Roe may be charged in the same manner

as if Roe alone had committed the offense. However, to show in the specification

that Doe was a joint actor with Roe, even though Doe is not to be tried with

Roe, Roe may be charged as follows:

       "In

that Roe did, in conjunction with Doe, .&puncsp;.&puncsp;.&puncsp;."

####### (ix) Matters in aggravation.

Matters in aggravation that do not increase the maximum authorized

punishment ordinarily should not be alleged in the specification. Prior convictions

need not be alleged in the specification to permit increased punishment.

Aggravating factors in capital cases should not be alleged in the specification.

 Notice of such factors is normally provided in accordance with R.C.M. 1004(b)(1).

####### (x) Abbreviations.

Commonly used and understood abbreviations may be used, particularly

 abbreviations for ranks, grades, units and organizations, components, and

 geographic or political entities, such as the names of states or countries.

#### (4) Multiple offenses.

Charges and specifications alleging all known offenses by an accused may be preferred at the same time. Each specification shall state only one offense. What is substantially one transaction should not be made the basis for an unreasonable multiplication of charges against one person. Unreasonable multiplication of charges is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12); multiplicity is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B); and punishment limitations are addressed in R.C.M. 1003(c)(1)(C).

##### Discussion

The prohibition against unreasonable multiplication of charges addresses those features of military law that increase the potential for overreaching in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is based on reasonableness, and has no foundation in Constitutional rights. To determine if charges are unreasonably multiplied, see R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Because prosecutors are free to plead in the alternative, it may be reasonable to charge two or more offenses that arise from one transaction if sufficient doubt exists as to the facts or the law. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included offense thereof be separately charged. See also Part IV, paragraph 3, and R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.

  _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12) and 1003(c)(1)(C). For example, a person should

 not be charged with both failure to report for a routine scheduled duty,

such as reveille, and with absence without leave if the failure to report

occurred during the period for which the accused is charged with absence without

 leave. There are times, however, when sufficient doubt as to the facts or

the law exists to warrant making one transaction the basis for charging two

or more offenses. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included

 offense thereof be separately charged.

  _See also

_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.

#### (5) Multiple offenders.

A specification may name more than one person as an accused if each

person so named is believed by the accuser to be a principal in the offense

which is the subject of the specification.

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 601(e)(3) concerning joinder of

accused.

  A joint offense is one committed by two or more

persons acting together with a common intent. Principals may be charged jointly

with the commission of the same offense, but an accessory after the fact

cannot be charged jointly with the principal whom the accused is alleged to

have received, comforted, or assisted. Offenders are properly joined only

if there is a common unlawful design or purpose; the mere fact that several

persons happen to have committed the same kinds of offenses at the time, although

material as tending to show concert of purpose, does not necessarily establish

this. The fact that several persons happen to have absented themselves without

leave at about the same time will not, in the absence of evidence indicating

a joint design, purpose, or plan justify joining them in one specification,

for they may merely have been availing themselves of the same opportunity.

In joint offenses the participants may be separately or jointly charged.

However, if the participants are members of different armed forces, they must

be charged separately because their trials must be separately reviewed. The

preparation of joint charges is discussed in subsection (c)(3) Discussion

(H) (viii)_(a)_ of this rule. The advantage of a joint charge

 is that all accused will be tried at one trial, thereby saving time, labor,

and expense. This must be weighed against the possible unfairness to the

accused which may result if their defenses are inconsistent or antagonistic.

 An accused cannot be called as a witness except upon that accused's own request.

If the testimony of an accomplice is necessary, the accomplice should not

be tried jointly with those against whom the accomplice is expected to testify. _

See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 306.

  _See_ R.C.M.

603 concerning amending specifications.

  _See_ R.C.M.

906(b)(5) and (6) concerning motions to amend specifications and bills of

particulars.

### (d) Harmless error in citation.

Error in or omission of the designation of the article of the code

or other statute, law of war, or regulation violated shall not be ground

for dismissal of a charge or reversal of a conviction if the error or omission

did not prejudicially mislead the accused.

## Rule 308. Notification to accused of charges

### (a) Immediate commander.

The immediate commander of the accused shall cause the accused to

be informed of the charges preferred against the accused, and the name of

the person who preferred the charges and of any person who ordered the charges

to be preferred, if known, as soon as practicable.

#### Discussion

When notice is given, a certificate to that effect on the Charge

Sheet should be completed. _See_ Appendix 4.

### (b) Commanders at higher echelons.

When the accused has not been informed of the charges, commanders

at higher echelons to whom the preferred charges are forwarded shall cause

the accused to be informed of the matters required under subsection (a) of

this rule as soon as practicable.

### (c) Remedy.

The sole remedy for violation of this rule is a continuance or recess

of sufficient length to permit the accused to adequately prepare a defense,

and no relief shall be granted upon a failure to comply with this rule unless

the accused demonstrates that the accused has been hindered in the preparation

of a defense.

# CHAPTER IV. FORWARDING AND DISPOSITION OF CHARGES

## Rule 401. Forwarding and disposition of charges in general

### (a) Who may dispose of charges.

Only persons authorized to convene courts-martial or to administer

nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 may dispose of charges. A superior

competent authority may withhold the authority of a subordinate to dispose

 of charges in individual cases, types of cases, or generally.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 504 as to who may convene courts-martial

and paragraph 2 of Part V as to who may administer nonjudicial punishment.

If the power to convene courts-martial and to administer nonjudicial punishment

 has been withheld, a commander may not dispose of charges under this rule.

  Ordinarily

charges should be forwarded to the accused's immediate commander for initial

consideration as to disposition. Each commander has independent discretion

to determine how charges will be disposed of, except to the extent that the

commander's authority has been withheld by superior competent authority. _

See also_ R.C.M. 104.

  Each commander who forwards

or disposes of charges may make minor changes therein. _See_ R.C.M.

603(a) and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge should

be preferred anew. _See_ R.C.M. 603(d). If a commander is an

accuser (_see_ Article 1(9); 307(a)) that commander is ineligible

to refer such charges to a general or special court-martial. _See_ R.C.M.

 601(c). However, see R.C.M. 1302(b) (accuser may refer charges to a summary

court-martial).

### (b) Prompt determination.

When a commander with authority to dispose of charges receives charges,

that commander shall promptly determine what disposition will be made in

the interest of justice and discipline.

#### Discussion

In determining what level of disposition is appropriate, _

see_ R.C.M. 306(b) and (c). When charges are brought against two

or more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, _see_ R.C.M.

 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3). If it appears that the accused may lack mental capacity

to stand trial or may not have been mentally responsible at the times of

the offenses, _see_ R.C.M. 706; 909; 916(k).

  As

to the rules concerning speedy trial, _see_ R.C.M. 707. _

See also_ Articles 10; 30; 33; 98.

  Before determining

an appropriate disposition, a commander who receives charges should ensure

that: (1) a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M. 303 has been conducted; (2) the

accused has been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308; and (3) the charges

are in proper form.

### (c) How charges may be disposed of.

Unless the authority to do so has been limited or withheld by superior

competent authority, a commander may dispose of charges by dismissing any

or all of them, forwarding any or all of them to another commander for disposition,

or referring any or all of them to a court-martial which the commander is

empowered to convene. Charges should be disposed of in accordance with the

policy in R.C.M. 306(b).

#### Discussion

A commander may dispose of charges individually or collectively.

If charges are referred to a court-martial, ordinarily all known charges

should be referred to a single court-martial.

  _See

_ Appendix 3 when the charges may involve matters in which the Department

of Justice has an interest.

#### (1) Dismissal.

When a commander dismisses charges further disposition under R.C.M.

306(c) of the offenses is not barred.

##### Discussion

Charges are ordinarily dismissed by lining out and initialing the

deleted specifications or otherwise recording that a specification is dismissed.

When all charges and specifications are dismissed, the accuser and the accused

ordinarily should be informed.

  A charge should be dismissed

when it fails to state an offense, when it is unsupported by available evidence,

or when there are other sound reasons why trial by court-martial is not appropriate.

 Before dismissing charges because trial would be detrimental to the prosecution

of a war or harmful to national security, _see_ R.C.M. 401(d);

407(b).

  If the accused has already refused nonjudicial punishment,

charges should not be dismissed with a view to offering nonjudicial punishment

unless the accused has indicated willingness to accept nonjudicial punishment

if again offered. The decision whether to dismiss charges in such circumstances

is within the sole discretion of the commander concerned.

  Charges

may be amended in accordance with R.C.M. 603.

  It is appropriate

to dismiss a charge and prefer another charge anew when, for example, the

original charge failed to state an offense, or was so defective that a major

amendment was required (_see_ R.C.M. 603(d)), or did not adequately

reflect the nature or seriousness of the offense.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C) concerning the effect of dismissing charges

after the court-martial has begun.

#### (2) Forwarding charges.

##### (A) Forwarding to a superior commander.

When charges are forwarded to a superior commander for disposition,

the forwarding commander shall make a personal recommendation as to disposition.

If the forwarding commander is disqualified from acting as convening authority

in the case, the basis for the disqualification shall be noted.

###### Discussion

A commander's recommendation is within that commander's sole discretion.

No authority may direct a commander to make a specific recommendation as

to disposition.

  When charges are forwarded to a superior

commander with a view to trial by general or special court-martial, they

should be forwarded by a letter of transmittal or indorsement. To the extent

practicable without unduly delaying forwarding the charges, the letter should

include or carry as enclosures: a summary of the available evidence relating

to each offense; evidence of previous convictions and nonjudicial punishments

 of the accused; an indication that the accused has been offered and refused

nonjudicial punishment, if applicable; and any other matters required by

superior authority or deemed appropriate by the forwarding commander. Other

matters which may be appropriate include information concerning the accused's

background and character of military service, and a description of any unusual

circumstances in the case. The summary of evidence should include available

witness statements, documentary evidence, and exhibits. When practicable,

copies of signed statements of the witnesses should be forwarded, as should

copies of any investigative or laboratory reports. Forwarding charges should

not be delayed, however, solely to obtain such statements or reports when

it otherwise appears that sufficient evidence to warrant trial is or will

be available in time for trial. If because of the bulk of documents or exhibits,

it is impracticable to forward them with the letter of transmittal, they

should be properly preserved and should be referred to in the letter of transmittal.

  When

it appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings in

the case or that a deposition may be appropriate, that matter should be brought

to the attention of the convening authority promptly and should be noted

in the letter of transmittal.

  When charges are forwarded

with a view to disposition other than trial by general or special court-martial,

they should be accompanied by sufficient information to enable the authority

receiving them to dispose of them without further investigation.

##### (B) Other cases.

When charges are forwarded to a commander who is not a superior

of the forwarding commander, no recommendation as to disposition may be made.

###### Discussion

Except when directed to forward charges, a subordinate commander

may not be required to take any specific action to dispose of charges. _

See_ R.C.M. 104. _See also_ paragraph 1d(2) of Part

V. When appropriate, charges may be sent or returned to a subordinate commander

for compliance with procedural requirements. _See_, for example,

R.C.M. 303 (preliminary inquiry); R.C.M. 308 (notification to accused of charges).

#### (3) Referral of charges.

_See_ R.C.M. 403, 404, 407, 601.

### (d) National security matters.

If a commander who is not a general court-martial convening authority

finds that the charges warrant trial by court-martial but believes that trial

would probably be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to national

security, the charges shall be forwarded to the officer exercising general

court-martial convening authority.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 407(b).

## Rule 402. Action by commander not authorized to convene courts-martial

When in receipt of charges, a commander authorized to administer

nonjudicial punishment but not authorized to convene courts-martial may:

(1) Dismiss any charges; or

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,

the effect of dismissal, and options for further action.

(2) Forward them to a superior commander for disposition.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2) for additional guidance concerning

 forwarding charges. _See generally_ R.C.M. 303 (preliminary

inquiry); 308 (notification to accused of charges) concerning other duties

of the immediate commander when in receipt of charges.

  When

the immediate commander is authorized to convene courts-martial, _

see_ R.C.M. 403, 404, or 407, as appropriate.

## Rule 403. Action by commander exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction

### (a) Recording receipt.

Immediately upon receipt of sworn charges, an officer exercising

summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command shall cause the hour

and date of receipt to be entered on the charge sheet.

#### Discussion

_See_ Article 24 and R.C.M. 1302(a) concerning who

may exercise summary court-martial jurisdiction.

  The entry

indicating receipt is important because it stops the running of the statute

of limitations. _See_ Article 43; R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B). Charges

may be preferred and forwarded to an officer exercising summary court-martial

jurisdiction over the command to stop the running of the statute of limitations

even though the accused is absent without authority.

### (b) Disposition.

When in receipt of charges a commander exercising summary court-martial

jurisdiction may:

(1) Dismiss any charges;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,

the effect of dismissing charges, and options for further action.

(2) Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a

subordinate commander for disposition;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding charges

to a subordinate. When appropriate, charges may be forwarded to a subordinate

even if the subordinate previously considered them.

(3) Forward any charges to a superior commander for disposition;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(A) for guidance concerning

forwarding charges to a superior.

(4) Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a summary court-martial

for trial; or

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1302(c) concerning referral of charges

to a summary court-martial.

(5) Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct a

pretrial investigation under R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward the

report of investigation with the charges to a superior commander for disposition.

##### Discussion

An investigation should be directed when it appears that the charges

are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _

See_ R.C.M. 405. If an investigation of the subject matter already

has been conducted, _see_ R.C.M. 405(b).

## Rule 404. Action by commander exercising special court-martial jurisdiction

When in receipt of charges, a commander exercising special court-martial

jurisdiction may:

(a) Dismiss any charges;

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,

the effect of dismissing charges, and options for further action.

(b) Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a

 subordinate commander for disposition;

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding charges

to a subordinate. When appropriate, charges may be forwarded to a subordinate

even if that subordinate previously considered them.

(c) Forward any charges to a superior commander for disposition;

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(A) for guidance concerning

forwarding charges to a superior.

(d) Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a summary court-martial

or to a special court-martial for trial; or

#### Discussion

_See_ Article 23 and R.C.M. 504(b)(2) concerning

who may convene special courts-martial.

  _See_ R.C.M.

601 concerning referral of charges to a special court-martial. _See

_ R.C.M. 1302(c) concerning referral of charges to a summary court-martial.

(e) Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct a preliminary hearing under R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward the report of preliminary hearing with the charges to a superior commander for disposition.

#### Discussion

 A preliminary hearing should be directed when it appears that the charges are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _See_ R.C.M. 405. If a preliminary hearing of the subject matter already has been conducted, see R.C.M. 405(b) and 405(e)(2).

## Rule 404A. Disclosure of matters following direction of preliminary hearing

(a) When a convening authority directs a preliminary hearing under R.C.M. 405, counsel for

the government shall, subject to R.C.M. 404A(b)-(d) below, within 5 days of issuance of the Article 32 appointing order, provide to the defense the following information or matters:

(1) Charge sheet;

(2) Article 32 appointing order;

(3) Documents accompanying the charge sheet on which the preferral decision was based;

(4) Documents provided to the convening authority when deciding to direct the preliminary hearing;

(5) Documents the counsel for the government intends to present at the preliminary hearing; and

(6) Access to tangible objects counsel for the government intends to present at the preliminary hearing.

### (b) Contraband.

If items covered by subsection 404A(a) above are contraband, the disclosure required under this rule is a reasonable opportunity to inspect said contraband prior to the hearing.

### (c) Privilege.

If items covered by subsection 404A(a) above are privileged, classified or otherwise protected under Section V of Part III, no disclosure of those items is required under this rule. However, counsel for the government may disclose privileged, classified, or otherwise protected information covered by subsection 404A(a) above if authorized by the holder of the privilege, or in the case of Mil. R. Evid. 505 or 506, if authorized by a competent authority.

### (d) Protective order if privileged information is disclosed.

If the government agrees to disclose to the accused information to which the protections afforded by Section V of Part III may apply, the convening authority, or other person designated by regulation of the Secretary concerned, may enter an appropriate protective order, in writing, to guard against the compromise of information disclosed to the accused. The terms of any such protective order may include prohibiting the disclosure of the information except as authorized by the authority issuing the protective order, as well as those terms specified by Mil. R. Evid. 505(g)(2)-(6) or 506(g)(2)(5).

#### Discussion

 The purposes of this rule are to provide the accused with the documents used to make the determination to prefer charges and direct a preliminary hearing, and to allow the accused to prepare for the preliminary hearing. This rule is not intended to be a tool for discovery and does not impose the same discovery obligations found in R.C.M. 405 prior to amendments required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 or R.C.M. 701. Additional rules for disclosure of witnesses and other evidence in the preliminary hearing are provided in R.C.M. 405(g).

## Rule 405. Preliminary hearing

### (a) In general.

Except as provided in subsection (k) of this rule, no charge or specification may be referred to a general court-martial for trial until completion of a preliminary hearing in substantial compliance with this rule. A preliminary hearing conducted under this rule is not intended to serve as a means of discovery and will be limited to an examination of those issues necessary to determine whether there is probable cause to conclude that an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it; to determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; to consider the form of the charge(s); and to recommend the disposition that should be made of the charge(s). Failure to comply with this rule shall have no effect on the disposition of the charge(s) if the charge(s) is not referred to a general court-martial.

#### Discussion

 The function of the preliminary hearing is to ascertain and impartially weigh the facts needed for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing is not intended to perfect a case against the accused and is not intended to serve as a means of discovery or to provide a right of confrontation required at trial. Determinations and recommendations of the preliminary hearing officer are advisory.

 Failure to substantially comply with the requirements of Article 32, which failure prejudices the accused, may result in delay in disposition of the case or disapproval of the proceedings. See R.C.M. 905(b)(1) and 906(b)(3) concerning motions for appropriate relief relating to the preliminary hearing.

 The accused may waive the preliminary hearing. See subsection (k) of this rule. In such case, no preliminary hearing need be held. However, the convening authority authorized to direct the preliminary hearing may direct that it be conducted notwithstanding the waiver.

### (b) Earlier preliminary hearing.

If a preliminary hearing of the subject matter of an offense has been conducted before the accused is charged with an offense, and the accused was present at the preliminary hearing and afforded the rights to counsel, cross-examination, and presentation of evidence required by this rule, no further preliminary hearing is required.

### (c) Who may direct a preliminary hearing.

Unless prohibited by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a preliminary hearing may be directed under this rule by any court-martial convening authority. That authority may also give procedural instructions not inconsistent with these rules.

### (d) Personnel.

#### (1) Preliminary hearing officer.

Whenever practicable, the convening authority directing a preliminary hearing under this rule shall detail an impartial judge advocate certified under Article 27(b), not the accuser, as a preliminary hearing officer, who shall conduct the preliminary hearing and make a report that addresses whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense or offenses have been committed and that the accused committed the offense(s); whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; the form of the charges(s); and a recommendation as to the disposition of the charge(s).

 When the appointment of a judge advocate as the preliminary hearing officer is not practicable, or in exceptional circumstances in which the interest of justice warrants, the convening authority directing the preliminary hearing may detail an impartial commissioned officer, who is not the accuser, as the preliminary hearing officer. If the preliminary hearing officer is not a judge advocate, an impartial judge advocate certified under Article 27(b) shall be available to provide legal advice to the preliminary hearing officer.

 When practicable, the preliminary hearing officer shall be equal or senior in grade to the military counsel detailed to represent the accused and the government at the preliminary hearing. The Secretary concerned may prescribe additional limitations on the appointment of preliminary hearing officers.

 The preliminary hearing officer shall not depart from an impartial role and become an advocate for either side. The preliminary hearing officer is disqualified to act later in the same case in any other capacity.

##### Discussion

 The preliminary hearing officer, if not a judge advocate, should be an officer in the grade of O-4 or higher. The preliminary hearing officer may seek legal advice concerning the preliminary hearing officer's responsibilities from an impartial source, but may not obtain such advice from counsel for any party or counsel for a victim.

#### (2) Counsel to represent the United States.

A judge advocate, not the accuser, shall serve as counsel to represent the United States, and shall present evidence on behalf of the government relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing as set forth in subsection (a) of this rule.

#### (3) Defense counsel.

The commander who directed the investigation may also, as a matter

of discretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail:

##### (A) Detailed counsel.

Except as provided in subsection (d)(3)(B) of this rule, military counsel certified in accordance with Article 27(b) shall be detailed to represent the accused.

##### (B) Individual military counsel.

The accused may request to be represented by individual military counsel. Such requests shall be acted on in accordance with R.C.M. 506(b).

##### (C) Civilian counsel.

The accused may be represented by civilian counsel at no expense to the United States. Upon request, the accused is entitled to a reasonable time to obtain civilian counsel and to have such counsel present for the preliminary hearing. However, the preliminary hearing shall not be unduly delayed for this purpose. Representation by civilian counsel shall not limit the rights to military counsel under subsections (d)(3)(A) and (B) of this rule.

#### (4) Others.

The convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing may also, as a matter of discretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail:

(A) A reporter; and

(B) An interpreter.

### (e) Scope of preliminary hearing.

(1) The preliminary hearing officer shall limit the inquiry to the examination of evidence, including witnesses, necessary to:

(A) Determine whether there is probable cause to believe an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it;

(B) Determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused;

(C) Consider whether the form of the charge(s) is proper; and

(D) Make a recommendation as to the disposition of the charge(s).

(2) If evidence adduced during the preliminary hearing indicates that the accused committed any uncharged offense(s), the preliminary hearing officer may examine evidence and hear witnesses relating to the subject matter of such offense(s) and make the findings and recommendations enumerated in subsection (e)(1) of this rule regarding such offense(s) without the accused first having been charged with the offense. The accused's rights under subsection (f)(2) of this rule, and, where it would not cause undue delay to the proceedings, subsection (g) of this rule, are the same with regard to both charged and uncharged offenses. When considering uncharged offenses identified during the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing officer shall inform the accused of the general nature of each uncharged offense considered, and otherwise afford the accused the same opportunity for representation, cross examination, and presentation afforded during the preliminary hearing of any charged offense.

##### Discussion

 Except as set forth in subsection (h) below, the Mil. R. Evid. do not apply at a preliminary hearing. Except as prohibited elsewhere in this rule, a preliminary hearing officer may consider evidence, including hearsay, which would not be admissible at trial.

### (f) Rights of the accused.

(1) Prior to any preliminary hearing under this rule the accused shall have the right to:

(A) Notice of any witnesses that the government intends to call at the preliminary hearing and copies of or access to any written or recorded statements made by those witnesses that relate to the subject matter of any charged offense;

(i) For purposes of this rule, a "written statement" is one that is signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government; and

(ii) For purposes of this rule, a "recorded statement" is an oral statement made by the witness that is recorded contemporaneously with the making of the oral statement and contained in a digital or other recording or a transcription thereof that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government.

(B) Notice of, and reasonable access to, any other evidence that the government intends to offer at the preliminary hearing; and

(C) Notice of, and reasonable access to, evidence that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government that negates or reduces the degree of guilt of the accused for an offense charged.

(2) At any preliminary hearing under this rule the accused shall have the right to:

(A) Be advised of the charges under consideration;

(B) Be represented by counsel;

(C) Be informed of the purpose of the preliminary hearing;

(D) Be informed of the right against self-incrimination under Article 31;

(E) Except in the circumstances described in R.C.M. 804(c)(2), be present throughout the taking of evidence;

(F) Cross-examine witnesses on matters relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing;

(G) Present matters in defense and mitigation relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing; and

############ Discussion

 Unsworn statements by the accused, unlike those made under R.C.M. 1001(c)(2), shall be limited to matters in defense and mitigation.

(H) Make a statement relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

### (g) Production of Witnesses and Other Evidence.

#### (1) Military Witnesses.

(A) Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government the names of proposed military witnesses whom the accused requests that the government produce to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the requested form of the testimony, in accordance with the timeline established by the preliminary hearing officer. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and will seek to secure the witness's testimony for the hearing; or (2) the government objects to the proposed defense witness on the grounds that the testimony would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(B) If the government objects to the proposed defense witness, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(C) If the government does not object to the proposed defense military witness or the preliminary hearing officer determines that the military witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary, counsel for the government shall request that the commanding officer of the proposed military witness make that person available to provide testimony. The commanding officer shall determine whether the individual is available based on operational necessity or mission requirements, except that a victim, as defined in this rule, who declines to testify shall be deemed to be not available. If the commanding officer determines that the military witness is available, counsel for the government shall make arrangements for that individual's testimony. The commanding officer's determination of unavailability due to operational necessity or mission requirements is final. The military witness's commanding officer determines the availability of the witness and, if there is a dispute among the parties, determines whether the witness testifies in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony.

###### Discussion

 A commanding officer's determination of whether an individual is available, as well as the means by which the individual is available, is a balancing test. The more important the testimony of the witness, the greater the difficulty, expense, delay, or effect on military operations must be to deny production of the witness. Based on operational necessity and mission requirements, the witness's commanding officer may authorize the witness to testify by video teleconference, telephone, or similar means of remote testimony. Factors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; and the likelihood of significant interference with operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.

#### (2) Civilian Witnesses.

##### (A) Military witnesses.

Defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government the names of proposed civilian witnesses whom the accused requests that the government produce to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the requested form of the testimony, in accordance with the timeline established by the preliminary hearing officer. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and will seek to secure the witness's testimony for the hearing; or (2) the government objects to the proposed defense witness on the grounds that the testimony would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(B) If the government objects to the proposed defense witness, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

##### (C) Evidence generally.

If the government does not object to the proposed civilian witness or the preliminary hearing officer determines that the civilian witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary, counsel for the government shall invite the civilian witness to provide testimony and, if the individual agrees, shall make arrangements for that witness's testimony. If expense to the government is to be incurred, the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, or the convening authority's delegate, shall determine whether the witness testifies in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony.

###### Discussion

 Factors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-person testimony. Civilian witnesses may not be compelled to provide testimony at a preliminary hearing. Civilian witnesses may be paid for travel and associated expenses to testify at a preliminary hearing. _See_ Department of Defense Joint Travel Regulations.

##### (3) Other evidence.

###### (A) Evidence under the control of the government.

(i) Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government a list of evidence under the control of the government the accused requests the government produce to the defense for introduction at the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer may set a deadline by which defense requests must be received. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the evidence; or (2) the government objects to production of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(ii) If the government objects to production of the evidence, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the evidence should be produced.  The preliminary hearing officer shall determine whether the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the hearing. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that the evidence shall be produced, counsel for the government shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the evidence.

###### (B) Evidence not under the control of the government.

(i) Evidence not under the control of the government may be obtained through noncompulsory means or by _subpoenas duces tecum_ issued by counsel for the government in accordance with the process established by R.C.M. 703.

(ii) Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government a list of evidence not under the control of the government that the accused requests the government obtain. The preliminary hearing officer may set a deadline by which defense requests must be received. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ for the evidence; or (2) the government objects to production of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(iii) If the government objects to production of the evidence, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the evidence should be produced.  If the preliminary hearing officer determines that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and that the issuance of _subpoenas duces tecum_ would not cause undue delay to the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing officer shall direct counsel for the government to issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ for the defense-requested evidence. Failure on the part of counsel for the government to issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ directed by the preliminary hearing officer shall be noted by the preliminary hearing officer in the report of preliminary hearing.

######## Discussion

 A _subpoena duces tecum_ to produce books, papers, documents, data, electronically stored information, or other objects for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 may be issued by counsel for the government. The preliminary hearing officer has no authority to issue a _subpoena duces tecum_. However, the preliminary hearing officer may direct counsel for the government to issue a _subpoena duces tecum_ for defense-requested evidence.

### (h) Military Rules of Evidence.

The Military Rules of Evidence do not apply in preliminary hearings under this rule except as follows:

(1) Mil. R. Evid. 301-303 and 305 shall apply in their entirety.

(2) Mil. R. Evid. 412 shall apply in any case that includes a charge defined as a sexual offense in Mil. R. Evid. 412(d), except that Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) shall not apply.

(3) Mil. R. Evid., Section V, Privileges, shall apply, except that Mil. R. Evid. 505(f)-(h) and (j); 506(f)-(h), (j), (k), and (m); and 514(d)(6) shall not apply.

(4) In applying these rules to a preliminary hearing, the term "military judge," as used in these rules, shall mean the preliminary hearing officer, who shall assume the military judge's authority to exclude evidence from the preliminary hearing, and who shall, in discharging this duty, follow the procedures set forth in the rules cited in subsections (h)(1)-(3) of this rule. However, the preliminary hearing officer is not authorized to order production of communications covered by Mil. R. Evid. 513 and 514.

##### Discussion

 The prohibition against ordering production of evidence does not preclude a preliminary hearing officer from considering evidence offered by the parties under Mil. R. Evid. 513 or 514.

(5) Failure to meet the procedural requirements of the applicable rules of evidence shall result in exclusion of that evidence from the preliminary hearing, unless good cause is shown.

##### Discussion

 Before considering evidence offered under subsection (h)(2), the preliminary hearing officer must determine that the evidence offered is relevant for the limited scope and purpose of the hearing, that the evidence is proper under subsection (h)(2), and that the probative value of such evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the alleged victim's privacy. The preliminary hearing officer shall set forth any limitations on the scope of such evidence.

 Evidence offered under subsection (h)(2) above must be protected pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552a. Although Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) allows admission of evidence of the victim's sexual behavior or predisposition at trial when it is constitutionally required, there is no constitutional requirement at an Article 32 hearing. There is likewise no constitutional requirement for a pretrial hearing officer to consider evidence under Mil. R. Evid. 514(d)(6) at an Article 32 hearing. Evidence deemed admissible by the preliminary hearing officer should be made a part of the report of preliminary hearing. _See_ subsection (j)(2)(C), _infra_. Evidence not considered, and the testimony taken during a closed hearing, should not be included in the report of preliminary hearing but should be appropriately safeguarded or sealed. The preliminary hearing officer and counsel representing the government are responsible for careful handling of any such evidence to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure.

### (i) Procedure.

#### (1) Generally.

 The preliminary hearing shall begin with the preliminary hearing officer informing the accused of the accused's rights under subsection (f) of this rule. Counsel for the government will then present evidence. Upon the conclusion of counsel for the government's presentation of evidence, defense counsel may present matters in defense and mitigation consistent with subsection (f) of this rule. For the purposes of this rule, "matters in mitigation" are defined as matters that may serve to explain the circumstances surrounding a charged offense. Both counsel for the government and defense shall be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The preliminary hearing officer may also question witnesses called by the parties. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that additional evidence is necessary to satisfy the requirements of subsection (e) above, the preliminary hearing officer may provide the parties an opportunity to present additional testimony or evidence relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer shall not consider evidence not presented at the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer shall not call witnesses _sua sponte_.

##### Discussion

 A preliminary hearing officer may only consider evidence within the limited purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall ensure that the scope of the hearing is limited to that purpose. When the preliminary hearing officer finds that evidence offered by either party is not within the scope of the hearing, he shall inform the parties and halt the presentation of that information.

#### (2) Notice to and presence of the victim(s).

(A) The victim(s) of an offense under the UCMJ has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of a preliminary hearing relating to the alleged offense and the reasonable right to confer with counsel for the government. For the purposes of this rule, a "victim" is a person who is alleged to have suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the matters set forth in a charge or specification under consideration and is named in one of the specifications under consideration.

(B) A victim of an offense under consideration at the preliminary hearing is not required to testify at the preliminary hearing.

(C) A victim has the right not to be excluded from any portion of a preliminary hearing related to the alleged offense, unless the preliminary hearing officer, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines the testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at the proceeding.

(D) A victim shall be excluded if a privilege set forth in Mil. R. Evid. 505 or 506 is invoked or if evidence is offered under Mil. R. Evid. 412, 513, or 514, for charges other than those in which the victim is named.

#### (3) Presentation of evidence.

##### (A) Testimony.

 Witness testimony may be provided in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony. All testimony shall be taken under oath, except that the accused may make an unsworn statement. The preliminary hearing officer shall only consider testimony that is relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

###### Discussion

 The following oath may be given to witnesses:

"Do you (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you God)?"

 The preliminary hearing officer is required to include in the report of the preliminary hearing, at a minimum, a summary of the substance of all testimony. See subsection (j)(2)(B) of this rule.

 All preliminary hearing officer notes of testimony and recordings of testimony should be preserved until the end of trial.

 If during the preliminary hearing any witness subject to the Code is suspected of an offense under the Code, the preliminary hearing officer should comply with the warning requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 305(c), (d), and, if necessary, (e).

 Bearing in mind that counsel are responsible for preparing and presenting their cases, the preliminary hearing officer may ask a witness questions relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the hearing. When questioning a witness, the preliminary hearing officer may not depart from an impartial role and become an advocate for either side.

##### (B) Other evidence.

 If relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing, and not cumulative, a preliminary hearing officer may consider other evidence, in addition to or in lieu of witness testimony, including statements, tangible evidence, or reproductions thereof, offered by either side, that the preliminary hearing officer determines is reliable. This other evidence need not be sworn.

#### (4) Access by spectators.

 Access by spectators to all or part of the proceedings may be restricted or foreclosed in the discretion of the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing or the preliminary hearing officer. Preliminary hearings are public proceedings and should remain open to the public whenever possible. When an overriding interest exists that outweighs the value of an open preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing may be closed to spectators. Any closure must be narrowly tailored to achieve the overriding interest that justified the closure. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conclude that no lesser methods short of closing the preliminary hearing can be used to protect the overriding interest in the case. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conduct a case-by-case, witness-by-witness, circumstance-by-circumstance analysis of whether closure is necessary. If a convening authority or preliminary hearing officer believes closing the preliminary hearing is necessary, the convening authority or preliminary hearing officer must make specific findings of fact in writing that support the closure. The written findings of fact must be included in the report of preliminary hearing. Examples of overriding interests may include: preventing psychological harm or trauma to a child witness or an alleged victim of a sexual crime, protecting the safety or privacy of a witness or alleged victim, protecting classified material, and receiving evidence where a witness is incapable of testifying in an open setting.

##### (5) Presence of accused.

 The further progress of the taking of evidence shall not be prevented and the accused shall be considered to have waived the right to be present whenever the accused:

(A) After being notified of the time and place of the proceeding is voluntarily absent; or

(B) After being warned by the preliminary hearing officer that disruptive conduct will cause removal from the proceeding, persists in conduct which is such as to justify exclusion from the proceeding.

##### (6) Recording of the preliminary hearing.

 Counsel for the government shall ensure that the preliminary hearing is recorded by a suitable recording device. A victim, as defined by subsection (i)(2)(A) of this rule, may request access to, or a copy of, the recording of the proceedings. Upon request, counsel for the government shall provide the requested access to, or a copy of, the recording to the victim not later than a reasonable time following dismissal of the charges, unless charges are dismissed for the purpose of re-referral, or court-martial adjournment. A victim is not entitled to classified information or access to or a copy of a recording of closed sessions which the victim did not have the right to attend under subsections (i)(2)(C) or (i)(2)(D) of this rule.

###### Discussion

Counsel for the government shall provide victims with access to, or a copy of, the recording of the proceedings in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe.

##### (7) Objections.

 Any objection alleging failure to comply with this rule shall be made to the convening authority via the preliminary hearing officer.

##### (8) Sealed exhibits and proceedings.

 The preliminary hearing officer has the authority to order exhibits, proceedings, or other matters sealed as described in R.C.M. 1103A.

### (j) Report of preliminary hearing.

#### (1) In general.

The preliminary hearing officer shall make a timely written report of the preliminary hearing to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing.

##### Discussion

 If practicable, the charges and the report of preliminary hearing should be forwarded to the general court-martial convening authority within 8 days after an accused is ordered into arrest or confinement. _See_ Article 33, UCMJ.

#### (2) Contents.

The report of preliminary hearing shall include:

(A) A statement of names and organizations or addresses of defense counsel and whether defense counsel was present throughout the taking of evidence, or if not present the reason why;

(B) The substance of the testimony taken on both sides;

(C) Any other statements, documents, or matters considered by the preliminary hearing officer, or recitals of the substance or nature of such evidence;

(D) A statement that an essential witness may not be available for trial;

(E) An explanation of any delays in the preliminary hearing;

(F) A notation if counsel for the government failed to issue a subpoena duces tecum that was directed by the preliminary hearing officer;

(G) The preliminary hearing officer's determination as to whether there is probable cause to believe the offense(s) listed on the charge sheet or otherwise considered at the preliminary hearing occurred;

(H) The preliminary hearing officer's determination as to whether there is probable cause to believe the accused committed the offense(s) listed on the charge sheet or otherwise considered at the preliminary hearing;

(I) The preliminary hearing officer's determination as to whether a court-martial has jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused;

(J) The preliminary hearing officer's determination as to whether the charge(s) and specification(s) are in proper form; and

(K) The recommendations of the preliminary hearing officer regarding disposition of the charge(s).

###### Discussion

 The preliminary hearing officer may include any additional matters useful to the convening authority in determining disposition. The preliminary hearing officer may recommend that the charges and specifications be amended or that additional charges be preferred. _See_ R.C.M. 306 and 401 concerning other possible dispositions.

#### (3) Sealed exhibits and proceedings.

. If the report of preliminary hearing contains exhibits, proceedings, or other matters ordered sealed by the preliminary hearing officer in accordance with R.C.M. 1103A, counsel for the government shall cause such materials to be sealed so as to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure.

#### (4) Distribution of the report.

The preliminary hearing officer shall cause the report to be delivered to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing. That convening authority shall promptly cause a copy of the report to be delivered to each accused.

#### (5) Objections.

Any objection to the report shall be made to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, via the preliminary hearing officer, within 5 days of its receipt by the accused. This subsection does not prohibit a convening authority from referring the charge(s) or taking other action within the 5-day period.

### (k) Waiver.

The accused may waive a preliminary hearing under this rule. In addition, failure to make a timely objection under this rule, including an objection to the report, shall constitute waiver of the objection. Relief from the waiver may be granted by the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, a superior convening authority, or the military judge, as appropriate, for good cause shown.

#### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3).

 The convening authority who receives an objection may direct that the preliminary hearing be reopened or take other action, as appropriate.

## Rule 406. Pretrial advice

### (a) In general.

Before any charge may be referred for trial by a general court-martial,

it shall be referred to the staff judge advocate of the convening authority

for consideration and advice.

#### Discussion

A pretrial advice need not be prepared in cases referred to special

or summary courts-martial. A convening authority may, however, seek the advice

of a lawyer before referring charges to such a court-martial. When charges

have been withdrawn from a general court-martial (_see_ R.C.M.

604) or when a mistrial has been declared in a general court-martial (_

see_ R.C.M. 915), supplementary advice is necessary before the charges

may be referred to another general court-martial.

  The staff

judge advocate may make changes in the charges and specifications in accordance

 with R.C.M. 603.

### (b) Contents.

The advice of the staff judge advocate shall include a written and

signed statement which sets forth that person's:

(1) Conclusion with respect to whether each specification alleges an

 offense under the code;

(2) Conclusion with respect to whether the allegation of each offense

is warranted by the evidence indicated in the report of preliminary hearing (if

there is such a report);

(3) Conclusion with respect to whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction

over the accused and the offense; and

(4) Recommendation of the action to be taken by the convening authority.

##### Discussion

The staff judge advocate is personally responsible for the pretrial

advice and must make an independent and informed appraisal of the charges

and evidence in order to render the advice. Another person may prepare the

advice, but the staff judge advocate is, unless disqualified, responsible

for it and must sign it personally. Grounds for disqualification in a case

include previous action in that case as preliminary hearing officer, military judge,

trial counsel, defense counsel, or member.

  The advice need not set forth the underlying analysis or rationale for its conclusions. Ordinarily, the charge sheet, forwarding letter, endorsements, and report of investigation

are forwarded with the pretrial advice. In addition, the pretrial advice

should include when appropriate: a brief summary of the evidence; discussion

of significant aggravating, extenuating, or mitigating factors; any recommendations

for disposition of the case by commanders or others who have forwarded the

charges; and the recommendation of the Article 32 preliminary hearing officer.

However, there is no legal requirement to include such information, and failure

to do so is not error.

  Whatever matters are included in

the advice, whether or not they are required, should be accurate. Information

which is incorrect or so incomplete as to be misleading may result in a determination

that the advice is defective, necessitating appropriate relief. _

See_ R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3).

  The standard of proof to be applied in R.C.M. 406(b)(2) is probable cause. _See_ R.C.M. 601(d)(1). Defects in the pretrial advice are not jurisdictional and are raised

by pretrial motion. _See_ R.C.M.905(b)(1) and its Discussion.

### (c) Distribution.

A copy of the advice of the staff judge advocate shall be provided

to the defense if charges are referred to trial by general court-martial.

## Rule 407. Action by commander exercising general court-martial jurisdiction

### (a) Disposition.

When in receipt of charges, a commander exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction may:

(1) Dismiss any charges;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges

and the effect of dismissing charges.

(2) Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a

subordinate commander for disposition;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding charges

to a subordinate.

  A subordinate commander may not be required

to take any specific action or to dispose of charges. _See_ R.C.M.

104. _See also_ paragraph 1d(2) of Part V. When appropriate,

charges may be sent or returned to a subordinate commander for compliance

with procedural requirements. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 303

(preliminary inquiry); R.C.M. 308 (notification to accused of charges).

(3) Forward any charges to a superior commander for disposition;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401 (c)(2)(A) for guidance concerning

forwarding charges to a superior.

(4) Refer charges to a summary court-martial or a special court-martial

 for trial;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 601; 1302(c).

(5) Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct a

pretrial investigation under R.C.M. 405, after which additional action under

this rule may be taken;

##### Discussion

An investigation should be directed when it appears the charges

are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _

See_ R.C.M. 405. If an investigation of the subject matter already

has been conducted. _See_ R.C.M. 405(b).

(6) Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a general court-martial.

##### Discussion

_See_ Article 22 and R.C.M. 504(b)(1) concerning who

may exercise general court-martial jurisdiction.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 601 concerning referral of charges. _See_ R.C.M.

306 and 401 concerning other dispositions.

### (b) National security matters.

When in receipt of charges the trial of which the commander exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction finds would probably be inimical to the

prosecution of a war or harmful to national security, that commander, unless

otherwise prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned, shall determine

whether trial is warranted and, if so, whether the security considerations

involved are paramount to trial. As the commander finds appropriate, the

commander may dismiss the charges, authorize trial of them, or forward them

to a superior authority.

#### Discussion

In time of war, charges may be forwarded to the Secretary concerned

 for disposition under Article 43(e). Under Article 43(e), the Secretary may

 take action suspending the statute of limitations in time of war.

or the Judge Advocate General's designee, certified to be qualified for duty

as a military judge of a general court-martial, and assigned and directly

responsible to the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate General's

designee. The Secretary concerned may prescribe additional qualifications

for military judges in special courts-martial. As used in this subsection

court-martial without a military judge.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 801 for description of some of the general

duties of the military judge.

  Military judges assigned

as general court-martial judges may perform duties in addition to the primary

duty of judge of a general court-martial only when such duties are assigned

or approved by the Judge Advocate General, or a designee, of the service

which a military judge in special courts-martial may perform may be prescribed

in regulations of the Secretary concerned.

### (d) Counsel.

Only persons certified under Article 27(b) as competent to perform

duties as counsel in courts-martial by the Judge Advocate General of the

armed force of which the counsel is a member may be detailed as defense counsel

or associate defense counsel in general or special courts-martial or as trial

counsel in general courts-martial.

##### Discussion

To be certified by the Judge Advocate General concerned under Article

27(b), a person must be a member of the bar of a Federal court or the highest

court of a State. The Judge Advocate General concerned may establish additional

 requirements for certification.

  When the accused has individual

military or civilian defense counsel, the detailed counsel is "associate

counsel" unless excused from the case. _See_ R.C.M. 506(b)(3).

#### (2) Other military counsel.

Any commissioned officer may be detailed as trial counsel in special

courts-martial, or as assistant trial counsel or assistant defense counsel

in general or special courts-martial. The Secretary concerned may establish

additional qualifications for such counsel.

#### (3) Qualifications of individual military and civilian defense counsel.

Individual military or civilian defense counsel who represents an

accused in a court-martial shall be:

(A) A member of the bar of a Federal court or of the bar of the highest

court of a State; or

(B) If not a member of such a bar, a lawyer who is authorized by a recognized

licensing authority to practice law and is found by the military judge to

be qualified to represent the accused upon a showing to the satisfaction

of the military judge that the counsel has appropriate training and familiarity

with the general principles of criminal law which apply in a court-martial.

###### Discussion

In making such a determination-particularly in the case of

civilian defense counsel who are members only of a foreign bar-the

military judge also should inquire into:

(i) the availability of the counsel at times at which sessions of the

court-martial have been scheduled;

(ii) whether the accused wants the counsel to appear with military defense

counsel;

(iii) the familiarity of the counsel with spoken English;

(iv) practical alternatives for discipline of the counsel in the event

of misconduct;

(v) whether foreign witnesses are expected to testify with whom the

counsel may more readily communicate than might military counsel; and

(vi) whether ethnic or other similarity between the accused and the counsel

 may facilitate communication and confidence between the accused and civilian

 defense counsel.

#### (4) Disqualifications.

No person shall act as trial counsel or assistant trial counsel

or, except when expressly requested by the accused, as defense counsel or

associate or assistant defense counsel in any case in which that person is

or has been:

(A) The accuser;

(B) An investigating officer;

(C) A military judge; or

(D) A member.

No person who has acted as counsel for a party may

serve as counsel for an opposing party in the same case.

###### Discussion

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is presumed that

a person who, between referral and trial of a case, has been detailed as

counsel for any party to the court-martial to which the case has been referred,

 has acted in that capacity.

#### (5) Duties of trial and assistant trial counsel.

The trial counsel shall prosecute cases on behalf of the United

States and shall cause the record of trial of such cases to be prepared.

Under the supervision of trial counsel an assistant trial counsel may perform

any act or duty which trial counsel may perform under law, regulation, or

custom of the service.

##### Discussion

###### (A) General duties before trial.

Immediately upon receipt of referred charges, trial counsel should

cause a copy of the charges to be served upon accused. _See_ R.C.M.

602.

  Trial counsel should: examine the charge sheet and allied

papers for completeness and correctness; correct (and initial) minor errors

or obvious mistakes in the charges but may not without authority make any

substantial changes (_see_ R.C.M. 603); and assure that the

information about the accused on the charge sheet and any evidence of previous

convictions are accurate.

###### (B) Relationship with convening authority.

Trial counsel should: report to the convening authority any substantial

irregularity in the convening orders, charges, or allied papers; report an

actual or anticipated reduction of the number of members below quorum to

the convening authority; bring to the attention of the convening authority

any case in which trial counsel finds trial inadvisable for lack of evidence

or other reasons.

###### (C) Relations with the accused and defense counsel.

Trial counsel must communicate with a represented accused only

through the accused's defense counsel. However, _see_ R.C.M.

 602. Trial counsel may not attempt to induce an accused to plead guilty or

 surrender other important rights.

###### (D) Preparation for trial.

Trial counsel should: ensure that a suitable room, a reporter (if

authorized), and necessary equipment and supplies are provided for the court-martial;

obtain copies of the charges and specifications and convening orders for

each member and all personnel of the court-martial; give timely notice to

the members, other parties, other personnel of the court-martial, and witnesses

for the prosecution and (if known) defense of the date, time, place, and

uniform of the meetings of the court-martial; ensure that any person having

custody of the accused is also informed; comply with applicable discovery

rules (_see_ R.C.M. 701); prepare to make a prompt, full,

and orderly presentation of the evidence at trial; consider the elements

of proof of each offense charged, the burden of proof of guilt and the burdens

of proof on motions which may be anticipated, and the Military Rules of Evidence;

secure for use at trial such legal texts as may be available and necessary

to sustain the prosecution's contentions; arrange for the presence of witnesses

and evidence in accordance with R.C.M. 703; prepare to make an opening statement

of the prosecution's case (_see_ R.C.M. 913); prepare to conduct

the examination and cross-examination of witnesses; and prepare to make final

argument on the findings and, if necessary, on sentencing (_see_ R.C.M.

919; 1001(g)).

###### (E) Trial.

Trial counsel should bring to the attention of the military judge

any substantial irregularity in the proceedings. Trial counsel should not

allude to or disclose to the members any evidence not yet admitted or reasonably

expected to be admitted in evidence or intimate, transmit, or purport to

transmit to the military judge or members the views of the convening authority

or others as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, an appropriate sentence,

or any other matter within the discretion of the court-martial.

###### (F) Post-trial duties.

Trial counsel must promptly provide written notice of the findings

and sentence adjudged to the convening authority or a designee, the accused's

immediate commander, and (if applicable) the officer in charge of the confinement

 facility (_see_ R.C.M. 1101(a)), and supervise the preparation,

authentication, and distribution of copies of the record as required by these

rules and regulations of the Secretary concerned (_see_ R.C.M.

1103; 1104).

###### (G) Assistant trial counsel.

An assistant trial counsel may act in that capacity only under the

supervision of the detailed trial counsel. Responsibility for trial of a

case may not devolve to an assistant not qualified to serve as trial counsel.

Unless the contrary appears, all acts of an assistant trial counsel are presumed

to have been done by the direction of the trial counsel. An assistant trial

counsel may not act in the absence of trial counsel at trial in a general

 court-martial unless the assistant has the qualifications required of a trial

counsel. _See_ R.C.M. 805(c).

#### (6) Duties of defense and associate or assistant defense counsel.

Defense counsel shall represent the accused in matters under the

code and these rules arising from the offenses of which the accused is then

suspected or charged. Under the supervision of the defense counsel an associate

or assistant defense counsel may perform any act or duty which a defense counsel

may perform under law, regulation, or custom of the service.

##### Discussion

###### (A) Initial advice by military defense counsel.

Defense counsel should promptly explain to the accused the general

 duties of the defense counsel and inform the accused of the rights to request

 individual military counsel of the accused's own selection, and of the effect

 of such a request, and to retain civilian counsel. If the accused wants to

 request individual military counsel, the defense counsel should immediately

inform the convening authority through trial counsel and, if the request

is approved, serve as associate counsel if the accused requests and the convening

authority permits. Unless the accused directs otherwise, military counsel

will begin preparation of the defense immediately after being detailed without

waiting for approval of a request for individual military counsel or retention

of civilian counsel. _See R.C.M. 506._

###### (B) General duties of defense counsel.

Defense counsel must: guard the interests of the accused zealously

 within the bounds of the law without regard to personal opinion as to the

guilt of the accused; disclose to the accused any interest defense counsel

may have in connection with the case, any disqualification, and any other

matter which might influence the accused in the selection of counsel; represent

the accused with undivided fidelity and may not disclose the accused's secrets

or confidences except as the accused may authorize (_see also_ Mil.

 R. Evid. 502). A defense counsel designated to represent two or more co-accused

 in a joint or common trial or in allied cases must be particularly alert

to conflicting interests of those accused. Defense counsel should bring such

 matters to the attention of the military judge so that the accused's understanding

and choice may be made a matter of record. _See_ R.C.M. 901(d)(4)(D).

  Defense counsel must explain to the accused: the elections

available as to composition of the court-martial and assist the accused to

make any request necessary to effect the election (_see_ R.C.M.

903); the right to plead guilty or not guilty and the meaning and effect

of a plea of guilty; the rights to introduce evidence, to testify or remain

silent, and to assert any available defense; and the rights to present evidence

during sentencing and the rights of the accused to testify under oath, make

an unsworn statement, and have counsel make a statement on behalf of the accused.

These explanations must be made regardless of the intentions of the accused

as to testifying and pleading.

  Defense counsel should try

to obtain complete knowledge of the facts of the case before advising the

accused, and should give the accused a candid opinion of the merits of the

case.

###### (C) Preparation for trial.

Defense counsel may have the assistance of trial counsel in obtaining

the presence of witnesses and evidence for the defense. _See_ R.C.M.

703.

  Defense counsel should consider the elements of proof

of the offenses alleged and the pertinent rules of evidence to ensure that

evidence that the defense plans to introduce is admissible and to be prepared

to object to inadmissible evidence offered by the prosecution.

  Defense

counsel should: prepare to make an opening statement of the defense case

(_see_ R.C.M. 913(b)); and prepare to examine and cross-examine witnesses,

and to make final argument on the findings and, if necessary, on sentencing

(_see_ R.C.M. 919; 1001(g)).

###### (D) Trial.

Defense counsel should represent and protect the interests of the

accused at trial.

  When a trial proceeds in the absence of the accused,

defense counsel must continue to represent the accused.

###### (E) Post-trial duties.

####### (i) Deferment of confinement.

If the accused is sentenced to confinement, the defense counsel

must explain to the accused the right to request the convening authority

to defer service of the sentence to confinement and assist the accused in

making such a request if the accused chooses to make one. _See_ R.C.M.

1101(c).

####### (ii) Examination of the record; appellate brief.

The defense counsel should in any case examine the record for accuracy

and note any errors in it. This notice may be forwarded for attachment to

the record. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(C). _See_

also R.C.M. 1103(i)(1)(B).

####### (iii) Submission of matters.

If the accused is convicted, the defense counsel may submit to the

convening authority matters for the latter's consideration in deciding whether

to approve the sentence or to disapprove any findings. _See_

R.C.M. 1105. Defense counsel should discuss with the accused the right to

submit matters to the convening authority and the powers of the convening

authority in taking action on the case. Defense counsel may also submit a

 brief of any matters counsel believes should be considered on further review.

####### (iv) Appellate rights.

Defense counsel must explain to the accused the rights to appellate

review that apply in the case, and advise the accused concerning the exercise

of those rights. If the case is subject to review by the Court of Criminal

Appeals, defense counsel should explain the powers of that court and advise

the accused of the right to be represented by counsel before it. _

See_ R.C.M. 1202 and 1203. Defense counsel should also explain the

possibility of further review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

and the Supreme Court. _See_ R.C.M. 1204 and 1205. If the

case may be examined in the office of the Judge Advocate General under Article

69(a), defense counsel should explain the nature of such review to the accused. _

See_ R.C.M. 1201(b)(1). Defense counsel must explain the consequences

of waiver of appellate review, when applicable, and, if the accused elects

to waive appellate review, defense counsel will assist in preparing the waiver. _

See_ R.C.M. 1110. If the accused waives appellate review, or if it

is not available, defense counsel should explain that the case will be reviewed

by a judge advocate and should submit any appropriate matters for consideration

by the judge advocate. _ See_ R.C.M. 1112. The accused should

be advised of the right to apply to the Judge Advocate General for relief

under Article 69(b) when such review is available. _See_ R.C.M.

1201(b)(3).

####### (v) Examination of post-trial recommendation.

When the post-trial recommendation is served on defense counsel,

defense counsel should examine it and reply promptly in writing, noting any

errors or omissions. Failure to note defects in the recommendation waives

them. _See_ R.C.M. 1106(f).

###### (F) Associate or assistant defense counsel.

Associate or assistant counsel may act in that capacity only under

the supervision and by the general direction of the defense counsel. A detailed

defense counsel becomes associate defense counsel when the accused has individual

military or civilian counsel and detailed counsel is not excused. Although

associate counsel acts under the general supervision of the defense counsel,

associate defense counsel may act without such supervision when circumstances

require. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 805(c). An assistant defense

counsel may do this only if such counsel has the qualifications to act as

defense counsel. Responsibility for trial of a case may not devolve upon

an assistant who is not qualified to serve as defense counsel. An assistant

defense counsel may not act in the absence of the defense counsel at trial

unless the assistant has the qualifications required of a defense counsel. _

See also_ R.C.M. 805. Unless the contrary appears, all acts of an

assistant or associate defense counsel are presumed to have been done under

the supervision of the defense counsel.

### (e) Interpreters, reporters, escorts, bailiffs, clerks, and guards.

#### (1) Qualifications.

The qualifications of interpreters and reporters may be prescribed

by the Secretary concerned. Any person who is not disqualified under subsection

(e)(2) of this rule may serve as escort, bailiff, clerk, or orderly, subject

to removal by the military judge.

#### (2) Disqualifications.

In addition to any disqualifications which may be prescribed by

the Secretary concerned, no person shall act as interpreter, reporter, escort,

bailiff, clerk, or orderly in any case in which that person is or has been

in the same case:

(A) The accuser;

(B) A witness;

(C) An investigating officer;

(D) Counsel for any party; or

(E) A member of the court-martial or of any earlier court-martial of

which the trial is a rehearing or new or other trial.

#### (3) Duties.

In addition to such other duties as the Secretary concerned may

prescribe, the following persons may perform the following duties.

##### (A) Interpreters.

Interpreters shall interpret for the court-martial or for an accused

who does not speak or understand English.

###### Discussion

The accused also may retain an unofficial interpreter without expense

to the United States.

##### (B) Reporters.

Reporters shall record the proceedings and testimony and shall transcribe

them so as to comply with the requirements for the record of trial as prescribed

in these rules.

##### (C) Others.

Other personnel detailed for the assistance of the court-martial

shall have such duties as may be imposed by the military judge.

#### (4) Payment of reporters, interpreters.

The Secretary concerned may prescribe regulations for the payment

of allowances, expenses, per diem, and compensation of reporters and interpreters.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 807 regarding oaths for reporters, interpreters,

and escorts.

### (f) Action upon discovery of disqualification or lack of qualifications.

Any person who discovers that a person detailed to a court-martial

is disqualified or lacks the qualifications specified by this rule shall

cause a report of the matter to be made before the court-martial is first

 in session to the convening authority or, if discovered later, to the military

judge.

## Rule 503. Detailing members, military judge, and counsel

### (a) Members.

#### (1) In general.

 The convening authority shall detail qualified persons as members

for courts-martial.

##### Discussion

The following persons are subject to challenge under R.C.M. 912(f)

and should not be detailed as members: any person who is, in the same case,

an accuser, witness, preliminary hearing officer, or counsel for any party; any

person who, in the case of a new trial, other trial, or rehearing, was a

member of any court-martial which previously heard the case; any person who

is junior to the accused, unless this is unavoidable; an enlisted member from

the same unit as the accused; or any person who is in arrest or confinement.

#### (2) Enlisted members.

An enlisted accused may, before assembly, request orally on the

record or in writing that enlisted persons serve as members of the general

or special court-martial to which that accused's case has been or will be

referred. If such a request is made, an enlisted accused may not be tried

by a court-martial the membership of which does not include enlisted members

in a number comprising at least one-third of the total number of members

unless eligible enlisted members cannot be obtained because of physical conditions

or military exigencies. If the appropriate number of enlisted members cannot

be obtained, the court-martial may be assembled, and the trial may proceed

without them, but the convening authority shall make a detailed written explanation

why enlisted members could not be obtained which must be appended to the record

of trial.

##### Discussion

When such a request is made, the convening authority should:

(1) Detail an appropriate number of enlisted members to the court-martial

and, if appropriate, relieve an appropriate number of commissioned or warrant

officers previously detailed;

(2) Withdraw the charges from the court-martial to which they were originally

 referred and refer them to a court-martial which includes the proper proportion

of enlisted members; or

(3) Advise the court-martial before which the charges are then pending

to proceed in the absence of enlisted members if eligible enlisted members

cannot be detailed because of physical conditions or military exigencies.

    _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(D)(iii).

#### (3) Members from another command or armed force.

A convening authority may detail as members of general and special

courts-martial persons under that convening authority's command or made available

by their commander, even if those persons are members of an armed force different

from that of the convening authority or accused.

##### Discussion

Concurrence of the proper commander may be oral and need not be

shown by the record of trial.

  Members should ordinarily

be of the same armed force as the accused. When a court-martial composed

of members of different armed forces is selected, at least a majority of the

members should be of the same armed force as the accused unless exigent circumstances

make it impractical to do so without manifest injury to the service.

### (b) Military judge.

#### (1) By whom detailed.

The military judge shall be detailed, in accordance with regulations

of the Secretary concerned, by a person assigned as a military judge and

directly responsible to the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate

General's designee. The authority to detail military judges may be delegated

to persons assigned as military judges. If authority to detail military judges

has been delegated to a military judge, that military judge may detail himself

or herself as military judge for a court-martial.

#### (2) Record of detail.

The order detailing a military judge shall be reduced to writing

and included in the record of trial or announced orally on the record at

the court-martial. The writing or announcement shall indicate by whom the

military judge was detailed. The Secretary concerned may require that the

order be reduced to writing.

#### (3) Military judge from a different armed force.

A military judge from one armed force may be detailed to a court-martial

convened in a different armed force, a combatant command or joint command when permitted by the Judge Advocate

General of the armed force of which the military judge is a member. The Judge

Advocate General may delegate authority to make military judges available

for this purpose.

### (c) Counsel.

#### (1) By whom detailed.

Trial and defense counsel, assistant trial and defense counsel,

and associate defense counsel shall be detailed in accordance with regulations

of the Secretary concerned. If authority to detail counsel has been delegated

to a person, that person may detail himself or herself as counsel for a court-martial.

#### (2) Record of detail.

The order detailing a counsel shall be reduced to writing and included

in the record of trial or announced orally on the record at the court-martial.

The writing or announcement shall indicate by whom the counsel was detailed.

The Secretary concerned may require that the order be reduced to writing.

#### (3) Counsel from a different armed force.

A person from one armed force may be detailed to serve as counsel

in a court-martial in a different armed force, a combatant command or joint command when permitted by the Judge Advocate General of the armed force of which the counsel is a member. The

Judge Advocate General may delegate authority to make persons available for

this purpose.

## Rule 504. Convening courts-martial

### (a) In general.

A court-martial is created by a convening order of the convening

authority.

### (b) Who may convene courts-martial.

#### (1) General courts-martial.

Unless otherwise limited by superior competent authority, general

courts-martial may be convened by persons occupying positions designated

in Article 22(a) and by any commander designated by the Secretary concerned

 or empowered by the President.

##### Discussion

The authority to convene courts-martial is independent of rank and

is retained as long as the convening authority remains a commander in one

of the designated positions. The rule by which command devolves are found

in regulations of the Secretary concerned.

#### (2) Special courts-martial.

Unless otherwise limited by superior competent authority, special

courts-martial may be convened by persons occupying positions designated

in Article 23(a) and by commanders designated by the Secretary concerned.

##### Discussion

_See_ the discussion of subsection (b)(1) of this

rule. Persons authorized to convene general courts-martial may also convene

special courts-martial.

##### (A) Definition.

For purposes of Articles 23 and 24, a command or unit is "separate

or detached" when isolated or removed from the immediate disciplinary

control of a superior in such manner as to make its commander the person held

 by superior commanders primarily responsible for discipline. "Separate

or detached" is used in a disciplinary sense and not necessarily in

a tactical or physical sense. A subordinate joint command or joint task force is ordinarily considered to be "separate or detached."

###### Discussion

The power of a commander of a separate or detached unit to convene

courts-martial, like that of any other commander, may be limited by superior

competent authority.

##### (B) Determination.

If a commander is in doubt whether the command is separate or detached,

the matter shall be determined:

(i) In the Army or the Air Force, by the officer exercising general

court-martial jurisdiction over the command; or

(ii) In the Naval Service or Coast Guard, by the flag or general officer

in command or the senior officer present who designated the detachment; or

(iii) In a combatant command or joint command, by the officer exercising general

court-martial jurisdiction over the command.

#### (3) Summary courts-martial.

_See_ R.C.M. 1302(a).

##### Discussion

_See_ the discussion under subsection (b)(1) of this

 rule.

#### (4) Delegation prohibited.

The power to convene courts-martial may not be delegated.

### (c) Disqualification.

#### (1) Accuser.

An accuser may not convene a general or special court-martial for

the trial of the person accused.

##### Discussion

_See also_ Article 1(9); 307(a); 601(c). However, _

 see_ R.C.M. 1302(b) (accuser may convene a summary court-martial).

#### (2) Other.

A convening authority junior in rank to an accuser may not convene

a general or special court-martial for the trial of the accused unless that

convening authority is superior in command to the accuser. A convening authority

junior in command to an accuser may not convene a general or special court-martial

 for the trial of the accused.

#### (3) Action when disqualified.

When a commander who would otherwise convene a general or special

court-martial is disqualified in a case, the charges shall be forwarded to

a superior competent authority for disposition. That authority may personally

dispose of the charges or forward the charges to another convening authority

who is superior in rank to the accuser, or, if in the same chain of command,

who is superior in command to the accuser.

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 401(c).

### (d) Convening orders.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

A convening order for a general or special court-martial shall designate

the type of court-martial and detail the members and may designate where

the court-martial will meet. If the convening authority has been designated

by the Secretary concerned, the convening order shall so state.

##### Discussion

_See_ Appendix 6 for a suggested format for a convening

order.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

A convening order for a summary court-martial shall designate that

it is a summary court-martial and detail the summary court-martial, and may

designate where the court-martial will meet. If the convening authority has

been designated by the Secretary concerned, the convening order shall so state.

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 1302(c).

#### (3) Additional matters.

Additional matters to be included in convening orders may be prescribed

by the Secretary concerned.

### (e) Place.

The convening authority shall ensure that an appropriate location

and facilities for courts-martial are provided.

## Rule 505. Changes of members, military judge, and counsel

### (a) In general.

Subject to this rule, the members, military judge, and counsel may

be changed by an authority competent to detail such persons. Members also

may be excused as provided in subsections (c)(1)(B)(ii) and (c)(2)(A) of

this rule.

#### Discussion

Changes of the members of the court-martial should be kept to a

minimum. If extensive changes are necessary and no session of the court-martial

has begun, it may be appropriate to withdraw the charges from one court-martial

and refer them to another. _See_ R.C.M. 604.

### (b) Procedure.

When new persons are added as members or counsel or when substitutions

are made as to any members or counsel or the military judge, such persons

shall be detailed in accordance with R.C.M. 503. An order changing the members

of the court-martial, except one which excuses members without replacement,

shall be reduced to writing before authentication of the record of trial.

#### Discussion

When members or counsel have been excused and the excusal is not

reduced to writing, the excusal should be announced on the record. A member

who has been temporarily excused need not be formally reappointed to the

court-martial.

### (c) Changes of members.

#### (1) Before assembly.

##### (A) By convening authority.

Before the court-martial is assembled, the convening authority may

change the members of the court-martial without showing cause.

##### (B) By convening authority's delegate.

###### (i) Delegation.

The convening authority may delegate, under regulations of the Secretary

concerned, authority to excuse individual members to the staff judge advocate

or legal officer or other principal assistant to the convening authority.

###### (ii) Limitations.

Before the court-martial is assembled, the convening authority's

delegate may excuse members without cause shown; however, no more than one-third

of the total number of members detailed by the convening authority may be

 excused by the convening authority's delegate in any one court-martial. After

assembly the convening authority's delegate may not excuse members.

#### (2) After assembly.

##### (A) Excusal.

After assembly no member may be excused, except:

(i) By the convening authority for good cause shown on the record;

(ii) By the military judge for good cause shown on the record; or

(iii) As a result of challenge under R.C.M. 912.

##### (B) New members.

New members may be detailed after assembly only when, as a result

of excusals under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this rule, the number of members

of the court-martial is reduced below a quorum, or the number of enlisted

members, when the accused has made a timely written request for enlisted

members, is reduced below one-third of the total membership.

### (d) Changes of detailed counsel.

#### (1) Trial counsel.

An authority competent to detail trial counsel may change the trial

counsel and any assistant trial counsel at any time without showing cause.

#### (2) Defense counsel.

##### (A)  Before formation of attorney-client relationship.

Before an attorney-client relationship has been formed between the

accused and detailed defense counsel or associate or assistant defense counsel,

an authority competent to detail defense counsel may excuse or change such

 counsel without showing cause.

##### (B) After formation of attorney-client relationship.

After an attorney-client relationship has been formed between the

accused and detailed defense counsel or associate or assistant defense counsel,

an authority competent to detail such counsel may excuse or change such counsel

only:

(i) Under R.C.M. 506(b)(3);

(ii) Upon request of the accused or application for withdrawal by such

counsel under R.C.M. 506(c); or

(iii) For other good cause shown on the record.

### (e) Change of military judge.

#### (1) Before assembly.

Before the court-martial is assembled, the military judge may be

changed by an authority competent to detail the military judge, without cause

shown on the record.

#### (2) After assembly.

After the court-martial is assembled, the military judge may be

changed by an authority competent to detail the military judge only when,

as a result of disqualification under R.C.M. 902 or for good cause shown,

the previously detailed military judge is unable to proceed.

### (f) Good cause.

For purposes of this rule, "good cause" includes physical

disability, military exigency, and other extraordinary circumstances which

render the member, counsel, or military judge unable to proceed with the

court-martial within a reasonable time. "Good cause" does not

include temporary inconveniences which are incident to normal conditions

of military life.

## Rule 506. Accused's rights to counsel

### (a) In general.

The accused has the right to be represented before a general or

special court-martial by civilian counsel if provided at no expense to the

Government, and either by the military counsel detailed under Article 27

or military counsel of the accused's own selection, if reasonably available.

The accused is not entitled to be represented by more than one military counsel.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 502(d)(3) as to qualifications of civilian

counsel or individual military counsel.

### (b) Individual military counsel.

#### (1) Reasonably available.

Subject to this subsection, the Secretary concerned shall define

"reasonably available." While so assigned, the following persons

are not reasonably available to serve as individual military counsel because

of the nature of their duties or positions:

(A) A general or flag officer;

(B) A trial or appellate military judge;

(C) A trial counsel;

(D) An appellate defense or government counsel;

(E) A principal legal advisor to a command, organization, or agency

and, when such command, organization, or agency has general court-martial

jurisdiction, the principal assistant of such an advisor;

(F) An instructor or student at a service school or academy:

(G) A student at a college or university;

(H) A member of the staff of the Judge Advocate General of the Army,

Navy, or Air Force, the Chief Counsel of the Coast Guard, or the Director,

Judge Advocate Division, Headquarters, Marine Corps.

 The Secretary

concerned may determine other persons to be not reasonably available because

of the nature or responsibilities of their assignments, geographic considerations,

exigent circumstances, or military necessity. A person who is a member of

an armed force different from that of which the accused is a member shall

be reasonably available to serve as individual military counsel for such accused

to the same extent as that person is available to serve as individual military

counsel for an accused in the same armed force as the person requested. The

Secretary concerned may prescribe circumstances under which exceptions may

 be made to the prohibitions in this subsection when merited by the existence

of an attorney-client relationship regarding matters relating to a charge

in question. However, if the attorney-client relationship arose solely because

the counsel represented the accused on review under Article 70, this exception

shall not apply.

#### (2) Procedure.

Subject to this subsection, the Secretary concerned shall prescribe

procedures for determining whether a requested person is "reasonably

available" to act as individual military counsel. Requests for an individual

military counsel shall be made by the accused or the detailed defense counsel

through the trial counsel to the convening authority. If the requested person

is among those not reasonably available under subsection (b)(1) of this rule

or under regulations of the Secretary concerned, the convening authority shall

deny the request and notify the accused, unless the accused asserts that

there is an existing attorney-client relationship regarding a charge in question

or that the person requested will not, at the time of the trial or investigation

for which requested, be among those so listed as not reasonably available.

If the accused's request makes such a claim, or if the person is not among

those so listed as not reasonably available, the convening authority shall

forward the request to the commander or head of the organization, activity,

or agency to which the requested person is assigned. That authority shall

make an administrative determination whether the requested person is reasonably

available in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

This determination is a matter within the sole discretion of that authority.

An adverse determination may be reviewed upon request of the accused through

that authority to the next higher commander or level of supervision, but

no administrative review may be made which requires action at the departmental

or higher level.

#### (3) Excusal of detailed counsel.

If the accused is represented by individual military counsel, detailed

defense counsel shall normally be excused. The authority who detailed the

defense counsel, as a matter of discretion, may approve a request from the

accused that detailed defense counsel shall act as associate counsel. The

action of the authority who detailed the counsel is subject to review only

for abuse of discretion.

##### Discussion

A request under subsection (b)(3) should be considered in light

of the general statutory policy that the accused is not entitled to be represented

by more than one military counsel. Among the factors that may be considered

 in the exercise of discretion are the seriousness of the case, retention

of civilian defense counsel, complexity of legal or factual issues, and the

detail of additional trial counsel.

  _See_ R.C.M.

905(b)(6) and 906(b)(2) as to motions concerning denial of a request for

individual military counsel or retention of detailed counsel as associate

counsel.

### (c) Excusal or withdrawal.

Except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 505(d)(2) and subsection

(b)(3) of this rule, defense counsel may be excused only with the express

consent of the accused, or by the military judge upon application for withdrawal

 by the defense counsel for good cause shown.

### (d) Waiver.

The accused may expressly waive the right to be represented by counsel

and may thereafter conduct the defense personally. Such waiver shall be accepted

by the military judge only if the military judge finds that the accused is

competent to understand the disadvantages of self-representation and that

the waiver is voluntary and understanding. The military judge may require

that a defense counsel remain present even if the accused waives counsel

and conducts the defense personally. The right of the accused to conduct the

defense personally may be revoked if the accused is disruptive or fails to

follow basic rules of decorum and procedure.

### (e) Nonlawyer present.

Subject to the discretion of the military judge, the accused may

have present and seated at the counsel table for purpose of consultation

persons not qualified to serve as counsel under R.C.M. 502.

#### Discussion

_See_ also Mil. R. Evid. 615 if the person is a potential

witness in the case.

# CHAPTER VI. REFERRAL, SERVICE, AMENDMENT, AND WITHDRAWAL OF CHARGES

## Rule 601. Referral

### (a) In general.

Referral is the order of a convening authority that charges against

an accused will be tried by a specified court-martial.

#### Discussion

Referral of charges requires three elements: a convening authority

who is authorized to convene the court-martial and is not disqualified

(_see_ R.C.M. 601(b) and (c)); preferred charges which have been received

by the convening authority for disposition (_see_ R.C.M. 307

as to preferral of charges and Chapter IV as to disposition); and a court-martial

convened by that convening authority or a predecessor (_see_ R.C.M.

504).

  If trial would be warranted but would be detrimental

to the prosecution of a war or inimical to national security, _see

_ R.C.M. 401(d) and 407(b).

### (b) Who may refer.

Any convening authority may refer charges to a court-martial convened

by that convening authority or a predecessor, unless the power to do so has

been withheld by superior competent authority.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 306(a), 403, 404, 407, and 504.

  The

convening authority may be of any command, including a command different from

that of the accused, but as a practical matter the accused must be subject

to the orders of the convening authority or otherwise under the convening

authority's control to assure the appearance of the accused at trial. The

 convening authority's power over the accused may be based upon agreements

between the commanders concerned.

### (c) Disqualification.

An accuser may not refer charges to a general or special court-martial.

#### Discussion

Convening authorities are not disqualified from referring charges

by prior participation in the same case except when they have acted as accuser.

For a definition of "accuser," _see_ Article 1(9).

 A convening authority who is disqualified may forward the charges and allied

papers for disposition by competent authority superior in rank or command. _

See_ R.C.M. 401(c) concerning actions which the superior may take.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1302 for rules relating to convening summary courts-martial.

### (d) When charges may be referred.

#### (1) Basis for referral.

If the convening authority finds or is advised by a judge advocate

 that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offense triable by a

court-martial has been committed and that the accused committed it, and that

the specification alleges an offense, the convening authority may refer it.

The finding may be based on hearsay in whole or in part. The convening authority

or judge advocate may consider information from any source and shall not

be limited to the information reviewed by any previous authority, but a case

may not be referred to a general court-martial except in compliance with

subsection (d)(2) of this rule. The convening authority or judge advocate

shall not be required before charges are referred to resolve legal issues,

including objections to evidence, which may arise at trial.

##### Discussion

For a discussion of selection among alternative dispositions, _

see_ R.C.M. 306. The convening authority is not obliged to refer all

 charges which the evidence might support. The convening authority should

consider the options and considerations under R.C.M. 306 in exercising the

discretion to refer.

#### (2) General courts-martial.

The convening authority may not refer a specification under a charge

 to a general court-martial unless-

(A) There has been substantial compliance with the pretrial investigation

requirements of R.C.M. 405; and

(B) The convening authority has received the advice of the staff judge

advocate required under R.C.M. 406. These requirements may be waived by the

accused.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(C) concerning limitations

on referral of capital offenses to special courts-martial. _See_ R.C.M.

103(3) for the definition of a capital offense.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1301(c) concerning limitations on the referral of certain

cases to summary courts-martial.

### (e) How charges shall be referred.

#### (1) Order, instructions.

Referral shall be by the personal order of the convening authority.

The convening authority may include proper instructions in the order.

##### Discussion

Referral is ordinarily evidenced by an indorsement on the charge

sheet. Although the indorsement should be completed on all copies of the

charge sheet, only the original must be signed. The signature may be that

of a person acting by the order or direction of the convening authority. In

such a case the signature element must reflect the signer's authority.

  If,

for any reason, charges are referred to a court-martial different from that

to which they were originally referred, the new referral is ordinarily made

by a new indorsement attached to the original charge sheet. The previous

indorsement should be lined out and initialed by the person signing the new

referral. The original indorsement should not be obliterated. _See

also_ R.C.M. 604.

  If the only officer present in

a command refers the charges to a summary court-martial and serves as the

summary court-martial under R.C.M. 1302, the indorsement should be completed

with the additional comments, "only officer present in the command."

  The

convening authority may instruct that the charges against the accused be tried

with certain other charges against the accused. _See_ subsection

(2) below.

  The convening authority may instruct that charges

against one accused be referred for joint or common trial with another accused. _

See_ subsection (3) below.

  The convening authority shall indicate that the case is to be tried as a capital case by including a special instruction in the referral block of the charge sheet.  Failure to include this special instruction at the time of the referral shall not bar the convening authority from later adding the required special instruction, provided that the convening authority has otherwise complied with the applicable notice requirements.  If the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure to include the special instruction, a continuance or a recess is an adequate remedy.

  The convening authority should acknowledge

by an instruction that a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than

six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged

when the prerequisites under Article 19 will not be met. _See_ R.C.M.

201(f)(2)(B)(ii). For example, this instruction may be given when a court

reporter is not detailed.

  Any special instructions must

be stated in the referral indorsement.

  When the charges

have been referred to a court-martial, the indorsed charge sheet and allied

 papers should be promptly transmitted to the trial counsel.

#### (2) Joinder of offenses.

In the discretion of the convening authority, two or more offenses

charged against an accused may be referred to the same court-martial for

trial, whether serious or minor offenses or both, regardless whether related.

Additional charges may be joined with other charges for a single trial at

any time before arraignment if all necessary procedural requirements concerning

the additional charges have been complied with. After arraignment of the

accused upon charges, no additional charges may be referred to the same trial

without consent of the accused.

##### Discussion

Ordinarily all known charges should be referred to a single court-martial.

#### (3) Joinder of accused.

Allegations against two or more accused may be referred for joint

trial if the accused are alleged to have participated in the same act or

transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an

offense or offenses. Such accused may be charged in one or more specifications

together or separately, and every accused need not be charged in each specification.

Related allegations against two or more accused which may be proved by substantially

the same evidence may be referred to a common trial.

##### Discussion

A joint offense is one committed by two or more persons acting together

with a common intent. Joint offenses may be referred for joint trial, along

with all related offenses against each of the accused. A common trial may

be used when the evidence of several offenses committed by several accused

separately is essentially the same, even though the offenses were not jointly

committed. _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5) Discussion. Convening authorities

should consider that joint and common trials may be complicated by procedural

and evidentiary rules.

### (f) Superior convening authorities.

Except as otherwise provided in these rules, a superior competent

authority may cause charges, whether or not referred, to be transmitted to

the authority for further consideration, including, if appropriate, referral.

### (g) Parallel convening authorities.

If it is impracticable for the original convening authority to continue exercising authority over the charges, the convening authority may cause the charges, even if referred, to be transmitted to a parallel convening authority. This transmittal must be in writing and in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe. Subsequent actions taken by the parallel convening authority are within the sole discretion of that convening authority.

#### Discussion

 Parallel convening authorities are those convening authorities that possess the same court-martial jurisdiction authority. Examples of permissible transmittal of charges under this rule include the transmittal from a general court-martial convening authority to another general court-martial convening authority, or from one special court-martial convening authority to another special court-martial convening authority. It would be impracticable for an original convening authority to continue exercising authority over the charges, for example, when a command is being decommissioned or inactivated, or when deploying or redeploying and the accused is remaining behind. If charges have been referred, there is no requirement that the charges be withdrawn or dismissed prior to transfer. _See_ R.C.M. 604. In the event that the case has been referred, the receiving convening authority may adopt the original court-martial convening order, including the court-martial panel selected to hear the case as indicated in that convening order. When charges are transmitted under this rule, no recommendation as to disposition may be made.

## Rule 602. Service of charges

The trial counsel detailed to the court-martial to which charges

have been referred for trial shall cause to be served upon each accused a

copy of the charge sheet. In time of peace, no person may, over objection,

be brought to trial-including an Article 39(a) session-before

a general court-martial within a period of five days after service of charges,

or before a special court-martial within a period of three days after service

of charges. In computing these periods, the date of service of charges and

the date of trial are excluded; holidays and Sundays are included.

### Discussion

Trial counsel should comply with this rule immediately upon receipt

of the charges. Whenever after service the charges are amended or changed

the trial counsel must give notice of the changes to the defense counsel.

Whenever such amendments or changes add a new party, a new offense, or substantially

new allegations, the charge sheet so amended or changed must be served anew. _

See also_ R.C.M. 603.

  Service may be made only upon

the accused; substitute service upon defense counsel is insufficient. The

trial counsel should promptly inform the defense counsel when charges have

been served.

  If the accused has questions when served with

charges, the accused should be told to discuss the matter with defense counsel.

## Rule 603. Changes to charges and specifications

### (a) Minor changes defined.

Minor changes in charges and specifications are any except those

which add a party, offenses, or substantial matter not fairly included in

those previously preferred, or which are likely to mislead the accused as

to the offenses charged.

#### Discussion

Minor changes include those necessary to correct inartfully drafted

or redundant specifications; to correct a misnaming of the accused; to allege

the proper article; or to correct other slight errors. Minor charges also

include those which reduce the seriousness of an offense, as when the value

of an allegedly stolen item in a larceny specification is reduced, or when

a desertion specification is amended to allege only unauthorized absence.

### (b) Minor changes before arraignment.

Any person forwarding, acting upon, or prosecuting charges on behalf

of the United States except a preliminary hearing officer appointed under R.C.M.

405 may make minor changes to charges or specifications before arraignment.

#### Discussion

Charges forwarded or referred for trial should be free from defects

of form and substance. Minor errors may be corrected and the charge may be

redrafted without being sworn anew by the accuser. Other changes should be

signed and sworn to by an accuser. All changes in the charges should be initialed

by the person who makes them. A trial counsel acting under this provision

ordinarily should consult with the convening authority before making any changes

 which, even though minor, change the nature or seriousness of the offense.

### (c) Minor changes after arraignment.

After arraignment the military judge may, upon motion, permit minor

changes in the charges and specifications at any time before findings are

announced if no substantial right of the accused is prejudiced.

### (d) Major changes.

Changes or amendments to charges or specifications other than minor

changes may not be made over the objection of the accused unless the charge

or specification affected is preferred anew.

#### Discussion

If there has been a major change or amendment over the accused's

objection to a charge already referred, a new referral is necessary. Similarly,

in the case of a general court-martial, a new investigation under R.C.M.

405 will be necessary if the charge as amended or changed was not covered

in the prior investigation. If the substance of the charge or specification

as amended or changed has not been referred or, in the case of a general

court-martial, investigated, a new referral and, if appropriate, investigation

are necessary. When charges are re-referred, they must be served anew under

R.C.M. 602.

## Rule 604. Withdrawal of charges

### (a) Withdrawal.

The convening authority or a superior competent authority may for

any reason cause any charges or specifications to be withdrawn from a court-martial

at any time before findings are announced.

#### Discussion

Charges which are withdrawn from a court-martial should be dismissed

(_see_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1)) unless it is intended to refer them

anew promptly or to forward them to another authority for disposition.

  Charges

should not be withdrawn from a court-martial arbitrarily or unfairly to an

accused. _See also_ subsection (b) of this rule.

  Some

or all charges and specifications may be withdrawn. In a joint or common trial

the withdrawal may be limited to charges against one or some of the accused.

  Charges

which have been properly referred to a court-martial may be withdrawn only

by the direction of the convening authority or a superior competent authority

in the exercise of that officer's independent judgment. When directed to

do so by the convening authority or a superior competent authority, trial

counsel may withdraw charges or specifications by lining out the affected

charges or specifications, renumbering remaining charges or specifications

as necessary, and initialing the changes. Charges and specifications withdrawn

before commencement of trial will not be brought to the attention of the

members. When charges or specifications are withdrawn after they have come

to the attention of the members, the military judge must instruct them that

the withdrawn charges or specifications may not be considered for any reason.

### (b) Referral of withdrawn charges.

Charges which have been withdrawn from a court-martial may be referred

to another court-martial unless the withdrawal was for an improper reason.

Charges withdrawn after the introduction of evidence on the general issue

 of guilt may be referred to another court-martial only if the withdrawal

was necessitated by urgent and unforeseen military necessity.

#### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 915 (Mistrial).

  When

charges which have been withdrawn from a court-martial are referred to another

court-martial, the reasons for the withdrawal and later referral should be

included in the record of the later court-martial, if the later referral

is more onerous to the accused. Therefore, if further prosecution is contemplated

at the time of the withdrawal, the reasons for the withdrawal should be included

in or attached to the record of the earlier proceeding.

  Improper

reasons for withdrawal include an intent to interfere with the free exercise

by the accused of constitutional rights or rights provided under the code, or with the impartiality

of a court-martial. A withdrawal is improper if it was not directed personally

and independently by the convening authority or by a superior competent authority.

  Whether

the reason for a withdrawal is proper, for purposes of the propriety of a

later referral, depends in part on the stage in the proceedings at which

the withdrawal takes place. Before arraignment, there are many reasons for

a withdrawal which will not preclude another referral. These include receipt

 of additional charges, absence of the accused, reconsideration by the convening

authority or by a superior competent authority of the seriousness of the

offenses, questions concerning the mental capacity of the accused, and routine

duty rotation of the personnel constituting the court-martial. Charges withdrawn

after arraignment may be referred to another court-martial under some circumstances.

For example, it is permissible to refer charges which were withdrawn pursuant

to a pretrial agreement if the accused fails to fulfill the terms of the

agreement. _See_ R.C.M. 705. Charges withdrawn after some evidence

on the general issue of guilty is introduced may be re-referred only under

the narrow circumstances described in the rule.

# CHAPTER VII. PRETRIAL MATTERS

## Rule 701. Discovery

### (a) Disclosure by the trial counsel.

Except as otherwise provided in subsections (f) and (g)(2) of this

rule, the trial counsel shall provide the following information or matters

to the defense-

#### (1) Papers accompanying charges; convening orders; statements.

As soon as practicable after service of charges under R.C.M. 602,

the trial counsel shall provide the defense with copies of, or, if extraordinary

circumstances make it impracticable to provide copies, permit the defense

to inspect:

(A) Any paper which accompanied the charges when they were referred

to the court-martial, including papers sent with charges upon a rehearing

or new trial;

(B) The convening order and any amending orders; and

(C) Any sworn or signed statement relating to an offense charged in

the case which is in the possession of the trial counsel.

#### (2) Documents, tangible objects, reports.

After service of charges, upon request of the defense, the Government

shall permit the defense to inspect:

(A) Any books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, buildings,

or places, or copies of portions thereof, which are within the possession,

custody, or control of military authorities, and which are material to the

preparation of the defense or are intended for use by the trial counsel as

evidence in the prosecution case-in-chief at trial, or were obtained from

or belong to the accused; and

(B) Any results or reports of physical or mental examinations, and of

scientific tests or experiments, or copies thereof, which are within the

possession, custody, or control of military authorities, the existence of

which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the

trial counsel, and which are material to the preparation of the defense or

are intended for use by the trial counsel as evidence in the prosecution

case-in-chief at trial.

###### Discussion

For specific rules concerning certain mental examinations of the

accused or third party patients, _see_ R.C.M. 701(f), R.C.M.

706, Mil. R. Evid. 302 and Mil. R. Evid. 513.

#### (3) Witnesses.

Before the beginning of trial on the merits the trial counsel shall

notify the defense of the names and addresses of the witnesses the trial

counsel intends to call:

(A) In the prosecution case-in-chief; and

(B) To rebut a defense of alibi, innocent ingestion, or lack of mental

responsibility, when trial counsel has received timely notice under subsection

(b)(1) or (2) of this rule.

###### Discussion

Such notice should be in writing except when impracticable.

#### (4) Prior convictions of accused offered on the merits.

Before arraignment the trial counsel shall notify the defense of

any records of prior civilian or court-martial convictions of the accused

of which the trial counsel is aware and which the trial counsel may offer

on the merits for any purpose, including impeachment, and shall permit the

defense to inspect such records when they are in the trial counsel's possession.

#### (5) Information to be offered at sentencing.

Upon request of the defense the trial counsel shall:

(A) Permit the defense to inspect such written material as will be

presented by the prosecution at the presentencing proceedings; and

(B) Notify the defense of the names and addresses of the witnesses the

 trial counsel intends to call at the presentencing proceedings under R.C.M.

1001(b).

#### (6) Evidence favorable to the defense.

The trial counsel shall, as soon as practicable, disclose to the

 defense the existence of evidence known to the trial counsel which reasonably

tends to:

(A) Negate the guilt of the accused of an offense charged;

(B) Reduce the degree of guilt of the accused of an offense charged;

or

(C) Reduce the punishment.

###### Discussion

In addition to the matters required to be disclosed under subsection

(a) of this rule, the Government is required to notify the defense of or

provide to the defense certain information under other rules. Mil. R. Evid.

506 covers the disclosure of unclassified information which is under the control

 of the Government. Mil. R. Evid. 505 covers disclosure of classified information.

  Other

R.C.M. and Mil. R. Evid. concern disclosure of other specific matters. _

See_ R.C.M. 308 (identification of accuser), 405 (report of Article 32 preliminary hearing), 706(c)(3)(B) (mental examination of accused), 914 (production

of certain statements), and 1004(b)(1) (aggravating circumstances in capital

cases); Mil. R. Evid. 301(c)(2) (notice of immunity or leniency to witnesses),

302 (mental examination of accused), 304(d)(1) (statements by accused), 311(d)(1)

(evidence seized from accused), 321(c)(1) (evidence based on lineups), 507

(identity of informants), 612 (memoranda used to refresh recollection), and

613(a) (prior inconsistent statements).

  Requirements for

notice of intent to use certain evidence are found in: Mil. R. Evid. 201A(b)

(judicial notice of foreign law), 301(c)(2) (immunized witnesses), 304(d)(2)

(notice of intent to use undisclosed confessions), 304(f) (testimony of accused

for limited purpose on confession), 311(d)(2)(B) (notice of intent to use

undisclosed evidence seized), 311(f) (testimony of accused for limited purpose

on seizures), 321(c)(2)(B) (notice of intent to use undisclosed line-up evidence),

321(e) (testimony of accused for limited purpose of line-ups), 412(c)(1)

and (2) (intent of defense to use evidence of sexual misconduct by a victim);

505(h) (intent to disclose classified information), 506(h) (intent to disclose

privilege government information), and 609(b) (intent to impeach with conviction

over 10 years old).

### (b) Disclosure by the defense.

Except as otherwise provided in subsections (f) and (g)(2) of this

rule, the defense shall provide the following information to the trial counsel-

#### (1) Names of witnesses and statements.

(A) Before the beginning of trial on the merits, the defense shall notify

the trial counsel of the names and addresses of all witnesses, other than

the accused, whom the defense intends to call during the defense case in

chief, and provide all sworn or signed statements known by the defense to

have been made by such witnesses in connection with the case.

(B) Upon request of the trial counsel, the defense shall also

(i) Provide the trial counsel with the names and addresses of any witnesses

whom the defense intends to call at the presentencing proceedings under R.C.M.

1001(c); and

(ii) Permit the trial counsel to inspect any written material that will

be presented by the defense at the presentencing proceeding.

####### Discussion

Such notice shall be in writing except when impracticable. _

See_ R.C.M. 701(f) for statements that would not be subject to disclosure.

#### (2) Notice of certain defenses.

The defense shall notify the trial counsel before the beginning

of trial on the merits of its intent to offer the defense of alibi, innocent

ingestion, or lack of mental responsibility, or its intent to introduce expert

testimony as to the accused's mental condition. Such notice by the defense

shall disclose, in the case of an alibi defense, the place or places at which

the defense claims the accused to have been at the time of the alleged offense,

and, in the case of an innocent ingestion defense, the place or places where,

and the circumstances under which the defense claims the accused innocently

ingested the substance in question, and the names and addresses of the witnesses

upon whom the accused intends to rely to establish any such defenses.

##### Discussion

Such notice should be in writing except when impracticable. _

See_ R.C.M. 916(k) concerning the defense of lack of mental responsibility. _

See_ R.C.M. 706 concerning inquiries into the mental responsibility

of the accused. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 302 concerning statements

by the accused during such inquiries. If the defense needs more detail as

to the time, date, or place of the offense to comply with this rule, it should

request a bill of particulars. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(6).

#### (3) Documents and tangible objects.

If the defense requests disclosure under subsection (a)(2)(A) of

this rule, upon compliance with such request by the Government, the defense,

on request of the trial counsel, shall permit the trial counsel to inspect

 books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, or copies or portions

thereof, which are within the possession, custody, or control of the defense

and which the defense intends to introduce as evidence in the defense case-in-chief

at trial.

#### (4) Reports of examination and tests.

If the defense requests disclosure under subsection (a)(2)(B) of

this rule, upon compliance with such request by the Government, the defense,

on request of trial counsel, shall (except as provided in R.C.M. 706, Mil.

R. Evid. 302, and Mil. R. Evid. 513) permit the trial counsel to inspect

any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific

tests or experiments made in connection with the particular case, or copies

thereof, that are within the possession, custody, or control of the defense

that the defense intends to introduce as evidence in the defense case-in-chief

at trial or that were prepared by a witness whom the defense intends to call

at trial when the results or reports relate to that witness' testimony.

#### (5) Inadmissibility of withdrawn defense.

If an intention to rely upon a defense under subsection (b)(2) of

this rule is withdrawn, evidence of such intention and disclosures by the

accused or defense counsel made in connection with such intention is not,

in any court-martial, admissible against the accused who gave notice of the

intention.

##### Discussion

In addition to the matters covered in subsection (b) of this rule,

defense counsel is required to give notice or disclose evidence under certain

Military Rules of Evidence: Mil. R. Evid. 201A(b) (judicial notice of foreign

law), 304(f) (testimony by the accused for a limited purpose in relation to

 a confession), 311(b) (same, search), 321(e) (same, lineup), 412(c)(1) and

(2) (intent to offer evidence of sexual misconduct by a victim), 505(h) (intent

to disclose classified information), 506(h) (intent to disclose privileged

government information), 609(b) (intent to impeach a witness with a conviction

older than 10 years), 612(2) (writing used to refresh recollection), and

613(a) (prior inconsistent statements).

### (c) Failure to call witness.

The fact that a witness' name is on a list of expected or intended

witnesses provided to an opposing party, whether required by this rule or

not, shall not be ground for comment upon a failure to call the witness.

### (d) Continuing duty to disclose.

If, before or during the court-martial, a party discovers additional

evidence or material previously requested or required to be produced, which

is subject to discovery or inspection under this rule, that party shall promptly

notify the other party or the military judge of the existence of the additional

evidence or material.

### (e) Access to witnesses and evidence.

Each party shall have adequate opportunity to prepare its case and equal opportunity to interview witnesses and inspect evidence, subject to the limitations in subsection (e)(1) of this rule. No party may unreasonably impede the access of another party to a witness or evidence.

#### (1) Counsel for the Accused Interview of Victim of Alleged Sex-Related Offense.

(A) Upon notice by counsel for the government to counsel for the accused of the name of an alleged victim of a sex-related offense whom counsel for the government intends to call to testify at a court-martial, counsel for the accused, or that lawyer's representative, as defined in Mil. R. Evid. 502(b)(3), shall make any request to interview that victim through special victims' counsel or other counsel for the victim, if applicable.

(B) If requested by an alleged victim of a sex-related offense who is subject to a request for interview under subsection (e)(1)(A) of this rule, any interview of the victim by counsel for the accused, or that lawyer's representative, as defined in Mil. R. Evid. 502(b)(3), shall take place only in the presence of counsel for the government, counsel for the victim, or a sexual assault victim advocate.

(C) In this subsection, the term "sex-related offense" means-

(i) a violation of Article 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, or 125; or

(ii) an attempt to commit an offense specified in subsection (e)(1)(C)(i) of this rule under Article 80.

####### Discussion

Convening authorities, commanders and members of their immediate

staffs should make no statement, oral or written, and take no action which

could reasonably be understood to discourage or prevent witnesses from testifying

 truthfully before a court-martial, or as a threat of retribution for such

testimony.

 Article 46(b), enacted by section 1704 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, as amended by section 531(b) of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291, 19 December 2014, is implemented by this rule.

 Counsel must remain cognizant of professional responsibility rules regarding communicating with represented persons.

### (f) Information not subject to disclosure.

Nothing in this rule shall be construed to require the disclosure

of information protected from disclosure by the Military Rules of Evidence.

Nothing in this rule shall require the disclosure or production of notes,

memoranda, or similar working papers prepared by counsel and counsel's assistants

and representatives.

### (g) Regulation of discovery.

#### (1) Time, place, and manner.

The military judge may, consistent with this rule, specify the time,

place, and manner of making discovery and may prescribe such terms and conditions

as are just.

#### (2) Protective and modifying orders.

Upon a sufficient showing the military judge may at any time order

that the discovery or inspection be denied, restricted, or deferred, or make

such other order as is appropriate. Upon motion by a party, the military

judge may permit the party to make such showing, in whole or in part, in writing

to be inspected only by the military judge. If the military judge grants

relief after such an ex parte showing, the entire text of the party's statement

shall be sealed and attached to the record of trial as an appellate exhibit.

Such material may be examined by reviewing authorities in closed proceedings

for the purpose of reviewing the determination of the military judge.

#### (3) Failure to comply.

If at any time during the court-martial it is brought to the attention

of the military judge that a party has failed to comply with this rule, the

military judge may take one or more of the following actions:

(A) Order the party to permit discovery;

(B) Grant a continuance;

(C) Prohibit the party from introducing evidence, calling a witness,

or raising a defense not disclosed; and

(D) Enter such other order as is just under the circumstances. This

rule shall not limit the right of the accused to testify in the accused's

behalf.

###### Discussion

Factors to be considered in determining whether to grant an exception

to exclusion under subsection (3)(C) include: the extent of disadvantage

that resulted from a failure to disclose; the reason for the failure to disclose;

the extent to which later events mitigated the disadvantage caused by the

failure to disclose; and any other relevant factors.

  The

sanction of excluding the testimony of a defense witness should be used only

upon finding that the defense counsel's failure to comply with this rule

was willful and motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage or to

conceal a plan to present fabricated testimony. Moreover, the sanction of

excluding the testimony of a defense witness should only be used if alternative

sanctions could not have minimized the prejudice to the Government. Before

imposing this sanction, the military judge must weigh the defendant's right

 to compulsory process against the countervailing public interests, including

(1) the integrity of the adversary process; (2) the interest in the fair

and efficient administration of military justice; and (3) the potential prejudice

to the truth-determining function of the trial process.

  Procedures

governing refusal to disclose classified information are in Mil. R. Evid.

505. Procedures governing refusal to disclose other government information

are in Mil. R. Evid. 506. Procedures governing refusal to disclose an informant's

identity are in Mil. R. Evid. 507.

### (h) Inspect.

As used in this rule "inspect" includes the right to

photograph and copy.

## Rule 702. Depositions

### (a) In general.

A deposition may be ordered whenever, after preferral of charges, due to exceptional circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness be taken and preserved for use at a preliminary hearing under Article 32 or a court-martial. A victim's declination to testify at a preliminary hearing or a victim's declination to submit to pretrial interviews shall not, by themselves, be considered exceptional circumstances. In accordance with subsection (b) of this rule below, the convening authority or military judge may order a deposition of a victim only if it is determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the victim will not be available to testify at court-martial.

#### Discussion

A deposition is the out-of-court testimony of a witness under oath

in response to questions by the parties, which is reduced to writing or recorded

on videotape or audiotape or similar material. A deposition taken on oral

examination is an oral deposition, and a deposition taken on written interrogatories

is a written deposition. Written interrogatories are questions, prepared

by the prosecution, defense, or both, which are reduced to writing before

submission to a witness whose testimony is to be taken by deposition. The

answers, reduced to writing and properly sworn to, constitute the deposition

testimony of the witness.

  Note that under subsection (i)

of this rule a deposition may be taken by agreement of the parties without

necessity of an order.

  A deposition may be taken to preserve

the testimony of a witness who is likely to be unavailable at the investigation

under Article 32 (_see_ R.C.M. 405(g)) or at the time of trial

(_see_ R.C.M. 703(b)). Part of all or a deposition, so far

as otherwise admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence, may be used

on the merits or on an interlocutory question as substantive evidence if the

witness is unavailable under Mil. R. Evid. 804(a) except that a deposition

may be admitted in a capital case only upon offer by the defense. _

See_ Mil. R. Evid. 804(b)(1). In any case, a deposition may be used

by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony

of the deponent as a witness. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 613. If

only a part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse

party may require the proponent to offer all which is relevant to the part

offered, and any party may offer other parts. _See_ Mil. R.

Evid. 106.

  A deposition which is transcribed is ordinarily

read to the court-martial by the party offering it. _See also_ subsection

(g)(3) of this rule. The transcript of a deposition may not be inspected by

the members. Objections may be made to testimony in a written deposition

in the same way that they would be if the testimony were offered through

the personal appearance of a witness.

  Part or all of a deposition

so far as otherwise admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence may be

used in presentencing proceedings as substantive evidence as provided in R.C.M.

1001.

  DD Form 456 (Interrogatories and Deposition) may be

used in conjunction with this rule.

### (b) Who may order.

A convening authority who has the charges for disposition or, after

referral, the convening authority or the military judge may order that a

deposition be taken on request of a party.

### (c) Request to take deposition.

#### (1) Submission of request.

At any time after charges have been preferred, any party may request

in writing that a deposition be taken.

##### Discussion

A copy of the request and any accompanying papers ordinarily should

be served on the other parties when the request is submitted.

#### (2) Contents of request.

A request for a deposition shall include:

(A) The name and address of the person whose deposition is requested, or, if the name of the person is unknown, a description of the office or position of the person;

(B) A statement of the matters on which the person is to be examined; and

(C) Whether an oral or written deposition is requested.

#### (3) Action on request.

(A) Upon receipt of a request for a deposition, the convening authority or military judge shall determine whether the requesting party has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that due to exceptional circumstances and in the interest of justice, the testimony of the prospective witness must be taken and preserved for use at a preliminary hearing under Article 32 or court-martial.

##### (B) Written deposition.

A request for a written deposition may not be approved without the

consent of the opposing party except when the deposition is ordered solely

in lieu of producing a witness for sentencing under R.C.M. 1001 and the authority

ordering the deposition determines that the interests of the parties and the

court-martial can be adequately served by a written deposition.

###### Discussion

A request for an oral deposition may be approved without the consent

 of the opposing party.

##### (C) Notification of decision.

The authority who acts on the request shall promptly inform the

requesting party of the action on the request and, if the request is denied,

the reasons for denial.

##### (D) Waiver.

Failure to review before the military judge a request for a deposition

denied by a convening authority waives further consideration of the request.

### (d) Action when request is approved.

#### (1) Detail of deposition officer.

When a request for a deposition is approved, the convening authority shall detail a judge advocate certified under Art. 27(b) to serve as deposition officer. When the appointment of a judge advocate as deposition officer is not practicable, the convening authority may detail an impartial commissioned officer or appropriate civil officer authorized to administer oaths, not the accuser, to serve as deposition officer. If the deposition officer is not a judge advocate, an impartial judge advocate certified under Art. 27(b) shall be made available to provide legal advice to the deposition officer.

##### Discussion

_See_ Article 49(c).

  When a deposition

will be at a point distant from the command, an appropriate authority may

be requested to make available an officer to serve as deposition officer.

#### (2) Assignment of counsel.

If charges have not yet been referred to a court-martial when a

request to take a deposition is approved, the convening authority who directed

the taking of the deposition shall ensure that counsel qualified as required

under R.C.M. 502(d) are assigned to represent each party.

##### Discussion

The counsel who represents the accused at a deposition ordinarily

will form an attorney-client relationship with the accused which will continue

through a later court-martial. _ See_ R.C.M. 506.

  If

the accused has formed an attorney-client relationship with military counsel

concerning the charges in question, ordinarily that counsel should be appointed

to represent the accused.

#### (3) Instructions.

The convening authority may give instructions not inconsistent with

 this rule to the deposition officer.

##### Discussion

Such instruction may include the time and place for taking the deposition.

### (e) Notice.

The party at whose request a deposition is to be taken shall give

to every other party reasonable written notice of the time and place for

taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined.

On motion of a party upon whom the notice is served the deposition officer

may for cause shown extend or shorten the time or change the place for taking

the deposition, consistent with any instructions from the convening authority.

### (f) Duties of the deposition officer.

In accordance with this rule, and subject to any instructions under

subsection (d)(3) of this rule, the deposition officer shall:

(1) Arrange a time and place for taking the deposition and, in the case

of an oral deposition, notify the party who requested the deposition accordingly;

(2) Arrange for the presence of any witness whose deposition is to be

taken in accordance with the procedures for production of witnesses and evidence

under R.C.M. 703(e);

(3) Maintain order during the deposition and protect the parties and

witnesses from annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression;

(4) Administer the oath to each witness, the reporter, and interpreter,

if any;

(5) In the case of a written deposition, ask the questions submitted

by counsel to the witness;

(6) Cause the proceedings to be recorded so that a verbatim record is

made or may be prepared;

(7) Record, but not rule upon, objections or motions and the testimony

to which they relate;

(8) Authenticate the record of the deposition and forward it to the

authority who ordered the deposition; and

(9) Report to the convening authority any substantial irregularity in

the proceeding.

##### Discussion

When any unusual problem, such as improper conduct by counsel or

a witness, prevents an orderly and fair proceeding, the deposition officer

should adjourn the proceedings and inform the convening authority.

  The

authority who ordered the deposition should forward copies to the parties.

### (g) Procedure.

#### (1) Oral depositions.

##### (A) Rights of accused.

At an oral deposition, the accused shall have the rights to:

(i) Be present except when: _(a)_ the accused, absent

good cause shown, fails to appear after notice of time and place of the deposition; _

(b)_ the accused is disruptive within the meaning of R.C.M. 804(b)(2);

or _(c)_ the deposition is ordered in lieu of production of

a witness on sentencing under R.C.M. 1001 and the authority ordering the

deposition determines that the interests of the parties and the court-martial

can be served adequately by an oral deposition without the presence of the

accused; and

(ii) Be represented by counsel as provided in R.C.M. 506.

##### (B) Examination of witnesses.

Each witness giving an oral deposition shall be examined under oath.

The scope and manner of examination and cross-examination shall be such as

would be allowed in the trial itself. The Government shall make available

 to each accused for examination and use at the taking of the deposition any

statement of the witness which is in the possession of the United States

and to which the accused would be entitled at the trial.

###### Discussion

As to objections, _ see_ subsections (f)(7) and (h)

of this rule. As to production of prior statements of witnesses, _

see_ R.C.M. 914; Mil. R. Evid. 612, 613.

  A sample

oath for a deposition follows.

   "You (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you give

shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you

God)?"

#### (2) Written depositions.

##### (A) Rights of accused.

The accused shall have the right to be represented by counsel as

provided in R.C.M. 506 for the purpose of taking a written deposition, except

when the deposition is taken for use at a summary court-martial.

##### (B) Presence of parties.

No party has a right to be present at a written deposition.

##### (C) Submission of interrogatories to opponent.

The party requesting a written deposition shall submit to opposing

counsel a list of written questions to be asked of the witness. Opposing

counsel may examine the questions and shall be allowed a reasonable time

to prepare cross-interrogatories and objections, if any.

###### Discussion

The interrogatories and cross-interrogatories should be sent to

the deposition officer by the party who requested the deposition. _

See_ subsection (h)(3) of this rule concerning objections.

##### (D) Examination of witnesses.

The deposition officer shall swear the witness, read each question

presented by the parties to the witness, and record each response. The testimony

of the witness shall be recorded on videotape, audiotape, or similar material

or shall be transcribed. When the testimony is transcribed, the deposition

shall, except when impracticable, be submitted to the witness for examination.

The deposition officer may enter additional matters then stated by the witness

under oath. The deposition shall be signed by the witness if the witness

is available. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the deposition

officer shall record the reason. The certificate of authentication shall

then be executed.

#### (3) How recorded.

In the discretion of the authority who ordered the deposition, a

deposition may be recorded by a reporter or by other means including videotape,

audiotape, or sound film. In the discretion of the military judge, depositions

recorded by videotape, audiotape, or sound film may be played for the court-martial

or may be transcribed and read to the court-martial.

##### Discussion

A deposition read in evidence or one that is played during a court-martial,

is recorded and transcribed by the reporter in the same way as any other

testimony. The deposition need not be included in the record of trial.

### (h) Objections.

#### (1) In general.

A failure to object prior to the deposition to the taking of the

deposition on grounds which may be corrected if the objection is made prior

to the deposition waives such objection.

#### (2) Oral depositions.

Objections to questions, testimony, or evidence at an oral deposition

and the grounds for such objection shall be stated at the time of taking

such deposition. If an objection relates to a matter which could have been

 corrected if the objection had been made during the deposition, the objection

is waived if not made at the deposition.

##### Discussion

A party may show that an objection was made during the deposition

but not recorded, but, in the absence of such evidence, the transcript of

the deposition governs.

#### (3) Written depositions.

Objections to any question in written interrogatories shall be served

on the party who proposed the question before the interrogatories are sent

to the deposition officer or the objection is waived. Objections to answers

 in a written deposition may be made at trial.

### (i) Deposition by agreement not precluded.

#### (1) Taking deposition.

Nothing in this rule shall preclude the taking of a deposition without

cost to the United States, orally or upon written questions, by agreement

of the parties.

#### (2) Use of deposition.

Subject to Article 49, nothing in this rule shall preclude the use

of a deposition at the court-martial by agreement of the parties unless the

military judge forbids its use for good cause.

## Rule 703. Production of witnesses and evidence

### (a) In general.

The prosecution and defense and the court-martial shall have equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence, subject to the limitations set forth in R.C.M. 701(e)(1), including the benefit of compulsory process.

#### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 801(c) concerning the opportunity

of the court-martial to obtain witnesses and evidence.

### (b) Right to witnesses.

#### (1) On the merits or on interlocutory questions.

Each party is entitled to the production of any witness whose testimony

on a matter in issue on the merits or on an interlocutory question would

be relevant and necessary. With the consent of both the accused and Government, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify via remote means. Over a party's objection, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify on interlocutory questions via remote means or similar technology if the practical difficulties of producing the witness outweigh the significance of the witness' personal appearance (although such testimony will not be admissible over the accused's objection as evidence on the ultimate issue of guilt). Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to: the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the interlocutory proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; the likelihood of significant interference with military operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-court testimony.

##### Discussion

_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 401 concerning relevance.

  Relevant testimony is necessary when it is not cumulative and when it would contribute

to a party's presentation of the case in some positive way on a matter in

issue. A matter is not in issue when it is stipulated as a fact.

  The procedures for receiving testimony via remote means and the definition thereof are contained in R.C.M. 914B.  An issue may arise as both an interlocutory question and a question that bears on the ultimate issue of guilt.  See R.C.M. 801(e)(5).  In such circumstances, this rule authorizes the admission of testimony by remote means or similar technology over the accused's objection only as evidence on the interlocutory question.  In most instances, testimony taken over a party's objection will not be admissible as evidence on the question that bears on the ultimate issue of guilt; however, there may be certain limited circumstances where the testimony is admissible on the ultimate issue of guilt.  Such determinations must be made based upon the relevant rules of evidence.

#### (2) On sentencing.

Each party is entitled to the production of a witness whose testimony

on sentencing is required under R.C.M. 1001(e).

#### (3) Unavailable witness.

Notwithstanding subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this rule, a party

is not entitled to the presence of a witness who is unavailable within the

meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 804(a). However, if the testimony of a witness who

is unavailable is of such central importance to an issue that it is essential

to a fair trial, and if there is no adequate substitute for such testimony,

the military judge shall grant a continuance or other relief in order to

attempt to secure the witness' presence or shall abate the proceedings, unless

the unavailability of the witness is the fault of or could have been prevented

by the requesting party.

### (c) Determining which witness will be produced.

#### (1) Witnesses for the prosecution.

The trial counsel shall obtain the presence of witnesses whose testimony

the trial counsel considers relevant and necessary for the prosecution.

#### (2) Witnesses for the defense.

##### (A) Request.

The defense shall submit to the trial counsel a written list of

witnesses whose production by the Government the defense requests.

##### (B) Contents of request.

###### (i) Witnesses on merits or interlocutory questions.

A list of witnesses whose testimony the defense considers relevant

and necessary on the merits or on an interlocutory question shall include

the name, telephone number, if known, and address or location of the witness

 such that the witness can be found upon the exercise of due diligence and

a synopsis of the expected testimony sufficient to show its relevance and

necessity.

###### (ii) Witnesses on sentencing.

A list of witnesses wanted for presentencing proceedings shall include

the name, telephone number, if known, and address or location of the witness

such that the witness can be found upon the exercise of due diligence, a

synopsis of the testimony that it is expected the witness will give, and the

reasons why the witness' personal appearance will be necessary under the

standards set forth in R.C.M. 1001(e).

##### (C) Time of request.

A list of witnesses under this subsection shall be submitted in

time reasonably to allow production of each witness on the date when the

witness' presence will be necessary. The military judge may set a specific

date by which such lists must be submitted. Failure to submit the name of

a witness in a timely manner shall permit denial of a motion for production

of the witness, but relief from such denial may be granted for good cause

shown.

##### (D) Determination.

The trial counsel shall arrange for the presence of any witness

 listed by the defense unless the trial counsel contends that the witness'

 production is not required under this rule. If the trial counsel contends

that the witness' production is not required by this rule, the matter may

be submitted to the military judge. If the military judge grants a motion

for a witness, the trial counsel shall produce the witness or the proceedings

shall be abated.

###### Discussion

When significant or unusual costs would be involved in producing

 witnesses, the trial counsel should inform the convening authority, as the

 convening authority may elect to dispose of the matter by means other than

a court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(7). _See also

_ R.C.M. 905(j).

### (d) Employment of expert witnesses.

When the employment at Government expense of an expert is considered

 necessary by a party, the party shall, in advance of employment of the expert,

 and with notice to the opposing party, submit a request to the convening

authority to authorize the employment and to fix the compensation for the

expert. The request shall include a complete statement of reasons why employment

of the expert is necessary and the estimated cost of employment. A request

denied by the convening authority may be renewed before the military judge

who shall determine whether the testimony of the expert is relevant and necessary,

and, if so, whether the Government has provided or will provide an adequate

 substitute. If the military judge grants a motion for employment of an expert

or finds that the Government is required to provide a substitute, the proceedings

shall be abated if the Government fails to comply with the ruling. In the

absence of advance authorization, an expert witness may not be paid fees

other than those to which entitled under subsection (e)(2)(D) of this rule.

#### Discussion

_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 702, 706.

### (e) Procedures for production of witnesses.

#### (1) Military witnesses.

The attendance of a military witness may be obtained by notifying

the commander of the witness of the time, place, and date the witness' presence

is required and requesting the commander to issue any necessary orders to

the witness.

##### Discussion

When military witnesses are located near the court-martial, their

 presence can usually be obtained through informal coordination with them

and their commander. If the witness is not near the court-martial and attendance

would involve travel at government expense, or if informal coordination

is inadequate, the appropriate superior should be requested to issue the

necessary order.

  If practicable, a request for the attendance

of a military witness should be made so that the witness will have at least

48 hours notice before starting to travel to attend the court-martial.

  The

attendance of persons not on active duty should be obtained in the manner

prescribed in subsection (e)(2) of this rule.

#### (2) Civilian witnesses-subpoena.

##### (A) In general.

The presence of witnesses not on active duty may be obtained by

 subpoena.

###### Discussion

A subpoena is not necessary if the witness appears voluntarily at

no expense to the United States.

  Civilian employees of

the Department of Defense may be directed by appropriate authorities to appear

as witnesses in courts-martial as an incident of their employment. Appropriate

travel orders may be issued for this purpose.

  A subpoena

may not be used to compel a civilian to travel outside the United States

and its territories.

  A witness must be subject to United

States jurisdiction to be subject to a subpoena. Foreign nationals in a foreign

country are not subject to subpoena. Their presence may be obtained through

cooperation of the host nation.

##### (B) Contents.

A subpoena shall state the command by which the proceeding is directed, and the title, if any, of the proceeding. A subpoena shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony at the time and place specified therein. A subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information designated therein at the proceeding or at an earlier time for inspection by the parties. A subpoena issued for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 shall not command any person to attend or give testimony at an Article 32 preliminary hearing.

###### Discussion

A subpoena may not be used to compel a witness to appear at an examination or interview before trial, but a subpoena may be used to obtain witnesses for a deposition or a court of inquiry. In accordance with subsection (f)(4)(B) of this rule, a subpoena duces tecum to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information for pretrial investigation pursuant to Article 32 may be issued, following the convening authority's order directing such pretrial investigation, by either the investigating officer appointed under R.C.M. 405(d)(1) or the counsel representing the United States.

  A subpoena normally is prepared, signed, and issued in duplicate on the official forms. _See_ Appendix 7 for an example of a subpoena with certificate of service (DD Form 453) and a Travel Order (DD Form 453-1).

##### (C) Who may issue.

(1) A subpoena to secure evidence may be issued by:

(a) The summary court-martial;

(b) Detailed counsel for the government at an Article 32 preliminary hearing;

(c) After referral to a court-martial, detailed trial counsel;

(d) The president of a court of inquiry; or

(e) An officer detailed to take a deposition.

(2) A subpoena to secure witnesses may be issued by:

(a) the summary court-martial;

(b) after referral to a court-martial, detailed trial counsel;

(c) the president of a court of inquiry; or

(d) an officer detailed to take a deposition.

##### (D) Service.

A subpoena may be served by the person authorized by this rule to issue it, a United States Marshal, or any other person who is not less than 18 years of age. Service shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person named and by providing to the person named travel orders and a means for reimbursement for fees and mileage as may be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, or in the case of hardship resulting in the subpoenaed witness's inability to comply with the subpoena absent initial government payment, by providing to the person named travel orders, fees, and mileage sufficient to comply with the subpoena in rules prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

###### Discussion

If practicable, a subpoena should be issued in time to permit service at least 24 hours before the time the witness will have to travel to comply with the subpoena.

  _Informal service._ Unless formal service is advisable, the person who issued the subpoena may mail it to the witness in duplicate, enclosing a postage-paid envelope bearing a return address, with the request that the witness sign the acceptance of service on the copy and return it in the envelope provided. The return envelope should be addressed to the person who issued the subpoena. The person who issued the subpoena should include with it a statement to the effect that the rights of the witness to fees and mileage will not be impaired by voluntary compliance with the request and that a voucher for fees and mileage will be delivered to the witness promptly on being discharged from attendance.

  _Formal service._ Formal service is advisable whenever it is anticipated that the witness will not comply voluntarily with the subpoena. Appropriate fees and mileage must be paid or tendered. _See_ Article 47. If formal service is advisable, the person who issued the subpoena must assure timely and economical service. That person may do so by serving the subpoena personally when the witness is in the vicinity. When the witness is not in the vicinity, the subpoena may be sent in duplicate to the commander of a military installation near the witness. Such commanders should give prompt and effective assistance, issuing travel orders for their personnel to serve the subpoena when necessary.

  Service should ordinarily be made by a person subject to the code. The duplicate copy of the subpoena must have entered upon it proof of service as indicated on the form and must be promptly returned to the person who issued the subpoena. If service cannot be made, the person who issued the subpoena must be informed promptly. A stamped, addressed envelope should be provided for these purposes.

  For purposes of this Rule, _hardship_ is defined as any situation which would substantially preclude reasonable efforts to appear that could be solved by providing transportation or fees and mileage to which the witness is entitled for appearing at the hearing in question.

##### (E) Place of service.

###### (i) In general.

A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition,

 court-martial, or court of inquiry may be served at any place within the

United States, it Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions.

###### (ii) Foreign territory.

In foreign territory, the attendance of civilian witnesses may be

 obtained in accordance with existing agreements or, in the absence of agreements,

with principles of international law.

###### (iii) Occupied territory.

In occupied enemy territory, the appropriate commander may compel

the attendance of civilian witnesses located within the occupied territory.

##### (F) Relief.

If a person subpoenaed requests relief on grounds that compliance

is unreasonable or oppressive, the convening authority or, after referral,

the military judge may direct that the subpoena be modified or withdrawn

if appropriate.

##### (G) Neglect or refusal to appear.

###### (i) Issuance of warrant of attachment.

The military judge or, if there is no military judge, the convening

authority may, in accordance with this rule, issue a warrant of attachment

to compel the attendance of a witness or production of documents.

####### Discussion

A warrant of attachment (DD Form 454) may be used when necessary to compel a witness to appear or produce evidence under this rule. A warrant of attachment is a legal order addressed to an official directing that official to have the person named in the order brought before a court.

  Subpoenas issued under R.C.M. 703 are Federal process and a person not subject to the code may be prosecuted in a Federal civilian court under Article 47 for failure to comply with a subpoena issued in compliance with this rule and formally served.

  Failing to comply with such a subpoena is a felony offense, and may result in a fine or imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of the district court. The different purposes of the warrant of attachment and criminal complaint under Article 47 should be borne in mind. The warrant of attachment, available without the intervention of civilian judicial proceedings, has as its purpose the obtaining of the witness's presence, testimony, or documents. The criminal complaint, prosecuted through the civilian Federal courts, has as its purpose punishment for failing to comply with process issued by military authority. It serves to vindicate the military interest in obtaining compliance with its lawful process.

  For subpoenas issued for a pretrial investigation pursuant to Article 32 under subsection (f)(4)(B), the general court-martial convening authority with jurisdiction over the case may issue a warrant of attachment to compel production of documents.

###### (ii) Requirements.

A warrant of attachment may be issued only upon probable cause to believe that the witness was duly served with a subpoena, that the subpoena was issued in accordance with these rules, that a means of reimbursement of fees and mileage was provided to the witness or advanced to the witness in cases of hardship, that the witness is material, that the witness refused or willfully neglected to appear at the time and place specified on the subpoena, and that no valid excuse is reasonably apparent for the witness's failure to appear.

###### (iii) Form.

A warrant of attachment shall be written. All documents in support

of the warrant of attachment shall be attached to the warrant, together with

the charge sheet and convening orders.

###### (iv) Execution.

A warrant of attachment may be executed by a United States marshal

or such other person who is not less than 18 years of age as the authority

issuing the warrant may direct. Only such nondeadly force as may be necessary

to bring the witness before the court-martial or other proceeding may be used

to execute the warrant. A witness attached under this rule shall be brought

before the court-martial or proceeding without delay and shall testify as

soon as practicable and be released.

####### Discussion

In executing a warrant of attachment, no more force than necessary

to bring the witness to the court-martial, deposition, or court of inquiry

may be used.

###### (v) Definition.

For purposes of subsection (e)(2)(G) of this rule "military

judge" does not include a summary court-martial or the president of

a special court-martial without a military judge.

### (f) Right to evidence.

#### (1) In general.

Each party is entitled to the production of evidence which is relevant

and necessary.

##### Discussion

Relevance is defined by Mil. R. Evid. 401. Relevant evidence is necessary when it is not cumulative and when it would contribute to a party's presentation of the case in some positive way on a matter in issue. A matter is not in issue when it is stipulated as a fact. The discovery and introduction of classified or other government information is controlled by Mil. R. Evid. 505 and 506.

#### (2) Unavailable evidence.

Notwithstanding subsection (f)(1) of this rule, a party is not entitled

to the production of evidence which is destroyed, lost, or otherwise not

subject to compulsory process. However, if such evidence is of such central

importance to an issue that it is essential to a fair trial, and if there

is no adequate substitute for such evidence, the military judge shall grant

a continuance or other relief in order to attempt to produce the evidence

or shall abate the proceedings, unless the unavailability of the evidence

is the fault of or could have been prevented by the requesting party.

#### (3) Determining what evidence will be produced.

The procedures in subsection (c) of this rule shall apply to a determination

of what evidence will be produced, except that any defense request for the

production of evidence shall list the items of evidence to be produced and

shall include a description of each item sufficient to show its relevance

and necessity, a statement where it can be obtained, and, if known, the name,

address, and telephone number of the custodian of the evidence.

#### (4) Procedures for production of evidence.

##### (A) Evidence under the control of the Government.

Evidence under the control of the Government may be obtained by

notifying the custodian of the evidence of the time, place, and date the

evidence is required and requesting the custodian to send or deliver the evidence.

##### (B) Evidence not under the control of the government.

Evidence not under the control of the government may be obtained by a subpoena issued in accordance with subsection (e)(2) of this rule. A _subpoena duces tecum_ to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 may be issued, following the convening authority's order directing such preliminary hearing, by counsel for the government. A person in receipt of a _subpoena duces tecum_ for an Article 32 hearing need not personally appear in order to comply with the subpoena.

###### Discussion

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, &sect; 542, amended Article 47 to allow the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum for Article 32 hearings. Although the amended language cites Article 32(b), this new subpoena power extends to documents subpoenaed by the investigating officer and counsel representing the United States, whether or not requested by the defense.

##### (C) Relief.

If the person having custody of evidence requests relief on grounds

that compliance with the subpoena or order of production is unreasonable

or oppressive, the convening authority or, after referral, the military judge

may direct that the subpoena or order of production be withdrawn or modified.

Subject to Mil. R. Evid. 505 and 506, the military judge may direct that

the evidence be submitted to the military judge for an in camera inspection

in order to determine whether such relief should be granted.

## Rule 704. Immunity

### (a) Types of immunity.

Two types of immunity may be granted under this rule.

#### (1) Transactional immunity.

A person may be granted transactional immunity from trial by court-martial

for one or more offenses under the code.

#### (2) Testimonial immunity.

A person may be granted immunity from the use of testimony, statements,

and any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or

statements by that person in a later court-martial.

##### Discussion

"Testimonial" immunity is also called "use"

immunity.

  Immunity ordinarily should be granted only when

testimony or other information from the person is necessary to the public

interest, including the needs of good order and discipline, and when the person

 has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information

on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination.

  Testimonial

immunity is preferred because it does not bar prosecution of the person for

 the offenses about which testimony or information is given under the grant

of immunity.

  In any trial of a person granted testimonial

immunity after the testimony or information is given, the Government must

meet a heavy burden to show that it has not used in any way for the prosecution

of that person the person's statements, testimony, or information derived

from them. In many cases this burden makes difficult a later prosecution

of such a person for any offense that was the subject of that person's testimony

 or statements. Therefore, if it is intended to prosecute a person to whom

testimonial immunity has been or will be granted for offenses about which

that person may testify or make statements, it may be necessary to try that

person before the testimony or statements are given.

### (b) Scope.

Nothing in this rule bars:

(1) A later court-martial for perjury, false swearing, making a false

official statement, or failure to comply with an order to testify; or

(2) Use in a court-martial under subsection (b)(1) of this rule of testimony

or statements derived from such testimony or statements.

### (c) Authority to grant immunity.

Only a general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity,

and may do so only in accordance with this rule.

#### Discussion

Only general court-martial convening authorities are authorized

to grant immunity. However, in some circumstances, when a person testifies

or makes statements pursuant to a promise of immunity, or a similar promise,

by a person with apparent authority to make it, such testimony or statements

and evidence derived from them may be inadmissible in a later trial. Under

some circumstances a promise of immunity by someone other than a general

court-martial convening authority may bar prosecution altogether. Persons

not authorized to grant immunity should exercise care when dealing with accused

or suspects to avoid inadvertently causing statements to be inadmissible

or prosecution to be barred.

  A convening authority who grants

immunity to a prosecution witness in a court-martial may be disqualified

from taking post-trial action in the case under some circumstances.

#### (1) Persons subject to the code.

A general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity to

any person subject to the code. However, a general court-martial convening

authority may grant immunity to a person subject to the code extending to

a prosecution in a United States District Court only when specifically authorized

to do so by the Attorney General of the United States or other authority

designated under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 6004.

##### Discussion

When testimony or a statement for which a person subject to the

code may be granted immunity may relate to an offense for which that person

could be prosecuted in a United States District Court, immunity should not

be granted without prior coordination with the Department of Justice. Ordinarily

coordination with the local United States Attorney is appropriate. Unless

the Department of Justice indicates it has no interest in the case, authorization

for the grant of immunity should be sought from the Attorney General. A request

for such authorization should be forwarded through the office of the Judge

Advocate General concerned. Service regulations may provide additional guidance.

Even if the Department of Justice expresses no interest in the case, authorization

by the Attorney General for the grant of immunity may be necessary to compel

 the person to testify or make a statement if such testimony or statement

would make the person liable for a Federal civilian offense.

#### (2) Persons not subject to the code.

A general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity to

persons not subject to the code only when specifically authorized to do so

by the Attorney General of the United States or other authority designated

 under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 6004.

##### Discussion

_See_ the discussion under subsection (c)(1) of this

rule concerning forwarding a request for authorization to grant immunity

to the Attorney General.

#### (3) Other limitations.

The authority to grant immunity under this rule may not be delegated.

The authority to grant immunity may be limited by superior authority.

##### Discussion

Department of Defense Directive 1355.1 (21 July 1981) provides:

"A proposed grant of immunity in a case involving espionage, subversion,

aiding the enemy, sabotage, spying, or violation of rules or statutes concerning

 classified information or the foreign relations of the United States, shall

be forwarded to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense for the

purpose of consultation with the Department of Justice. The General Counsel

shall obtain the view of other appropriate elements of the Department of

defense in furtherance of such consultation."

### (d) Procedure.

A grant of immunity shall be written and signed by the convening

authority who issues it. The grant shall include a statement of the authority

under which it is made and shall identify the matters to which it extends.

#### Discussion

A person who has received a valid grant of immunity from a proper

authority may be ordered to testify. In addition, a servicemember who has

received a valid grant of immunity may be ordered to answer questions by

investigators or counsel pursuant to that grant. _See_ Mil.

R. Evid. 301(c). A person who refuses to testify despite a valid grant of

immunity may be prosecuted for such refusal. Persons subject to the code

may be charged under Article 134. _See_ paragraph 108, Part

IV. A grant of immunity removes the right to refuse to testify or make a

statement on self-incrimination grounds. It does not, however, remove other

 privileges against disclosure of information. _See_ Mil. R.

Evid., Section V.

  An immunity order or grant must not specify

the contents of the testimony it is expected the witness will give.

  When

immunity is granted to a prosecution witness, the accused must be notified

in accordance with Mil. R. Evid. 301(c)(2).

### (e) Decision to grant immunity.

Unless limited by superior competent authority, the decision to

grant immunity is a matter within the sole discretion of the appropriate

general court-martial convening authority. However, if a defense request

to immunize a witness has been denied, the military judge may, upon motion

by the defense, grant appropriate relief directing that either an appropriate

convening authority grant testimonial immunity to a defense witness or, as

to the affected charges and specifications, the proceedings against the accused

be abated, upon findings that:

(1) The witness intends to invoke the right against self-incrimination

to the extent permitted by law if called to testify; and

(2) The Government has engaged in discriminatory use of immunity to

obtain a tactical advantage, or the Government, through its own overreaching,

has forced the witness to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination;

and

(3) The witness' testimony is material, clearly exculpatory, not cumulative,

not obtainable from any other source and does more than merely affect the

credibility of other witnesses.

## Rule 705. Pretrial agreements

### (a) In general.

Subject to such limitations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe,

 an accused and the convening authority may enter into a pretrial agreement

in accordance with this rule.

#### Discussion

The authority of convening authorities to refer cases to trial and

 approve pretrial agreements extends only to trials by courts-martial. To

ensure that such actions do not preclude appropriate action by Federal civilian

authorities in cases likely to be prosecuted in the United States District

Courts, convening authorities shall ensure that appropriate consultation

under the "Memorandum of Understanding Between the Departments of

Justice and Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of Crimes

Over Which the Two Departments Have Concurrent Jurisdiction " has taken

place prior to trial by court-martial or approval of a pretrial agreement

in cases where such consultation is required. _ See_ Appendix

3.

### (b) Nature of agreement.

A pretrial agreement may include:

(1) A promise by the accused to plead guilty to, or to enter a confessional

stipulation as to one or more charges and specifications, and to fulfill

such additional terms or conditions which may be included in the agreement

and which are not prohibited under this rule; and

(2) A promise by the convening authority to do one or more of the following:

(A) Refer the charges to a certain type of court-martial;

(B) Refer a capital offense as noncapital;

(C) Withdraw one or more charges or specifications from the court-martial;

###### Discussion

A convening authority may withdraw certain specifications and/or

 charges from a court-martial and dismiss them if the accused fulfills the

accused's promises in the agreement. Except when jeopardy has attached

(_see_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)), such withdrawal and dismissal

does not bar later reinstitution of the charges by the same or a different

convening authority. A judicial determination that the accused breached

the pretrial agreement is not required prior to reinstitution of withdrawn

or dismissed specifications and/or charges.  If the defense moves to dismiss

the reinstituted specifications and/or charges on the grounds that the government

 remains bound by the terms of the pretrial agreement, the government will

be required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the accused

has breached the terms of the pretrial agreement. If the agreement is intended

 to grant immunity to an accused, _see_ R.C.M. 704.

(D) Have the trial counsel present no evidence as to one or more specifications

or portions thereof; and

(E) Take specified action on the sentence adjudged by the court-martial.

###### Discussion

For example, the convening authority may agree to approve no sentence

 in excess of a specified maximum, to suspend all or part of a sentence,

to defer confinement, or to mitigate certain forms of punishment into less

severe forms.

### (c) Terms and conditions.

#### (1) Prohibited terms or conditions.

##### (A) Not voluntary.

A term or condition in a pretrial agreement shall not be enforced

if the accused did not freely and voluntarily agree to it.

##### (B) Deprivation of certain rights.

A term or condition in a pretrial agreement shall not be enforced

if it deprives the accused of: the right to counsel; the right to due process;

the right to challenge the jurisdiction of the court-martial; the right

to a speedy trial; the right to complete sentencing proceedings; the complete

and effective exercise of post-trial and appellate rights.

###### Discussion

A pretrial agreement provision which prohibits the accused from

 making certain pretrial motions (_see_ R.C.M. 905-907)

may be improper.

#### (2) Permissible terms or conditions.

Subject to subsection (c)(1)(A) of this rule, subsection (c)(1)(B)

of this rule does not prohibit either party from proposing the following

additional conditions:

(A) A promise to enter into a stipulation of fact concerning offenses

to which a plea of guilty or as to which a confessional stipulation will

be entered;

(B) A promise to testify as a witness in the trial of another person;

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 704(a)(2) concerning testimonial immunity.

Only a general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity.

(C) A promise to provide restitution;

(D) A promise to conform the accused's conduct to certain conditions

of probation before action by the convening authority as well as during

any period of suspension of the sentence, provided that the requirements

 of R.C.M. 1109 must be complied with before an alleged violation of such

terms may relieve the convening authority of the obligation to fulfill the

agreement; and

(E) A promise to waive procedural requirements such as the Article 32 preliminary hearing, the right to trial by court-martial composed of members or

the right to request trial by military judge alone, or the opportunity to

obtain the personal appearance of witnesses at sentencing proceedings.

### (d) Procedure.

#### (1) Negotiation.

Pretrial agreement negotiations may be initiated by the accused,

 defense counsel, trial counsel, the staff judge advocate, convening authority,

or their duly authorized representatives. Either the defense or the government

may propose any term or condition not prohibited by law or public policy.

Government representatives shall negotiate with defense counsel unless the

accused has waived the right to counsel.

#### (2) Formal submission.

After negotiation, if any, under subsection (d)(1) of this rule,

if the accused elects to propose a pretrial agreement, the defense shall

submit a written offer. All terms, conditions, and promises between the

parties shall be written. The proposed agreement shall be signed by the accused

and defense counsel, if any. If the agreement contains any specified action

on the adjudged sentence, such action shall be set forth on a page separate

from the other portions of the agreement.

##### Discussion

The first part of the agreement ordinarily contains an offer to

plead guilty and a description of the offenses to which the offer extends.

It must also contain a complete and accurate statement of any other agreed

terms or conditions. For example, if the convening authority agrees to withdraw

certain specifications, or if the accused agrees to waive the right to an

Article 32 preliminary hearing, this should be stated. The written agreement should

contain a statement by the accused that the accused enters it freely and

voluntarily and may contain a statement that the accused has been advised

of certain rights in connection with the agreement.

#### (3) Acceptance.

The convening authority may either accept or reject an offer of

the accused to enter into a pretrial agreement or may propose by counteroffer

any terms or conditions not prohibited by law or public policy. The decision

whether to accept or reject an offer is within the sole discretion of the

convening authority. When the convening authority has accepted a pretrial

agreement, the agreement shall be signed by the convening authority or by

a person, such as the staff judge advocate or trial counsel, who has been

authorized by the convening authority to sign.

##### Discussion

The convening authority should consult with the staff judge advocate

 or trial counsel before acting on an offer to enter into a pretrial agreement.

#### (4) Withdrawal.

##### (A) By accused.

The accused may withdraw from a pretrial agreement at any time;

 however, the accused may withdraw a plea of guilty or a confessional stipulation

entered pursuant to a pretrial agreement only as provided in R.C.M. 910(h)

or 811(d), respectively.

##### (B) By convening authority.

The convening authority may withdraw from a pretrial agreement at

any time before the accused begins performance of promises contained in the

agreement, upon the failure by the accused to fulfill any material promise

or condition in the agreement, when inquiry by the military judge discloses

a disagreement as to a material term in the agreement, or if findings are

set aside because a plea of guilty entered pursuant to the agreement is held

improvident on appellate review.

### (e) Nondisclosure of existence of agreement.

Except in a special court-martial without a military judge, no member

of a court-martial shall be informed of the existence of a pretrial agreement.

In addition, except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 410, the fact that an accused

offered to enter into a pretrial agreement, and any statements made by an

accused in connection therewith, whether during negotiations or during a

providence inquiry, shall not be otherwise disclosed to the members.

#### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 910(f) (plea agreement inquiry).

## Rule 706. Inquiry into the mental capacity or mental responsibility of the accused

### (a) Initial action.

If it appears to any commander who considers the disposition of

charges, or to any preliminary hearing officer, trial counsel, defense counsel,

military judge, or member that there is reason to believe that the accused

lacked mental responsibility for any offense charged or lacks capacity to

stand trial, that fact and the basis of the belief or observation shall be

transmitted through appropriate channels to the officer authorized to order

an inquiry into the mental condition of the accused. The submission may be

accompanied by an application for a mental examination under this rule.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 909 concerning the capacity of the accused

to stand trial and R.C.M. 916(k) concerning mental responsibility of the

accused.

### (b) Ordering an inquiry.

#### (1) Before referral.

Before referral of charges, an inquiry into the mental capacity

or mental responsibility of the accused may be ordered by the convening authority

before whom the charges are pending for disposition.

#### (2) After referral.

After referral of charges, an inquiry into the mental capacity or

mental responsibility of the accused may be ordered by the military judge.

The convening authority may order such an inquiry after referral of charges

but before beginning of the first session of the court-martial (including

any Article 39(a) session) when the military judge is not reasonably available.

The military judge may order a mental examination of the accused regardless

of any earlier determination by the convening authority.

### (c) Inquiry.

#### (1) By whom conducted.

When a mental examination is ordered under subsection (b) of this

rule, the matter shall be referred to a board consisting of one or more persons.

Each member of the board shall be either a physician or a clinical psychologist.

Normally, at least one member of the board shall be either a psychiatrist

or a clinical psychologist. The board shall report as to the mental capacity

or mental responsibility or both of the accused.

#### (2) Matters in inquiry.

When a mental examination is ordered under this rule, the order

shall contain the reasons for doubting the mental capacity or mental responsibility,

or both, of the accused, or other reasons for requesting the examination.

In addition to other requirements, the order shall require the board to make

separate and distinct findings as to each of the following questions:

(A) At the time of the alleged criminal conduct, did the accused have

a severe mental disease or defect? (The term "severe mental disease

or defect" does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated

 criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct, or minor disorders such as nonpsychotic

behavior disorders and personality defects.)

(B) What is the clinical psychiatric diagnosis?

(C) Was the accused, at the time of the alleged criminal conduct and

as a result of such severe mental disease or defect, unable to appreciate

the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his or her conduct?

(D) Is the accused presently suffering from a mental disease or defect

rendering the accused unable to understand the nature of the proceedings

against the accused or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense?



Other

appropriate questions may also be included.

#### (3) Directions to board.

In addition to the requirements specified in subsection (c)(2) of

 this rule, the order to the board shall specify:

(A) That upon completion of the board's investigation, a statement

consisting only of the board's ultimate conclusions as to all questions specified

in the order shall be submitted to the officer ordering the examination,

 the accused's commanding officer, the preliminary hearing officer, if any, appointed

 pursuant to Article 32 and to all counsel in the case, the convening authority,

and, after referral, to the military judge;

(B) That the full report of the board may be released by the board or

 other medical personnel only to other medical personnel for medical purposes,

unless otherwise authorized by the convening authority or, after referral

 of charges, by the military judge, except that a copy of the full report

shall be furnished to the defense and, upon request, to the commanding officer

of the accused; and

(C) That neither the contents of the full report nor any matter considered

by the board during its investigation shall be released by the board or other

medical personnel to any person not authorized to receive the full report,

 except pursuant to an order by the military judge.

###### Discussion

Based on the report, further action in the case may be suspended,

the charges may be dismissed by the convening authority, administrative

action may be taken to discharge the accused from the service or, subject

to Mil. R. Evid. 302, the charges may be tried by court-martial.

#### (4) Additional examinations.

Additional examinations may be directed under this rule at any stage

 of the proceedings as circumstances may require.

#### (5) Disclosure to trial counsel.

No person, other than the defense counsel, accused, or, after referral

of charges, the military judge may disclose to the trial counsel any statement

made by the accused to the board or any evidence derived from such statement.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 302.

## Rule 707. Speedy trial

### (a) In general.

The accused shall be brought to trial within 120 days after the

 earlier of:

(1) Preferral of charges;

##### Discussion

Delay from the time of an offense to preferral of charges or the

 imposition of pretrial restraint is not considered for speedy trial purposes. _

See also_ Article 43 (statute of limitations). In some circumstances

such delay may prejudice the accused and may result in dismissal of the

charges or other relief. Offenses ordinarily should be disposed of promptly

to serve the interests of good order and discipline. Priority shall be given

to persons in arrest or confinement.

(2) The imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4); or

(3) Entry on active duty under R.C.M. 204.

### (b) Accountability.

#### (1) In general.

The date of preferral of charges, the date on which pretrial restraint

under R.C.M. 304 (a)(2)-(4) is imposed, or the date of entry on active duty

under R.C.M. 204 shall not count for purpose of computing time under subsection

(a) of this rule. The date on which the accused is brought to trial shall

count. The accused is brought to trial within the meaning of this rule at

the time of arraignment under R.C.M. 904.

#### (2) Multiple Charges.

When charges are preferred at different times, accountability for

 each charge shall be determined from the appropriate date under subsection

(a) of this rule for that charge.

#### (3) Events which affect time periods.

##### (A) Dismissal or mistrial.

If charges are dismissed, or if a mistrial is granted, a new 120-day

 time period under this rule shall begin on the date of dismissal or mistrial

for cases in which there is no repreferral and cases in which the accused

is in pretrial restraint. In all other cases, a new 120-day time period under

the rule shall begin on the earlier of

(i) the date of repreferral; or

(ii) the date of imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4).

##### (B) Release from restraint.

If the accused is released from pretrial restraint for a significant

 period, the 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the earlier

of

(i) the date of preferral of charges;

(ii) the date on which restraint under R.C.M. 304(a) (2)-(4) is reimposed;

 or

(iii) the date of entry on active duty under R.C.M. 204.

##### (C) Government appeals.

If notice of appeal under R.C.M. 908 is filed, a new 120-day time

 period under this rule shall begin, for all charges neither proceeded on

nor severed under R.C.M. 908(b)(4), on the date of notice to the parties

 under R.C.M. 908(b)(8) or 908(c)(3), unless it is determined that the appeal

 was filed solely for the purpose of delay with the knowledge that it was

totally frivolous and without merit. After the decision of the Court of

Criminal Appeals under R.C.M. 908, if there is a further appeal to the Court

of Appeals for the Armed Forces or, subsequently, to the Supreme Court, a

new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date the parties

are notified of the final decision of the Court of Appeals for the Armed

Forces, or, if appropriate, the Supreme Court.

##### (D) Rehearings.

If a rehearing is ordered or authorized by an appellate court, a

new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date that the responsible

convening authority receives the record of trial and the opinion authorizing

or directing a rehearing. An accused is brought to trial within the meaning

of this rule at the time of arraignment under R.C.M. 904 or, if arraignment

is not required (such as in the case of a sentence-only rehearing), at the

time of the first session under R.C.M. 803.

##### (E) Commitment of the incompetent accused.

If the accused is committed to the custody of the Attorney General

 for hospitalization as provided in R.C.M. 909(f), all periods of such commitment

shall be excluded when determining whether the period in subsection (a)

of this rule has run. If, at the end of the period of commitment, the accused

is returned to the custody of the general court-martial convening authority,

a new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date of such

return to custody.

### (c) Excludable delay.

All periods of time during which appellate courts have issued stays

in the proceedings, or the accused is absent without authority, or the accused

is hospitalized due to incompetence, or is otherwise in the custody of the

Attorney General, shall be excluded when determining whether the period in

subsection (a) of this rule has run. All other pretrial delays approved by

a military judge or the convening authority shall be similarly excluded.

#### (1) Procedure.

Prior to referral, all requests for pretrial delay, together with

 supporting reasons, will be submitted to the convening authority or, if

authorized under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, to a

military judge for resolution. After referral, such requests for pretrial

 delay will be submitted to the military judge for resolution.

##### Discussion

The decision to grant or deny a reasonable delay is a matter within

 the sole discretion of the convening authority or a military judge. This

decision should be based on the facts and circumstances then and there existing.

Reasons to grant a delay might, for example, include the need for: time to

enable counsel to prepare for trial in complex cases; time to allow examination

into the mental capacity of the accused; time to process a member of the

reserve component to active duty for disciplinary action; time to complete

 other proceedings related to the case; time requested by the defense; time

to secure the availability of the accused, substantial witnesses, or other

evidence; time to obtain appropriate security clearances for access to classified

information or time to declassify evidence; or additional time for other

good cause.

  Pretrial delays should not be granted ex parte,

and when practicable, the decision granting the delay, together with supporting

reasons and the dates covering the delay, should be reduced to writing.

  Prior

to referral, the convening authority may delegate the authority to grant

continuances to an Article 32 preliminary hearing officer.

#### (2) Motions.

Upon accused's timely motion to a military judge under R.C.M. 905

for speedy trial relief, counsel should provide the court a chronology detailing

the processing of the case. This chronology should be made a part of the

appellate record.

### (d) Remedy.

A failure to comply with this rule will result in dismissal of the

affected charges, or, in a sentence-only rehearing, sentence relief as appropriate.

#### (1) Dismissal.

Dismissal will be with or without prejudice to the government's

right to reinstitute court-martial proceedings against the accused for the

same offense at a later date. The charges must be dismissed with prejudice

where the accused has been deprived of his or her constitutional right to

a speedy trial. In determining whether to dismiss charges with or without

prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors:

 the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case that

lead to dismissal; the impact of a re-prosecution on the administration of

justice; and any prejudice to the accused resulting from the denial of a speedy

trial.

#### (2) Sentence relief.

In determining whether or how much sentence relief is appropriate,

the military judge shall consider, among others, each of the following factors:

the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused's demand for

speedy trial, and any prejudice to the accused from the delay. Any sentence

relief granted will be applied against the sentence approved by the convening

authority.

##### Discussion

_See_ subsection (c)(1) and the accompanying Discussion

concerning reasons for delay and procedures for parties to request delay.

### (e) Waiver.

Except as provided in R.C.M. 910(a)(2), a plea of guilty which

results in a finding of guilty waives any speedy trial issue as to that offense.

#### Discussion

Speedy trial issues may also be waived by a failure to raise the

 issue at trial. _See_ R.C.M. 905(e) and 907(b)(2).

# CHAPTER VIII. TRIAL PROCEDURE GENERALLY

## Rule 801. Military judge's responsibilities; other matters

### (a) Responsibilities of military judge.

The military judge is the presiding officer in a court-martial.

#### Discussion

The military judge is responsible for ensuring that court-martial

proceedings are conducted in a fair and orderly manner, without unnecessary

delay or waste of time or resources. Unless otherwise specified, the president

of a special court-martial without a military judge has the same authority

and responsibility as a military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 502(b)(2).

The military judge shall:

(1) Determine the time and uniform for each session of a court-martial;

##### Discussion

The military judge should consult with counsel concerning the scheduling

of sessions and the uniform to be worn. The military judge recesses or adjourns

the court-martial as appropriate. Subject to R.C.M. 504(d)(1), the military

judge may also determine the place of trial. _See also_ R.C.M.

906(b)(11).

(2) Ensure that the dignity and decorum of the proceedings are maintained;

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 804 and 806. Courts-martial should

be conducted in an atmosphere which is conducive to calm and detached deliberation

and determination of the issues presented and which reflects the seriousness

of the proceedings.

(3) Subject to the code and this Manual, exercise reasonable control

over the proceedings to promote the purposes of these rules and this Manual;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 102. The military judge may, within

the framework established by the code and this Manual, prescribe the manner

and order in which the proceedings may take place. Thus, the military judge

 may determine: when, and in what order, motions will be

 litigated (_see_ R.C.M. 905); the manner in which voir dire will be conducted

and challenges made (_see_ R.C.M. 902(d) and 912); the order

 in which witnesses may testify (_see_ R.C.M. 913; Mil. R.

Evid. 611); the order in which the parties may argue on a motion or objection;

and the time limits for argument (_see_ R.C.M. 905; 919; 1001(g)).

  The

military judge should prevent unnecessary waste of time and promote the ascertainment

 of truth, but must avoid undue interference with the parties' presentations

or the appearance of partiality. The parties are entitled to a reasonable

opportunity to properly present and support their contentions on any relevant

matter.

(4) Subject to subsection (e) of this rule, rule on all interlocutory

questions and all questions of law raised during the court-martial; and

(5) Instruct the members on questions of law and procedure which may

arise.

##### Discussion

The military judge instructs the members concerning findings

(_see_ R.C.M. 920) and sentence (_see_ R.C.M. 1005),

and when otherwise appropriate. For example, preliminary instructions to

the members concerning their duties and the duties of other trial participants

and other matters are normally appropriate. _See_ R.C.M. 913.

Other instructions (for example, instructions on the limited purpose for

which evidence has been introduced, _see_ Mil. R. Evid. 105)

may be given whenever the need arises.

(6) In the case of a victim of an offense under the UCMJ who is under 18 years of age and not a member of the armed forces, or who is incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, designate in writing a family member, a representative of the estate of the victim, or another suitable individual to assume the victim's rights under the UCMJ.

(A) For the purposes of this rule, the individual is designated for the sole purpose of assuming the legal rights of the victim as they pertain to the victim's status as a victim of any offense(s) properly before the court.

##### Discussion

 The rights that a designee may exercise on behalf of a victim include the right to receive notice of public hearings in the case; the right to be reasonably heard at such hearings, if permitted by law; and the right to confer with counsel representing the government at such hearings. The designee may also be the custodial guardian of the child.

 When determining whom to appoint under this rule, the military judge may consider the following: the age and maturity, relationship to the victim, and physical proximity of any proposed designee; the costs incurred in effecting the appointment; the willingness of the proposed designee to serve in such a role; the previous appointment of a guardian by another court of competent jurisdiction; the preference of the victim; any potential delay in any proceeding that may be caused by a specific appointment; and any other relevant information.

(B) Procedure to determine appointment of designee.

(i) As soon as practicable, trial counsel shall notify the military judge, counsel for the accused and the victim(s) of any offense(s) properly before the court when there is an apparent requirement to appoint a designee under this rule.

###### Discussion

 In the event a case involves multiple victims who are entitled to notice under this rule, each victim is only entitled to notice relating to his or her own designated representative.

(ii) The military judge will determine if the appointment of a designee is required under this rule.

(iii) At the discretion of the military judge, victim(s), trial counsel, and the accused may be given the opportunity to recommend to the military judge individual(s) for appointment.

(iv) The military judge is not required to hold a hearing before determining whether a designation is required or making such an appointment under this rule.

(v) If the military judge determines a hearing pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ, is necessary, the following shall be notified of the hearing and afforded the right to be present at the hearing: trial counsel, accused, and the victim(s).

(vi) The individual designated shall not be the accused.

(C) At any time after appointment, a designee shall be excused upon request by the designee or a finding of good cause by the military judge.

(D) If the individual appointed to assume the victim's rights is excused, the military judge shall appoint a successor consistent with this rule.

###### Discussion

 The term "victim of an offense under the UCMJ" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ. "Good Cause" means adequate or reasonable grounds to believe that the individual appointed to assume the victim's rights is not acting or does not intend to act in the best interest of the victim.

### (b) Rules of court; contempt.

The military judge may:

(1) Subject to R.C.M. 108, promulgate and enforce rules of court.

(2) Subject to R.C.M. 809, exercise contempt power.

### (c) Obtaining evidence.

The court-martial may act to obtain evidence in addition to that

 presented by the parties. The right of the members to have additional evidence

obtained is subject to an interlocutory ruling by the military judge.

#### Discussion

The members may request and the military judge may require that

a witness be recalled, or that a new witness be summoned, or other evidence

produced. The members or military judge may direct trial counsel to make

an inquiry along certain lines to discover and produce additional evidence. _

See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 614. In taking such action, the court-martial

must not depart from an impartial role.

### (d) Uncharged offenses.

If during the trial there is evidence that the accused may be guilty

of an untried offense not alleged in any specification before the court-martial,

the court-martial shall proceed with the trial of the offense charged.

#### Discussion

A report of the matter may be made to the convening authority after

trial. If charges are preferred for an offense indicated by the evidence

referred to in this subsection, no member of the court-martial who participated

in the first trial should sit in any later trial. Such a member would ordinarily

be subject to a challenge for cause. _See_ R.C.M. 912. _

See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 105 concerning instructing the members on

evidence of uncharged misconduct.

### (e) Interlocutory questions and questions of law.

For purposes of this subsection "military judge" does

not include the president of a special court-martial without a military

judge.

#### (1) Rulings by the military judge.

##### (A) Finality of rulings.

Any ruling by the military judge upon a question of law, including

a motion for a finding of not guilty, or upon any interlocutory question

is final.

##### (B) Changing a ruling.

The military judge may change a ruling made by that or another

military judge in the case except a previously granted motion for a finding

of not guilty, at any time during the trial.

##### (C) Article 39(a) sessions.

When required by this Manual or otherwise deemed appropriate by

the military judge, interlocutory questions or questions of law shall be

presented and decided at sessions held without members under R.C.M. 803.

###### Discussion

Sessions without members are appropriate for interlocutory questions,

 questions of law, and instructions. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid.

103; 304; 311; 321. Such sessions should be used to the extent possible

consistent with the orderly, expeditious progress of the proceedings.

#### (2) Ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a military

 judge.

##### (A) Questions of law.

Any ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a

 military judge on any question of law other than a motion for a finding

of not guilty is final.

##### (B) Questions of fact.

Any ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a

 military judge on any interlocutory question of fact, including a factual

issue of mental capacity of the accused, or on a motion for a finding of

not guilty, is final unless objected to by a member.

##### (C) Changing a ruling.

The president of a special court-martial without a military judge

may change a ruling made by that or another president in the case except

a previously granted motion for a finding of not guilty, at any time during

 the trial.

##### (D) Presence of members.

Except as provided in R.C.M. 505 and 912, all members will be present

 at all sessions of a special court-martial without a military judge, including

sessions at which questions of law or interlocutory questions are litigated.

However, the president of a special court-martial without a military judge

may examine an offered item of real or documentary evidence before ruling

on its admissibility without exposing it to other members.

#### (3) Procedures for rulings by the president of a special court-martial

 without a military judge which are subject to objection by a member.

##### (A) Determination.

The president of a special court-martial without a military judge

 shall determine whether a ruling is subject to objection.

##### (B) Instructions.

When a ruling by the president of a special court-martial without

a military judge is subject to objection, the president shall so advise

the members and shall give such instructions on the issue as may be necessary

to enable the members to understand the issue and the legal standards by

which they will determine it if objection is made.

##### (C) Voting.

When a member objects to a ruling by the president of a special

court-martial without a military judge which is subject to objection, the

court-martial shall be closed, and the members shall vote orally, beginning

 with the junior in rank, and the question shall be decided by a majority

vote. A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty is a determination

against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination

in favor of the accused.

##### (D) Consultation.

The president of a special court-martial without a military judge

may close the court-martial and consult with other members before ruling

on a matter, when such ruling is subject to the objection of any member.

#### (4) Standard of proof.

Questions of fact in an interlocutory question shall be determined

by a preponderance of the evidence, unless otherwise stated in this Manual.

In the absence of a rule in this Manual assigning the burden of persuasion,

 the party making the motion or raising the objection shall bear the burden

of persuasion.

##### Discussion

A ruling on an interlocutory question should be preceded by any

necessary inquiry into the pertinent facts and law. For example, the party

making the objection, motion, or request may be required to furnish evidence

or legal authority in support of the contention. An interlocutory issue may

have a different standard of proof. _See_, for example, Mil.

R. Evid. 314(e)(5), which requires consent for a search to be proved by clear

and convincing evidence.

  Most of the common motions are

discussed in specific rules in this Manual, and the burden of persuasion

is assigned therein. The prosecution usually bears the burden of persuasion

(_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 304(e); 311(e); _see also_ R.C.M.

905 through 907) once an issue has been raised. What "raises"

an issue may vary with the issue. Some issues may be raised by a timely motion

or objection. _See_, for example, Mil. R. Evid. 304(e). Others

may not be raised until the defense has made an offer of proof or presented

evidence in support of its position. _See_, for example, Mil.

R. Evid. 311(g)(2). The rules in this Manual and relevant decisions should

be consulted when a question arises as to whether an issue is raised, as

well as which side has the burden of persuasion. The military judge or president

of a special court-martial may require a party to clarify a motion or objection

or to make an offer of proof, regardless of the burden of persuasion, when

it appears that the motion or objection is vague, inapposite, irrelevant,

or spurious.

#### (5) Scope.

Subsection (e) of this rule applies to the disposition of questions

of law and interlocutory questions arising during trial except the question

whether a challenge should be sustained.

##### Discussion

Questions of law and interlocutory questions include all issues

which arise during trial other than the findings (that is, guilty or not

guilty), sentence, and administrative matters such as declaring recesses and

 adjournments. A question may be both interlocutory and a question of law.

Challenges are specifically covered in R.C.M. 902 and 912.

  Questions

of the applicability of a rule of law to an undisputed set of facts are normally

 questions of law. Similarly, the legality of an act is normally a question

of law. For example, the legality of an order when disobedience of an order

is charged, the legality of restraint when there is a prosecution for breach

of arrest, or the sufficiency of warnings before interrogation are normally

questions of law. It is possible, however, for such questions to be decided

solely upon some factual issue, in which case they would be questions of

fact. For example, the question of what warnings, if any, were given by an

interrogator to a suspect would be a factual question.

  A

question is interlocutory unless the ruling on it would finally decide whether

the accused is guilty. Questions which may determine the ultimate issue of

guilt are not interlocutory. An issue may arise as both an interlocutory

question and a question which may determine the ultimate issue of guilt. An

 issued is not purely interlocutory if an accused raises a defense or objection

and the disputed facts involved determine the ultimate question of guilt.

For example, if during a trial for desertion the accused moves to dismiss

for lack of jurisdiction and presents some evidence that the accused is not

a member of an armed force, the accused's status as a military person may

determine the ultimate question of guilt because status is an element of

the offense. If the motion is denied, the disputed facts must be resolved

by each member in deliberation upon the findings. (The accused's status as

a servicemember would have to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence

to uphold jurisdiction, _ see_ R.C.M. 907, but beyond a reasonable

doubt to permit a finding of guilty.) If, on the other hand, the accused

was charged with larceny and presented the same evidence as to military status,

the evidence would bear only upon amenability to trial and the issue would

be disposed of solely as an interlocutory question.

  Interlocutory

questions may be questions of fact or questions of law. This distinction is

important because the president of a special court-martial without a military

judge rules finally on interlocutory questions of law, but not on interlocutory

questions of fact. On interlocutory questions of fact the president of a

special court-martial without a military judge rules subject to the objection

of any other member. On mixed questions of fact and law, rulings by the president

are subject to objection by any member to the extent that the issue of fact

can be isolated and considered separately.

### (f) Rulings on record.

All sessions involving rulings or instructions made or given by

the military judge or the president of a special court-martial without a

military judge shall be made a part of the record. All rulings and instructions

shall be made or given in open session in the presence of the parties and

the members, except as otherwise may be determined in the discretion of the

military judge. For purposes of this subsection [R.C.M. 801(f)]

"military judge" does not include the president of a special

court-martial without a military judge.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 808 and 1103 concerning preparation

of the record of trial.

### (g) Effect of failure to raise defenses or objections.

Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests

or motions which must be made at the time set by this Manual or by the military

judge under authority of this Manual, or prior to any extension thereof made

by the military judge, shall constitute waiver thereof, but the military judge

for good cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.

## Rule 802. Conferences

### (a) In general.

After referral, the military judge may, upon request of any party

or _sua sponte_, order one or more conferences with the parties

to consider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial.

#### Discussion

Conferences between the military judge and counsel may be held when

necessary before or during trial. The purpose of such conference is to inform

the military judge of anticipated issues and to expeditiously resolve matters

on which the parties can agree, not to litigate or decide contested issues. _

See_ subsection (c) below. No party may be compelled to resolve any

matter at a conference.

  A conference may be appropriate

in order to resolve scheduling difficulties, so that witnesses and members

are not unnecessarily inconvenienced. Matters which will ultimately be in

the military judge's discretion, such as conduct of voir dire, seating arrangements

in the courtroom, or procedures when there are multiple accused may be resolved

at a conference. Conferences may be used to advise the military judge of issues

 or problems, such as unusual motions or objections, which are likely to arise

during trial.

  Occasionally it may be appropriate to resolve

certain issues, in addition to routine or administrative matters, if this

can be done with the consent of the parties. For example, a request for a

witness which, if litigated and approved at trial, would delay the proceedings

and cause expense or inconvenience, might be resolved at a conference. Note,

however, that this could only be done by an agreement of the parties and

not by a binding ruling of the military judge. Such a resolution must be included

in the record. _See_ subsection (b) below.

  A

military judge may not participate in negotiations relating to pleas. _

See_ R.C.M. 705 and Mil. R. Evid. 410.

  No place

or method is prescribed for conducting a conference.

A conference may be conducted by remote means or similar technology consistent with the definition in R.C.M. 914B.



### (b) Matters on record.

Conferences need not be made part of the record, but matters agreed

upon at a conference shall be included in the record orally or in writing.

Failure of a party to object at trial to failure to comply with this subsection

 shall waive this requirement.

### (c) Rights of parties.

No party may be prevented under this rule from presenting evidence

or from making any argument, objection, or motion at trial.

### (d) Accused's presence.

The presence of the accused is neither required nor prohibited at

a conference.

#### Discussion

Normally the defense counsel may be presumed to speak for the accused.

### (e) Admission.

No admissions made by the accused or defense counsel at a conference

shall be used against the accused unless the admissions are reduced to writing

and signed by the accused and defense counsel.

### (f) Limitations.

This rule shall not be invoked in the case of an accused who is

not represented by counsel, or in special court-martial without a military

judge.

## Rule 803. Court-martial sessions without members under Article 39(a)

A military judge who has been detailed to the court-martial may,

under Article 39(a), after service of charges, call the court-martial into

session without the presence of members. Such sessions may be held before

and after assembly of the court-martial, and when authorized in these rules,

after adjournment and before action by the convening authority. All such

sessions are a part of the trial and shall be conducted in the presence of

the accused, defense counsel, and trial counsel, in accordance with R.C.M.

804 and 805, and shall be made a part of the record. For purposes of this

rule "military judge" does not include the president of a special

court-martial without a military judge.

### Discussion

The purpose of Article 39(a) is "to give statutory sanction

to pretrial and other hearings without the presence of the members concerning

those matters which are amenable to disposition on either a tentative or

final basis by the military judge." The military judge and members may,

and ordinarily should, call the court-martial into session without members

to ascertain the accused's understanding of the right to counsel, the right

to request trial by military judge alone, or when applicable, enlisted members,

and the accused's choices with respect to these matters; dispose of interlocutory

matters; hear objections and motions; rule upon other matters that may legally

be ruled upon by the military judge, such as admitting evidence; and perform

other procedural functions which do not require the presence of members. _

See_, for example, R.C.M. 901-910. The military judge may, if

permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned, hold the arraignment,

receive pleas, and enter findings of guilty upon an accepted plea of guilty.

  Evidence

may be admitted and process, including a subpoena, may be issued to compel

attendance of witnesses and production of evidence at such sessions. _

See_ R.C.M. 703.

  Article 39(a) authorizes sessions

only after charges have been referred to trial and served on the accused,

but the accused has an absolute right to object, in time of peace, to any

session until the period prescribed by Article 35 has run.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 804 concerning waiver by the accused of the right to be

present. _See also_ R.C.M. 802 concerning conferences.

## Rule 804. Presence of the accused at trial proceedings

### (a) Presence required.

The accused shall be present at the arraignment, the time of the

plea, every stage of the trial including sessions conducted under Article

39(a), voir dire and challenges of members, the return of the findings, sentencing

proceedings, and post-trial sessions, if any, except as otherwise provided

by this rule.

### (b) Presence by remote means.

If authorized by the regulations of the Secretary concerned, the military judge may order the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology, between the parties and the military judge for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions. Use of such audiovisual technology will satisfy the "presence" requirement of the accused only when the accused has a defense counsel physically present at his location. Such technology may include two or more remote sites as long as all parties can see and hear each other.

#### (c) Continued presence not required.

The further progress of the trial to and including the return of

the findings and, if necessary, determination of a sentence shall not be

prevented and the accused shall be considered to have waived the right to

be present whenever an accused, initially present:

(1) Is voluntarily absent after arraignment (whether or not informed

by the military judge of the obligation to remain during the trial); or

(2) After being warned by the military judge that disruptive conduct

will cause the accused to be removed from the courtroom, persists in conduct

which is such as to justify exclusion from the courtroom.

###### Discussion

_Express waiver._ The accused may expressly waive

the right to be present at trial proceedings. There is no right to be absent,

however, and the accused may be required to be present over objection. Thus,

an accused cannot frustrate efforts to identify the accused at trial by waiving

the right to be present. The right to be present is so fundamental, and the

Government's interest in the attendance of the accused so substantial, that

the accused should be permitted to waive the right to be present only for

good cause, and only after the military judge explains to the accused the

right, and the consequences of foregoing it, and secures the accused's personal

consent to proceeding without the accused.

  _Voluntary

absence._ In any case the accused may forfeit the right to be present

 by being voluntarily absent after arraignment.

  "Voluntary

absence" means voluntary absence from trial. For an absence from court-martial

 proceedings to be voluntary, the accused must have known of the scheduled

proceedings and intentionally missed them. For example, although an accused

servicemember might voluntarily be absent without authority, this would not

justify proceeding with a court-martial in the accused's absence unless the

accused was aware that the court-martial would be held during the period

of the absence.

  An accused who is in military custody or

otherwise subject to military control at the time of trial or other proceeding

may not properly be absent from the trial or proceeding without securing the

permission of the military judge on the record.

  The prosecution

has the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the accused's

absence from trial is voluntary. Voluntariness may not be presumed, but it

may be inferred, depending on the circumstances. For example, it may be inferred,

in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that an accused who was present

when the trial recessed and who knew when the proceedings were scheduled to

resume, but who nonetheless is not present when court reconvenes at the designated

time, is absent voluntarily.

  Where there is some evidence

that an accused who is absent for a hearing or trial may lack mental capacity

to stand trial, capacity to voluntarily waive the right to be present for

trial must be shown. _See_ R.C.M. 909.

  Subsection

(1) authorizes but does not require trial to proceed in the absence of the

 accused upon the accused's voluntary absence. When an accused is absent from

trial after arraignment, a continuance or a recess may be appropriate, depending

on all the circumstances.

  Presence of the accused by remote means does not require the consent of the accused.

  _Removal for disruption.

_ Trial may proceed without the presence of an accused who has disrupted

the proceedings, but only after at least one warning by the military judge

that such behavior may result in removal from the courtroom. In order to

justify removal from the proceedings, the accused's behavior should be of

 such a nature as to materially interfere with the conduct of the proceedings.

  The

military judge should consider alternatives to removal of a disruptive accused.

Such alternatives include physical restraint (such as binding, shackling,

and gagging) of the accused, or physically segregating the accused in the

courtroom. Such alternatives need not be tried before removing a disruptive

accused under subsection (2). Removal may be preferable to such an alternative

as binding and gagging, which can be an affront to the dignity and decorum

of the proceedings.

  Disruptive behavior of the accused may

also constitute contempt. _See_ R.C.M. 809. When the accused

is removed from the courtroom for disruptive behavior, the military judge

should-

(A) Afford the accused and defense counsel ample opportunity to consult

throughout the proceedings. To this end, the accused should be held or otherwise

required to remain in the vicinity of the trial, and frequent recesses permitted

to allow counsel to confer with the accused.

(B) Take such additional steps as may be reasonably practicable to enable

the accused to be informed about the proceedings. Although not required,

technological aids, such as closed-circuit television or audio transmissions,

may be used for this purpose.

(C) Afford the accused a continuing opportunity to return to the courtroom

upon assurance of good behavior. To this end, the accused should be brought

to the courtroom at appropriate intervals, and offered the opportunity to

remain upon good behavior.

(D) Ensure that the reasons for removal appear in the record.

#### (d) Voluntary absence for limited purpose of child testimony.

##### (1) Election by accused.

Following a determination by the military judge that remote live

testimony of a child is appropriate pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 611(d)(3),

the accused may elect to voluntarily absent himself from the courtroom in

order to preclude the use of procedures described in R.C.M. 914A.

##### (2) Procedure.

The accused's absence will be conditional upon his being able to view the witness' testimony from a remote location. Normally, transmission of the testimony will include a system that will transmit the accused's image and voice into the courtroom from a remote location as well as transmission of the child's testimony from the courtroom to the accused's location. A one-way transmission may be used if deemed necessary by the military judge. The accused will also be provided private, contemporaneous communication with his counsel. The procedures described herein shall be employed unless the accused has made a knowing and affirmative waiver of these procedures.

##### (3) Effect on accused's rights generally.

An election by the accused to be absent pursuant to subsection (c)(1)

shall not otherwise affect the accused's right to be present at the remainder

of the trial in accordance with this rule.

#### (e) Appearance and security of accused.

##### (1) Appearance.

The accused shall be properly attired in the uniform or dress prescribed

by the military judge. An accused servicemember shall wear the insignia of

grade and may wear any decorations, emblems, or ribbons to which entitled.

The accused and defense counsel are responsible for ensuring that the accused

is properly attired; however, upon request, the accused's commander shall

render such assistance as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that the

accused is properly attired.

###### Discussion

This subsection recognizes the right, as well as the obligation,

of an accused servicemember to present a good military appearance at trial.

An accused servicemember who refuses to present a proper military appearance

before a court-martial may be compelled to do so.

##### (2) Custody.

Responsibility for maintaining custody or control of an accused

before and during trial may be assigned, subject to R.C.M. 304 and 305, and

subsection (c)(3) of this rule, under such regulations as the Secretary concerned

may prescribe.

##### (3) Restraint.

Physical restraint shall not be imposed on the accused during open

sessions of the court-martial unless prescribed by the military judge.

## Rule 805. Presence of military judge, members, and counsel

### (a) Military judge.

No court-martial proceeding, except the deliberations of the members,

may take place in the absence of the military judge, if detailed. If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions solely, the presence of the military judge at Article 39(a) sessions may be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology.

### (b) Members.

Unless trial is by military judge alone pursuant to a request by

the accused, no court-martial proceeding may take place in the absence of

any detailed member except: Article 39(a) sessions under R.C.M. 803; examination

 of members under R.C.M. 912(d); when the member has been excused under R.C.M.

505 or 912(f); or as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 1102. No general court-martial proceeding requiring the presence of members may be conducted unless at least five members are present, or in capital cases, at least 12 members are present except as provided in R.C.M. 501(a)(1)(B), where 12 members are not reasonably available because of physical conditions or military exigencies. No special court-martial proceeding requiring the presence of members may be conducted unless at least three members are present except as provided in R.C.M. 912(h). Except as provided in R.C.M. 503(a)(2),

when an enlisted accused has requested enlisted members, no proceeding requiring

 the presence of members may be conducted unless at least one-third of the

members actually sitting on the court-martial are enlisted persons.

### (c) Counsel.

As long as at least one qualified counsel for each party is present,

other counsel for each party may be absent from a court-martial session.

An assistant counsel who lacks the qualifications necessary to serve as counsel

for a party may not act at a session in the absence of such qualified counsel. If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions solely, the presence of counsel at Article 39(a) sessions may be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology. At least one qualified defense counsel shall be physically present with the accused.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 504(d) concerning qualifications of

counsel.

  Ordinarily, no court-martial proceeding should

take place if any defense or assistant defense counsel is absent unless the

accused expressly consents to the absence. The military judge may, however

proceed in the absence of one or more defense counsel, without the consent

of the accused, if the military judge finds that, under the circumstances,

a continuance is not warranted and that the accused's right to be adequately

 represented would not be impaired.

  _See_ R.C.M.

502(d)(6) and 505(d)(2) concerning withdrawal or substitution of counsel. _

See_ R.C.M. 506(d) concerning the right of the accused to proceed

without counsel.

### (d) Effect of replacement of member or military judge.

#### (1) Members.

When after presentation of evidence on the merits has begun, a new

member is detailed under R.C.M. 505(c)(2)(B), trial may not proceed unless

the testimony and evidence previously admitted on the merits, if recorded

verbatim, is read to the new member, or, if not recorded verbatim, and in

the absence of a stipulation as to such testimony and evidence, the trial

proceeds as if no evidence has been presented.

##### Discussion

When a new member is detailed, the military judge should give such instructions as may be appropriate. _See also_ R.C.M. 912 concerning voir dire and challenges.

  When the court-martial has been reduced below a quorum, a mistrial may be appropriate. See _R.C.M._ 915.

#### (2) Military judge.

When, after the presentation of evidence on the merits has begun

in trial before military judge alone, a new military judge is detailed under

R.C.M. 505(e)(2) trial may not proceed unless the accused requests, and the

military judge approves, trial by military judge alone, and a verbatim record

of the testimony and evidence or a stipulation thereof is read to the military

judge, or the trial proceeds as if no evidence had been presented.

## Rule 806. Public trial

### (a) In general.

Except as otherwise provided in this rule, courts-martial shall

be open to the public. For purposes of this rule, "public" includes

members of both the military and civilian communities.

#### Discussion

Because of the requirement for public trials, courts-martial must

be conducted in facilities which can accommodate a reasonable number of spectators.

Military exigencies may occasionally make attendance at courts-martial difficult

or impracticable, as, for example, when a court-martial is conducted on a

ship at sea or in a unit in a combat zone. This does not violate this rule.

However, such exigencies should not be manipulated to prevent attendance

at a court-martial. The requirements of this rule may be met even though

only servicemembers are able to attend a court-martial. Although not required,

servicemembers should be encouraged to attend courts-martial.

  When

public access to a court-martial is limited for some reason, including lack

of space, special care must be taken to avoid arbitrary exclusion of specific

groups or persons. This may include allocating a reasonable number of seats

to members of the press and to relatives of the accused, and establishing

procedures for entering and exiting from the courtroom. _See also

_ subsection (b) below. There is no requirement that there actually

be spectators at a court-martial.

  The fact that a trial

is conducted with members does not make it a public trial.

### (b) Control of spectators and closure.

#### (1) Control of spectators.

In order to maintain the dignity and decorum of the proceedings

or for other good cause, the military judge may reasonably limit the number

of spectators in, and the means of access to, the courtroom, and exclude

specific persons from the courtroom. When excluding specific persons, the

military judge must make findings on the record establishing the reason for

the exclusion, the basis for the military judge's belief that exclusion is

necessary, and that the exclusion is as narrowly tailored as possible.

##### Discussion

 The military judge must ensure that the dignity and decorum of the proceedings are maintained and that the other rights and interests of the parties and society are protected. Public access to a session may be limited, specific persons may be excluded from the courtroom, and, under unusual circumstances, a session may be closed.

 Exclusion of specific persons, if unreasonable under the circumstances, may violate the accused's right to a public trial, even though other spectators remain. Whenever specific persons or some members of the public are excluded, exclusion must be limited in time and scope to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is ordered. Prevention of over�

crowding or noise may justify limiting access to the courtroom. Disruptive or distracting appearance or conduct may justify excluding specific persons. Specific persons may be excluded when necessary to protect witnesses from harm or intimidation. Access may be reduced when no other means is available to relieve a witness' inability to testify due to embarrassment or extreme nervousness. Witnesses will ordinarily be excluded from the courtroom so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 615.

 For purposes of this rule, the term "victim of an alleged offense" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ.

#### (2) Right of victim to attend.

A victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused may not be excluded from a court-martial relating to the offense unless the military judge, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that hearing or proceeding. The right to attend requires reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of a court-martial relating to the offense.

#### (3) Right of victim to confer.

 A victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused has the reasonable right to confer with the trial counsel.

#### (4) Closure.

Courts-martial shall be open to the public unless (1) there is a

substantial probability that an overriding interest will be prejudiced if

the proceedings remain open; (2) closure is no broader than necessary to protect

the overriding interest; (3) reasonable alternatives to closure were considered

and found inadequate; and (4) the military judge makes case-specific findings

on the record justifying closure.

#### Discussion

The military judge is responsible for protecting both the accused's

right to, and the public's interest in, a public trial. A court-martial session

is "closed" when no member of the public is permitted to attend.

 A court-martial is not "closed" merely because the exclusion

of certain individuals results in there being no spectators present, as long

as the exclusion is not so broad as to effectively bar everyone who might

attend the sessions and is put into place for a proper purpose.

  A session may be closed over the objection of the accused or the public upon

meeting the constitutional standard set forth in this Rule. _See also

_ Mil. R. Evid. 412(c), 505(i), and 513(e)(2).

  The

accused may waive his right to a public trial. The fact that the prosecution

and defense jointly seek to have a session closed does not, however, automatically

justify closure, for the public has a right in attending courts-martial.

Opening trials to public scrutiny reduces the chance of arbitrary and capricious

decisions and enhances public confidence in the court-martial process.

  The most likely reason for a defense request to close court-martial proceedings

is to minimize the potentially adverse effect of publicity on the trial.

For example, a pretrial Article 39(a) hearing at which the admissibility of

a confession will be litigated may, under some circumstances, be closed, in

accordance with this Rule, in order to prevent disclosure to the public (and

hence to potential members) of the very evidence that may be excluded. When

such publicity may be a problem, a session should be closed only as a last

resort.

  There are alternative means of protecting the

proceedings from harmful effects of publicity, including a thorough _

voir dire_ (_see_ R.C.M. 912), and, if necessary, a

continuance to allow the harmful effects of publicity to dissipate

(_see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(1)). Alternatives that may occasionally be appropriate

and are usually preferable to closing a session include: directing members

not to read, listen to, or watch any accounts concerning the case; issuing

a protective order (_see_ R.C.M. 806(d)); selecting members

from recent arrivals in the command, or from outside the immediate area

(_see_ R.C.M. 503(a)(3)); changing the place of trial

(_see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(11)); or sequestering the members.

### (c) Photography and broadcasting prohibited.

Video and audio recording and the taking of photographs-except

 for the purpose of preparing the record of trial-in the courtroom during

 the proceedings and radio or television broadcasting of proceedings from

the courtroom shall not be permitted. However, the military judge may, as

a matter of discretion permit contemporaneous closed-circuit video or audio

transmission to permit viewing or hearing by an accused removed under R.C.M.

804 or by spectators when courtroom facilities are inadequate to accommodate

a reasonable number of spectators.

### (d) Protective orders.

The military judge may, upon request of any party or _sua

 sponte_, issue an appropriate protective order, in writing, to prevent

parties and witnesses from making extrajudicial statements that present

a substantial likelihood of material prejudice to a fair trial by impartial

 members. For purposes of this subsection, "military judge" does

not include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.

#### Discussion

  A protective order may proscribe extrajudicial statements

 by counsel, parties, and witnesses that might divulge prejudicial matter

not of public record in the case. Other appropriate matters may also be addressed

by such a protective order. Before issuing a protective order, the military

judge must consider whether other available remedies would effectively mitigate

the adverse effects that any publicity might create, and consider such an

order's likely effectiveness in ensuring an impartial court-martial panel.

A military judge should not issue a protective order without first providing

notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard. The military judge

must state on the record the reasons for issuing the protective order. If

the reasons for issuing the order change, the military judge may reconsider

the continued necessity for a protective order.

## Rule 807. Oaths

### (a) Definition.

"Oath" includes "affirmation."

#### Discussion

An affirmation is the same as an oath, except in an affirmation

the words "so help you God" are omitted.

### (b) Oaths in courts-martial.

#### (1) Who must be sworn.

##### (A) Court-martial personnel.

The military judge, members of a general or special court-martial,

 trial counsel, assistant trial counsel, defense counsel, associate defense

 counsel, assistant defense counsel, reporter, interpreter, and escort shall

take an oath to perform their duties faithfully. For purposes of this rule,

 "defense counsel," "associate defense counsel," and

 "assistant defense counsel," include detailed and individual

military and civilian counsel.

###### Discussion

Article 42(a) provides that regulations of the Secretary concerned

 shall prescribe: the form of the oath; the time and place of the taking

 thereof; the manner of recording it; and whether the oath shall be taken

for all cases in which the duties are to be performed or in each case separately.

In the case of certified legal personnel (Article 26(b); Article 27(b)) these

 regulations may provide for the administration of an oath on a one-time

basis. _See also_ R.C.M. 813 and 901 concerning the point

in the proceedings at which it is ordinarily determined whether the required

oaths have been taken or are then administered.

##### (B) Witnesses.

Each witness before a court-martial shall be examined on oath.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 307 concerning the requirement for an oath in preferral of charges. _See_ R.C.M. 405 and 702 concerning the requirements for an oath in Article 32 preliminary hearings and depositions.

 An accused making an unsworn statement is not a "witness." _See_ R.C.M. 1001(c)(2)(C).

 A victim of an offense of which the accused has been found guilty is not a "witness" when making an unsworn statement during the presentencing phase of a court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 1001A.

#### (2) Procedure for administering oaths.

Any procedure which appeals to the conscience of the person to whom

 the oath is administered and which binds that person to speak the truth,

or, in the case of one other than a witness, properly to perform certain

duties, is sufficient.

##### Discussion

When the oath is administered in a session to the military judge,

 members, or any counsel, all persons in the courtroom should stand. In those

rare circumstances in which the trial counsel testifies as a witness, the

military judge administers the oath.

  Unless otherwise prescribed

by the Secretary concerned the forms below may be used, as appropriate,

to administer an oath.

###### (A) Oath for military judge.

When the military judge is not previously sworn, the trial counsel

will administer the following oath to the military judge:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully

 and impartially perform, according to your conscience and the laws applicable

to trial by court-martial, all the duties incumbent upon you as military

judge of this court-martial (,so help you God)?"

###### (B) Oath for members.

The following oath, as appropriate, will be administered to the

members by the trial counsel:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will answer

 truthfully the questions concerning whether you should serve as a member

of this court-martial; that you will faithfully and impartially try, according

 to the evidence, your conscience, and the laws applicable to trial by court-martial,

the case of the accused now before this court; and that you will not disclose

or discover the vote or opinion of any particular member of the court (upon

a challenge or) upon the findings or sentence unless required to do so in

due course of law (,so help you God)?"

###### (C) Oaths for counsel.

When counsel for either side, including any associate or assistant,

is not previously sworn the following oath, as appropriate, will be administered

by the military judge:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully

 perform all the duties of (trial) (assistant trial) (defense)(associate

defense) (assistant defense) counsel in the case now in hearing (,so help

you God)?"

###### (D) Oath for reporter.

The trial counsel will administer the following oath to every reporter

of a court-martial who has not been previously sworn:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully

 perform the duties of reporter to this court-martial (,so help you God)?"

###### (E) Oath for interpreter.

The trial counsel or the summary court-martial shall administer

the following oath to every interpreter in the trial of any case before a

 court-martial:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that in the case now

in hearing you will interpret truly the testimony you are called upon to

interpret (,so help you God)?"

###### (F) Oath for witnesses.

The trial counsel or the summary court-martial will administer

the following oath to each witness before the witness first testifies in

a case:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you

 shall give in the case now in hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth,

and nothing but the truth (,so help you God)?"

###### (G) Oath for escort.

The escort on views or inspections by the court-martial will, before

serving, take the following oath, which will be administered by the trial

counsel:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will escort

the court-martial and will well and truly point out to them (the place in

which the offense charged in this case is alleged to have been committed)

 (); and that you will not speak to the members concerning

(the alleged offense) (), except to describe (the

place aforesaid) () (,so help you God)?"



  _See_ Article 136 concerning persons

 authorized to administer oaths.

## Rule 808. Record of trial

The trial counsel of a general or special court-martial shall take

 such action as may be necessary to ensure that a record which will meet

the requirements of R.C.M. 1103 can be prepared.

### Discussion

Except in a special court-martial not authorized to adjudge a bad-conduct

discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for

more than six months, the trial counsel should ensure that a qualified court

reporter is detailed to the court-martial. Trial counsel should also ensure

that all exhibits and other documents relating to the case are properly maintained

for later inclusion in the record. _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(j)

as to the use of videotapes, audiotapes, and similar recordings for the record

of trial. Because of the potential requirement for a verbatim transcript,

all proceedings, including sidebar conferences, arguments, and rulings and

instructions by the military judge, should be recorded.

  Where

there is recorder failure or loss of court reporter's notes, the record should

be reconstructed as completely as possible. _See also_ R.C.M.

1103(f). If the interruption is discovered during trial, the military judge

should summarize or reconstruct the portion of the proceedings which has

not been recorded and then proceed anew and repeat the proceedings from the

## Rule 809. Contempt proceedings

### (a) In general.

Courts-martial may exercise contempt power under Article 48.

#### Discussion

 Article 48 makes punishable "direct" contempt, as well as "indirect" or "constructive" contempt. "Direct" contempt is that which is committed in the presence of the court-martial or its immediate proximity. "Presence" includes those places outside the courtroom itself, such as waiting areas, deliberation rooms, and other places set aside for the use of the court-martial while it is in session. "Indirect" or "constructive" contempt is non-compliance with lawful writs, processes, orders, rules, decrees, or commands of the court-martial. A "direct" or "indirect" contempt may be actually seen or heard by the court-martial, in which case it may be punished summarily. _See_ subsection (b)(1) below. A "direct" or "indirect" contempt may also be a contempt not actually observed by the court-martial, for example, when an unseen person makes loud noises, whether inside or outside the courtroom, which impede the orderly progress of the proceedings. In such a case the procedures for punishing for contempt are more extensive. _See_ subsection (b)(2) below.

 The words "any person," as used in Article 48, include all persons, whether or not subject to military law, except the military judge, members, and foreign nationals outside the territorial limits of the United States who are not subject to the code. The military judge may order the offender removed whether or not contempt proceedings are held. It may be appropriate to warn a person whose conduct is improper that persistence in a course of behavior may result in removal or punishment for contempt. _See_ R.C.M. 804, 806.

 Each contempt may be separately punished.

 A person subject to the code who commits contempt may be tried by court-martial or otherwise disciplined under Article 134 for such misconduct in addition to or instead of punishment for contempt. _See_ paragraph 108, Part IV; _see also_ Article 98. The 2011 amendment of Article 48 expanded the contempt power of military courts to enable them to enforce orders, such as discovery orders or protective orders regarding evidence, against military or civilian attorneys. Persons not subject to military jurisdiction under Article 2, having been duly subpoenaed, may be prosecuted in Federal civilian court under Article 47 for neglect or refusal to appear or refusal to qualify as a witness or to testify or to produce evidence.

### (b) Method of disposition.

#### (1) Summary disposition.

When conduct constituting contempt is directly witnessed by the

 court-martial, the conduct may be punished summarily.

#### (2) Disposition upon notice and hearing.

When the conduct apparently constituting contempt is not directly

 witnessed by the court-martial, the alleged offender shall be brought before

the court-martial and informed orally or in writing of the alleged contempt.

 The alleged offender shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present

evidence, including calling witnesses. The alleged offender shall have the

right to be represented by counsel and shall be so advised. The contempt

must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before it may be punished.

### (c) Procedure.

The military judge shall in all cases determine whether to punish

for contempt and, if so, what the punishment shall be. The military judge

shall also determine when during the court-martial the contempt proceedings

shall be conducted; however, if the court-martial is composed of members,

the military judge shall conduct the contempt proceedings outside the members'

presence. The military judge may punish summarily under subsection (b)(1)

only if the military judge recites the facts for the record and states that

they were directly witnessed by the military judge in the actual presence

of the court-martial. Otherwise, the provisions of subsection (b)(2) shall

apply.

### (d) Record; review.

A record of the contempt proceedings shall be part of the record

of the court-martial during which it occurred. If the person was held in

contempt, then a separate record of the contempt proceedings shall be prepared

and forwarded to the convening authority for review. The convening authority

may approve or disapprove all or part of the sentence. The action of the

convening authority is not subject to further review or appeal.

### (e) Sentence.

A sentence of confinement pursuant to a finding of contempt shall

 begin to run when it is adjudged unless deferred, suspended, or disapproved

by the convening authority. The place of confinement for a civilian or military

person who is held in contempt and is to be punished by confinement shall

be designated by the convening authority. A fine does not become effective

until ordered executed by the convening authority. The military judge may

delay announcing the sentence after a finding of contempt to permit the person

involved to continue to participate in the proceedings.

#### Discussion

The immediate commander of the person held in contempt, or, in the

 case of a civilian, the convening authority should be notified immediately

so that the necessary action on the sentence may be taken. _See_

R.C.M. 1101.

### (f) Informing person held in contempt.

The person held in contempt shall be informed by the convening

authority in writing of the holding and sentence, if any, of the court-martial

and of the action of the convening authority upon the sentence.

#### Discussion

Copies of this communication should be furnished to such other

persons including the immediate commander of the offender as may be concerned

with the execution of the punishment. A copy shall be included with the

record of both the trial and the contempt proceeding.

## Rule 810. Procedures for rehearings, new trials, and other trials

### (a) In general.

#### (1) Rehearings in full and new or other trials.

In rehearings which require findings on all charges and specifications

referred to a court-martial and in new or other trials, the procedure shall

be the same as in an original trial except as otherwise provided in this

rule.

#### (2) Rehearings on sentence only.

In a rehearing on sentence only, the procedure shall be the same

as in an original trial, except that the portion of the procedure which

ordinarily occurs after challenges and through and including the findings

 is omitted, and except as otherwise provided in this rule.

##### (A) Contents of the record.

The contents of the record of the original trial consisting of

evidence properly admitted on the merits relating to each offense of which

the accused stands convicted but not sentenced may be established by any

party whether or not testimony so read is otherwise admissible under Mil.

R. Evid. 804(b)(1) and whether or not it was given through an interpreter.

###### Discussion

Matters excluded from the record of the original trial on the merits

 or improperly admitted on the merits must not be brought to the attention

of the members as a part of the original record of trial.

##### (B) Plea.

The accused at a rehearing only on sentence may not withdraw any

plea of guilty upon which findings of guilty are based. However, if such

a plea is found to be improvident, the rehearing shall be suspended and the

matter reported to the authority ordering the rehearing.

#### (3) Combined rehearings.

When a rehearing on sentence is combined with a trial on the merits

 of one or more specifications referred to the court-martial, whether or

not such specifications are being tried for the first time or reheard, the

trial will proceed first on the merits, without reference to the offenses

being reheard on sentence only. After findings on the merits are announced,

the members, if any, shall be advised of the offenses on which the rehearing

on sentence has been directed. Additional challenges for cause may be permitted,

and the sentencing procedure shall be the same as at an original trial,

except as otherwise provided in this rule. A single sentence shall be adjudged

for all offenses.

### (b) Composition.

#### (1) Members.

No member of the court-martial which previously heard the case may

 sit as a member of the court-martial at any rehearing, new trial, or other

trial of the same case.

#### (2) Military judge.

The military judge at a rehearing may be the same military judge

who presided over a previous trial of the same case. The existence or absence

of a request for trial by military judge alone at a previous hearing shall

have no effect on the composition of a court-martial on rehearing.

#### (3) Accused's election.

The accused at a rehearing or new or other trial shall have the

same right to request enlisted members or trial by military judge alone

as the accused would have at an original trial.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 902; 903.

### (c) Examination of record of former proceedings.

No member may, upon a rehearing or upon a new or other trial, examine

the record of any former proceedings in the same case except:

(1) When permitted to do so by the military judge after such matters

have been received in evidence; or

(2) That the president of a special court-martial without a military

judge may examine that part of the record of former proceedings which relates

to errors committed at the former proceedings when necessary to decide the

admissibility of offered evidence or other questions of law, and such a part

of the record may be read to the members when necessary for them to consider

a matter subject to objection by any member.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(2).

  When a

rehearing is ordered, the trial counsel should be provided a record of the

former proceedings, accompanying documents, and any decision or review relating

to the case, as well as a statement of the reason for the rehearing.

### (d) Sentence limitations.

#### (1) In general.

Sentences at rehearings, new trials, or other trials shall be adjudged

within the limitations set forth in R.C.M. 1003. Except as otherwise provided

in subsection (d)(2) of this rule, offenses on which a rehearing, new trial,

or other trial has been ordered shall not be the basis for an approved sentence

in excess of or more severe than the sentence ultimately approved by the

convening or higher authority following the previous trial or hearing, unless

the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. When a rehearing or

sentencing is combined with trial on new charges, the maximum punishment that

may be approved by the convening authority shall be the maximum punishment

under R.C.M. 1003 for the offenses being reheard as limited above, plus the

total maximum punishment under R.C.M. 1003 for any new charges of which the

accused has been found guilty.  In the case of an "other trial"

no sentence limitations apply if the original trial was invalid because a

summary or special court-martial improperly tried an offense involving a mandatory

punishment or one otherwise considered capital.

##### Discussion

At a rehearing, the trier of fact is not bound by the sentence previously adjudged or approved.  The members should not be advised of the sentence limitation under this rule.  See R.C.M. 1005(e)(1).  An appropriate sentence on a retried or reheard offense should be adjudged without regard to any credit to which the accused may be entitled.  See R.C.M. 103(2) and R.C.M. 103(3) as to when a rehearing may be a capital case.

#### (2) Pretrial agreement.

If, after the earlier court-martial, the sentence was approved in

accordance with a pretrial agreement and at the rehearing the accused fails

to comply with the pretrial agreement, by failing to enter a plea of guilty

or otherwise, the approved sentence resulting at a rehearing of the affected

charges and specifications may include any otherwise lawful punishment not

in excess of or more serious than lawfully adjudged at the earlier court-martial.

### (e) Definition.

"Other trial" means another trial of a case in which

the original proceedings were declared invalid because of lack of jurisdiction

or failure of a charge to state an offense.

## Rule 811. Stipulations

### (a) In general.

The parties may make an oral or written stipulation to any fact,

the contents of a document, or the expected testimony of a witness.

### (b) Authority to reject.

The military judge may, in the interest of justice, decline to accept

 a stipulation.

#### Discussion

Although the decision to stipulate should ordinarily be left to

the parties, the military judge should not accept a stipulation if there

is any doubt of the accused's or any other party's understanding of the

nature and effect of the stipulation. The military judge should also refuse

to accept a stipulation which is unclear or ambiguous. A stipulation of fact

which amounts to a complete defense to any offense charged should not be

accepted nor, if a plea of not guilty is outstanding, should one which practically

amounts to a confession, except as described in the discussion under subsection

(c) of this rule. If a stipulation is rejected, the parties may be entitled

to a continuance.

### (c) Requirements.

Before accepting a stipulation in evidence, the military judge must

be satisfied that the parties consent to its admission.

#### Discussion

Ordinarily, before accepting any stipulation the military judge

should inquire to ensure that the accused understands the right not to stipulate,

understands the stipulation, and consents to it.

  If the

stipulation practically amounts to a confession to an offense to which a not

guilty plea is outstanding, it may not be accepted unless the military judge

ascertains: (A) from the accused that the accused understands the right not

to stipulate and that the stipulation will not be accepted without the accused's

consent; that the accused understands the contents and effect of the stipulation;

that a factual basis exists for the stipulation; and that the accused, after

consulting with counsel, consents to the stipulation; and (B) from the accused

and counsel for each party whether there are any agreements between the parties

in connection with the stipulation, and, if so, what the terms of such agreements

are.

  A stipulation practically amounts to a confession when

it is the equivalent of a guilty plea, that is, when it establishes, directly

or by reasonable inference, every element of a charged offense and when the

defense does not present evidence to contest any potential remaining issue

of the merits. Thus, a stipulation which tends to establish, by reasonable

inference, every element of a charged offense does not practically amount

to a confession if the defense contests an issue going to guilt which is not

foreclosed by the stipulation. For example, a stipulation of fact that contraband

drugs were discovered in a vehicle owned by the accused would normally practically

amount to a confession if no other evidence were presented on the issue,

but would not if the defense presented evidence to show that the accused was

unaware of the presence of the drugs. Whenever a stipulation establishes

the elements of a charged offense, the military judge should conduct an inquiry

as described above.

  If, during an inquiry into a confessional

stipulation the military judge discovers that there is a pretrial agreement,

the military judge must conduct an inquiry into the pretrial agreement. _

See_ R.C.M. 910(f). _See also_ R.C.M. 705.

### (d) Withdrawal.

A party may withdraw from an agreement to stipulate or from a stipulation

at any time before a stipulation is accepted; the stipulation may not then

be accepted. After a stipulation has been accepted a party may withdraw

from it only if permitted to do so in the discretion of the military judge.

#### Discussion

If a party withdraws from an agreement to stipulate or from a stipulation,

before or after it has been accepted, the opposing party may be entitled

to a continuance to obtain proof of the matters which were to have been

stipulated.

  If a party is permitted to withdraw from a stipulation

 previously accepted, the stipulation must be disregarded by the court-martial,

and an instruction to that effect should be given.

### (e) Effect of stipulation.

Unless properly withdrawn or ordered stricken from the record, a

 stipulation of fact that has been accepted is binding on the court-martial

and may not be contradicted by the parties thereto. The contents of a stipulation

of expected testimony or of a document's contents may be attacked, contradicted,

or explained in the same way as if the witness had actually so testified

or the document had been actually admitted. The fact that the parties so

stipulated does not admit the truth of the indicated testimony or document's

contents, nor does it add anything to the evidentiary nature of the testimony

or document. The Military Rules of Evidence apply to the contents of stipulations.

### (f) Procedure.

When offered, a written stipulation shall be presented to the military

judge and shall be included in the record whether accepted or not. Once accepted,

a written stipulation of expected testimony shall be read to the members,

if any, but shall not be presented to them; a written stipulation of fact

or of a document's contents may be read to the members, if any, presented

to them, or both. Once accepted, an oral stipulation shall be announced

to the members, if any.

## Rule 812. Joint and common trials

In joint trials and in common trials, each accused shall be accorded

 the rights and privileges as if tried separately.

### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5) concerning preparing charges

and specifications for joint trials. _See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(3)

concerning referral of charges for joint or common trials, and the distinction

 between the two. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(9) concerning motions

to sever and other appropriate motions in joint or common trials.

  In

a joint or common trial, each accused may be represented by separate counsel,

make challenges for cause, make peremptory challenges (_see_ R.C.M.

912), cross-examine witnesses, elect whether to testify, introduce evidence,

request that the membership of the court include enlisted persons, if an

enlisted accused, and, if a military judge has been detailed, request trial

by military judge alone.

  Where different elections are made

(and, when necessary, approved) as to court-martial composition a severance

is necessary. Thus, if one co-accused elects to be tried by a court-martial

composed of officers, and a second requests that enlisted members be detailed

to the court, and a third submits a request for trial by military judge

alone, which request is approved, three separate trials must be conducted.

  In

a joint or common trial, evidence which is admissible against only one or

some of the joint or several accused may be considered only against the accused

concerned. For example, when a stipulation is accepted which was made by

only one or some of the accused, the stipulation does not apply to those

accused who did not join it. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 306.

In such instances the members must be instructed that the stipulation or

evidence may be considered only with respect to the accused with respect

to whom it is accepted.

## Rule 813. Announcing personnel of the court-martial and accused

### (a) Opening sessions.

When the court-martial is called to order for the first time in

a case, the military judge shall ensure that the following is announced:

(1) The order, including any amendment, by which the court-martial is

 convened;

(2) The name, rank, and unit or address of the accused;

(3) The name and rank of the military judge, if one has been detailed;

(4) The names and ranks of the members, if any, who are present;

(5) The names and ranks of members who are absent, if presence of members

 is required;

(6) The names and ranks (if any) of counsel who are present;

(7) The names and ranks (if any) of counsel who are absent; and

(8) The name and rank (if any) of any detailed court reporter.

### (b) Later proceedings.

When the court-martial is called to order after a recess or adjournment

or after it has been closed for any reason, the military judge shall ensure

that the record reflects whether all parties and members who were present

at the time of the adjournment or recess, or at the time the court-martial

 closed, are present.

### (c) Additions, replacement, and absences of personnel.

Whenever there is a replacement of the military judge, any member,

or counsel, either through the appearance of new personnel or personnel

previously absent or through the absence of personnel previously present,

the military judge shall ensure the record reflects the change and the reason

for it.

# CHAPTER IX. TRIAL PROCEDURES THROUGH FINDINGS

## Rule 901. Opening session

### (a) Call to order.

A court-martial is in session when the military judge so declares.

#### Discussion

The military judge should examine the charge sheet, convening order,

 and any amending orders before calling the initial session to order.

  Article

35 provides that in time of peace, no proceedings, including Article 39(a)

 sessions, may be conducted over the accused's objection until five days have

 elapsed from the service of charges on the accused in the case of a general

court-martial. The period is three days for a special court-martial. In

computing these periods, the date of service and the date of the proceedings

 are excluded. Holidays and Sundays are not excluded. Failure to object waives

 the right to the waiting period, but if it appears that the waiting period

has not elapsed, the military judge should bring this to the attention of

the defense and secure an affirmative waiver on the record.

### (b) Announcement of parties.

After the court-martial is called to order, the presence or absence

 of the parties, military judge, and members shall be announced.

#### Discussion

If the orders detailing the military judge and counsel have not

been reduced to writing, an oral announcement of such detailing is required. _

See_ R.C.M. 503(b) and (c).

### (c) Swearing reporter and interpreter.

After the personnel have been accounted for as required in subsection

 (b) of this rule, the trial counsel shall announce whether the reporter

and interpreter, if any is present, have been properly sworn. If not sworn,

the reporter and interpreter, if any, shall be sworn.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 807 concerning the oath to be administered

to a court reporter or interpreter. If a reporter or interpreter is replaced

at any time during trial, this should be noted for the record, and the procedures

in this subsection should be repeated.

### (d) Counsel.

#### (1) Trial counsel.

The trial counsel shall announce the legal qualifications and status

 as to oaths of the members of the prosecution and whether any member of

the prosecution has acted in any manner which might tend to disqualify that

counsel.

#### (2) Defense counsel.

The detailed defense counsel shall announce the legal qualifications

 and status as to oaths of the detailed members of the defense and whether

any member of the defense has acted in any manner which might tend to disqualify

that counsel. Any defense counsel not detailed shall state that counsel's

legal qualifications, and whether that counsel has acted in any manner which

might tend to disqualify the counsel.

#### (3) Disqualification.

If it appears that any counsel may be disqualified, the military

 judge shall decide the matter and take appropriate action.

##### Discussion

Counsel may be disqualified because of lack of necessary qualifications,

or because of duties or actions which are inconsistent with the role of counsel. _

See_ R.C.M. 502(d) concerning qualifications of counsel.

  If

it appears that any counsel may be disqualified, the military judge should

conduct an inquiry or hearing. If any detailed counsel is disqualified, the

 appropriate authority should be informed. If any defense counsel is disqualified,

the accused should be so informed.

  If the disqualification

of trial or defense counsel is one which the accused may waive, the accused

should be so informed by the military judge, and given the opportunity to

decide whether to waive the disqualification. In the case of defense counsel,

if the disqualification is not waivable or if the accused elects not to

waive the disqualification, the accused should be informed of the choices

available and given the opportunity to exercise such options.

  If

any counsel is disqualified, the military judge should ensure that the accused

is not prejudiced by any actions of the disqualified counsel or any break

in representation of the accused.

  Disqualification of counsel

is not a jurisdictional defect; such error must be tested for prejudice.

  If

the membership of the prosecution or defense changes at any time during the

proceedings, the procedures in this subsection should be repeated as to the

new counsel. In addition, the military judge should ascertain on the record

whether the accused objects to a change of defense counsel. _See_

R.C.M. 505(d)(2) and 506(c).

#### (4) Inquiry.

 The military judge shall, in open session:

(A) Inform the accused of the rights to be represented by military

counsel detailed to the defense; or by individual military counsel requested

by the accused, if such military counsel is reasonably available; and by

civilian counsel, either alone or in association with military counsel, if

such civilian counsel is provided at no expense to the United States;

(B) Inform the accused that, if afforded individual military counsel,

the accused may request retention of detailed counsel as associate counsel,

which request may be granted or denied in the sole discretion of the authority

who detailed the counsel;

(C) Ascertain from the accused whether the accused understands these

 rights;

(D) Promptly inquire, whenever two or more accused in a joint or common

 trial are represented by the same detailed or individual military or civilian

counsel, or by civilian counsel who are associated in the practice of law,

with respect to such joint representation and shall personally advise each

accused of the right to effective assistance of counsel, including separate

representation. Unless it appears that there is good cause to believe no

conflict of interest is likely to arise, the military judge shall take appropriate

 measures to protect each accused's right to counsel; and

###### Discussion

Whenever it appears that any defense counsel may face a conflict

of interest, the military judge should inquire into the matter, advise the

accused of the right to effective assistance of counsel, and ascertain the

accused's choice of counsel. When defense counsel is aware of a potential

conflict of interest, counsel should discuss the matter with the accused.

If the accused elects to waive such conflict, counsel should inform the

military judge of the matter at an Article 39(a) session so that an appropriate

record can be made.

(E) Ascertain from the accused by whom the accused chooses to be represented.

#### (5) Unsworn counsel.

The military judge shall administer the oath to any counsel not

 sworn.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 807.

### (e) Presence of members.

In cases in which a military judge has been detailed, the procedures

 described in R.C.M. 901 through 903, 904 when authorized by the Secretary

concerned, and 905 through 910 shall be conducted without members present

in accordance with R.C.M. 803.

## Rule 902. Disqualification of military judge

### (a) In general.

Except as provided in subsection (e) of this rule, a military judge

 shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which that military

judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

### (b) Specific grounds.

A military judge shall also disqualify himself or herself in the

 following circumstances:

(1) Where the military judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning

 a party or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the

proceeding.

(2) Where the military judge has acted as counsel, preliminary hearing officer,

legal officer, staff judge advocate, or convening authority as to any offense

charged or in the same case generally.

(3) Where the military judge has been or will be a witness in the same

case, is the accuser, has forwarded charges in the case with a personal recommendation

as to disposition, or, except in the performance of duties as military judge

in a previous trial of the same or a related case, has expressed an opinion

 concerning the guilt or innocence of the accused.

(4) Where the military judge is not eligible to act because the military

 judge is not qualified under R.C.M. 502(c) or not detailed under R.C.M.

503(b).

(5) Where the military judge, the military judge's spouse, or a person

 within the third degree of relationship to either of them or a spouse of

such person:

(A) Is a party to the proceeding;

(B) Is known by the military judge to have an interest, financial or

 otherwise, that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;

or

(C) Is to the military judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness

 in the proceeding.

###### Discussion

A military judge should inform himself or herself about his or her

 financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself or herself

about the financial interests of his or her spouse and minor children living

in his or her household.

### (c) Definitions.

For the purposes of this rule the following words or phrases shall

 have the meaning indicated-

(1) "Proceeding" includes pretrial, trial, post-trial,

appellate review, or other stages of litigation.

(2) The "degree of relationship" is calculated according

to the civil law system.

##### Discussion

Relatives within the third degree of relationship are children,

 grandchildren, great grandchildren, parents, grandparents, great grandparents,

brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces.

(3) "Military judge" does not include the president of a

 special court-martial without a military judge.

### (d) Procedure.

(1) The military judge shall, upon motion of any party or _sua

 sponte_, decide whether the military judge is disqualified.

##### Discussion

There is no peremptory challenge against a military judge. A military

 judge should carefully consider whether any of the grounds for disqualification

in this rule exist in each case. The military judge should broadly construe

grounds for challenge but should not step down from a case unnecessarily.

  Possible

grounds for disqualification should be raised at the earliest reasonable

opportunity. They may be raised at any time, and an earlier adverse ruling

does not bar later consideration of the same issue, as, for example, when

additional evidence is discovered.

(2) Each party shall be permitted to question the military judge and

to present evidence regarding a possible ground for disqualification before

the military judge decides the matter.

##### Discussion

Nothing in this rule prohibits the military judge from reasonably

 limiting the presentation of evidence, the scope of questioning, and argument

on the subject so as to ensure that only matters material to the central

issue of the military judge's possible disqualification are considered, thereby,

preventing the proceedings from becoming a forum for unfounded opinion, speculation

or innuendo.

(3) Except as provided under subsection (e) of this rule, if the military

 judge rules that the military judge is disqualified, the military judge

shall recuse himself or herself.

### (e) Waiver.

No military judge shall accept from the parties to the proceeding

a waiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in subsection (b)

of this rule. Where the ground for disqualification arises only under subsection

(a) of this rule, waiver may be accepted provided it is preceded by a full

disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification.

## Rule 903. Accused's elections on composition of court-martial

### (a) Time of elections.

#### (1) Request for enlisted members.

Before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session or, in the

absence of such a session, before assembly, the military judge shall ascertain,

as applicable, whether an enlisted accused elects to be tried by a court-martial

including enlisted members. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion,

permit the accused to defer requesting enlisted members until any time before

 assembly, which time may be determined by the military judge.

#### (2) Request for trial by military judge alone.

Before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session, or, in the

 absence of such a session, before assembly, the military judge shall ascertain,

as applicable, whether in a noncapital case, the accused requests trial

by the military judge alone. The accused may defer requesting trial by military

judge alone until any time before assembly.

##### Discussion

Only an enlisted accused may request that enlisted members be detailed

to a court-martial. Trial by military judge alone is not permitted in capital

cases (_see_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(C)) or in special courts-martial

in which no military judge has been detailed.

### (b) Form of election.

#### (1) Request for enlisted members.

A request for the membership of the court-martial to include enlisted

 persons shall be in writing and signed by the accused or shall be made orally

on the record.

#### (2) Request for trial by military judge alone.

A request for trial by military judge alone shall be in writing

and signed by the accused or shall be made orally on the record.

### (c) Action on election.

#### (1) Request for enlisted members.

Upon notice of a timely request for enlisted members by an enlisted

 accused, the convening authority shall detail enlisted members to the court-martial

in accordance with R.C.M. 503 or prepare a detailed written statement explaining

why physical conditions or military exigencies prevented this. The trial

of the general issue shall not proceed until this is done.

#### (2) Request for military judge alone.

Upon receipt of a timely request for trial by military judge alone

 the military judge shall:

(A) Ascertain whether the accused has consulted with defense counsel

and has been informed of the identity of the military judge and of the right

to trial by members; and

###### Discussion

Ordinarily the military judge should inquire personally of the accused

to ensure that the accused's waiver of the right to trial by members is knowing

and understanding. Failure to do so is not error, however, where such knowledge

and understanding otherwise appear on the record.

  DD Form

1722 (Request for Trial Before Military Judge Alone (Art.16, UCMJ)) should

normally be used for the purpose of requesting trial by military judge alone

under this rule, if a written request is used.

(B) Approve or disapprove the request, in the military judge's discretion.

###### Discussion

A timely request for trial by military judge alone should be granted

 unless there is substantial reason why, in the interest of justice, the

military judge should not sit as factfinder. The military judge may hear

arguments from counsel before acting on the request. The basis for denial

of a request must be made a matter of record.

#### (3) Other.

In the absence of a request for enlisted members or a request for

 trial by military judge alone, trial shall be by a court-martial composed

of officers.

##### Discussion

Ordinarily if no request for enlisted members or trial by military

 judge alone is submitted, the military judge should inquire whether such

a request will be made (_see_ subsection (a)(1) of this rule)

unless these elections are not available to the accused.

### (d) Right to withdraw request.

#### (1) Enlisted members.

A request for enlisted members may be withdrawn by the accused as

a matter of right any time before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session,

 or, in the absence of such a session, before assembly.

#### (2) Military judge.

A request for trial by military judge alone may be withdrawn by

the accused as a matter of right any time before it is approved, or even

after approval, if there is a change of the military judge.

##### Discussion

Withdrawal of a request for enlisted members or trial by military

 judge alone should be shown in the record.

### (e) Untimely requests.

Failure to request, or failure to withdraw a request for enlisted

members or trial by military judge alone in a timely manner shall waive the

right to submit or to withdraw such a request. However, the military judge

may until the beginning of the introduction of evidence on the merits, as

a matter of discretion, approve an untimely request or withdrawal of a request.

#### Discussion

In exercising discretion whether to approve an untimely request

or withdrawal of a request, the military judge should balance the reason

for the request (for example, whether it is a mere change of tactics or results

from a substantial change of circumstances) against any expense, delay, or

inconvenience which would result from granting the request.

### (f) Scope.

For purposes of this rule, "military judge" does not

 include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.

## Rule 904. Arraignment

Arraignment shall be conducted in a court-martial session and shall

 consist of reading the charges and specifications to the accused and calling

on the accused to plead. The accused may waive the reading.

### Discussion

Arraignment is complete when the accused is called upon to plead;

the entry of pleas is not part of the arraignment.

  When

authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, the arraignment should

be conducted at an Article 39(a) session when a military judge has been detailed.

 The accused may not be arraigned at a conference under R.C.M. 802.

  Once

the accused has been arraigned, no additional charges against that accused

may be referred to that court-martial for trial with the previously referred

charges. _ See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2).

  The defense

should be asked whether it has any motions to make before pleas are entered.

Some motions ordinarily must be made before a plea is entered. _ See

_ R.C.M. 905(b).

## Rule 905. Motions generally

### (a) Definitions and form.

A motion is an application to the military judge for particular

 relief. Motions may be oral or, at the discretion of the military judge,

 written. A motion shall state the grounds upon which it is made and shall

set forth the ruling or relief sought. The substance of a motion, not its

form or designation, shall control.

#### Discussion

Motions may be motions to suppress [(_see_ R.C.M.

 905(b)(3))]; motions for appropriate relief (_see_ R.C.M.

 906); motions to dismiss (_see_ R.C.M. 907); or motions for

findings of not guilty (_see_ R.C.M. 917).

### (b) Pretrial motions.

Any defense, objection, or request which is capable of determination

 without the trial of the general issue of guilt may be raised before trial.

The following must be raised before a plea is entered:

(1) Defenses or objections based on defects (other than jurisdictional

 defects) in the preferral, forwarding, investigation, or referral of charges;

##### Discussion

Such nonjurisdictional defects include unsworn charges, inadequate

 Article 32 preliminary hearing, and inadequate pretrial advice. _See_

R.C.M. 307; 401-407; 601-604.

(2) Defenses or objections based on defects in the charges and specifications

(other than any failure to show jurisdiction or to charge an offense, which

objections shall be resolved by the military judge at any time during the

pendency of the proceedings);

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 307; 906(b)(3).

(3) Motions to suppress evidence;

##### Discussion

Mil. R. Evid. 304(d), 311(d), and 321(c) deal with the admissibility

 of confessions and admissions, evidence obtained from unlawful searches

and seizures, and eyewitness identification, respectively. Questions concerning

the admissibility of evidence on other grounds may be raised by objection

at trial or by motions _in limine_. _ See_ R.C.M.

906(b)(13); Mil. R. Evid. 103(c); 104(a) and (c).

(4) Motions for discovery under R.C.M. 701 or for production of witnesses

 or evidence;

##### Discussion

 _See_ also R.C.M. 703; 1001(e).

(5) Motions for severance of charges or accused; or

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 812; 906(b)(9) and (10).

(6) Objections based on denial of request for individual military counsel

or for retention of detailed defense counsel when individual military counsel

has been granted.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 506(b); 906(b)(2).

### (c) Burden of proof.

#### (1) Standard.

Unless otherwise provided in this Manual, the burden of proof on

any factual issue the resolution of which is necessary to decide a motion

shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.

##### Discussion

_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 104(a) concerning the applicability

of the Military Rules of Evidence to certain preliminary questions.

#### (2) Assignment.

(A) Except as otherwise provided in this Manual the burden of persuasion

 on any factual issue the resolution of which is necessary to decide a motion

shall be on the moving party.

###### Discussion

 _See_, for example, subsection (c)(2)(B) of this

rule, R.C.M. 908 and Mil. R. Evid. 304(e), 311(e), and 321(d) for provisions

specifically assigning the burden of proof.

(B) In the case of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, denial

 of the right to speedy trial under R.C.M. 707, or the running of the statute

of limitations, the burden of persuasion shall be upon the prosecution.

### (d) Ruling on motions.

A motion made before pleas are entered shall be determined before

 pleas are entered unless, if otherwise not prohibited by this Manual, the

military judge for good cause orders that determination be deferred until

 trial of the general issue or after findings, but no such determination shall

 be deferred if a party's right to review or appeal is adversely affected.

Where factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the military

judge shall state the essential findings on the record.

#### Discussion

When trial cannot proceed further as the result of dismissal or

other rulings on motions, the court-martial should adjourn and a record of

the proceedings should be prepared for the convening authority. _See

_ R.C.M. 908(b)(4) regarding automatic stay of certain rulings and

orders subject to appeal under that rule. Notwithstanding the dismissal of

some specifications, trial may proceed in the normal manner as long as one

 or more charges and specifications remain. The promulgating orders should

reflect the action taken by the court-martial on each charge and specification,

including any which were dismissed by the military judge on a motion. _

See_ R.C.M. 1114.

### (e) Effect of failure to raise defenses or objections.

Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make motions

or requests which must be made before pleas are entered under subsection

(b) of this rule shall constitute waiver. The military judge for good cause

shown may grant relief from the waiver. Other motions, requests, defenses,

or objections, except lack of jurisdiction or failure of a charge to allege

an offense, must be raised before the court-martial is adjourned for that

case and, unless otherwise provided in this Manual, failure to do so shall

constitute waiver.

#### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 910(j) concerning matters waived

by a plea of guilty.

### (f) Reconsideration.

On request of any party or _sua sponte_, the military

 judge may, prior to authentication of the record of trial, reconsider any

ruling, other than one amounting to a finding of not guilty, made by the

military judge.

#### Discussion

Subsection (f) permits the military judge to reconsider any ruling

 that affects the legal sufficiency of any finding of guilt or the sentence. _

See_ R.C.M. 917(d) for the standard to be used to determine the

legal sufficiency of evidence. _See also_ R.C.M. 1102 concerning

 procedures for post-trial reconsideration. Different standards may apply

 depending on the nature of the ruling. _See United States v. Scaff

_, 29 M.J. 60 (C.M.A. 1989).

### (g) Effect of final determinations.

Any matter put in issue and finally determined by a court-martial,

 reviewing authority, or appellate court which had jurisdiction to determine

the matter may not be disputed by the United States in any other court-martial

of the same accused, except that, when the offenses charged at one court-martial

did not arise out of the same transaction as those charged at the court-martial

at which the determination was made, a determination of law and the application

of law to the facts may be disputed by the United States. This rule also

shall apply to matters which were put in issue and finally determined in

any other judicial proceeding in which the accused and the United States

or a Federal governmental unit were parties.

#### Discussion

 _See_ also R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Whether a matter

has been finally determined in another judicial proceeding with jurisdiction

to decide it, and whether such determination binds the United States in

another proceeding are interlocutory questions. _See_ R.C.M.

 801(e). It does not matter whether the earlier proceeding ended in an acquittal,

conviction, or otherwise, as long as the determination is final. Except

for a ruling which is, or amounts to, a finding of not guilty, a ruling ordinarily

is not final until action on the court-martial is completed. _See

_ Article 76; R.C.M. 1209. The accused is not bound in a court-martial

by rulings in another court-martial. _But see_ Article 3(b);

R.C.M. 202.

  The determination must have been made by a court-martial,

 reviewing authority, or appellate court, or by another judicial body, such

as a United States court. A pretrial determination by a convening authority

is not a final determination under this rule, although some decisions by

a convening authority may bind the Government under other rules. _

See_, for example, R.C.M. 601, 604, 704, 705.

  The

United States is bound by a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction

 even if the earlier determination is erroneous, except when the offenses

 charged at the second proceeding arose out of a different transaction from

those charged at the first and the ruling at the first proceeding was based

on an incorrect determination of law.

  A final determination

in one case may be the basis for a motion to dismiss or a motion for appropriate

relief in another case, depending on the circumstances. The nature of the

earlier determination and the grounds for it will determine its effect in

other proceedings.

  Examples:

(1) The military judge dismissed a charge for lack of personal jurisdiction,

 on grounds that the accused was only 16 years old at the time of enlistment

 and when the offenses occurred. At a second court-martial of the same accused

for a different offense, the determination in the first case would require

dismissal of the new charge unless the prosecution could show that since

that determination the accused had effected a valid enlistment or constructive

enlistment. _See_ R.C.M. 202. Note, however, that if the

initial ruling had been based on an error of law (for example, if the military

judge had ruled the enlistment invalid because the accused was 18 at the

time of enlistment) this would not require dismissal in the second court-martial

for a different offense.

(2) The accused was tried in United States district court for assault

on a Federal officer. The accused defended solely on the basis of alibi

and was acquitted. The accused is then charged in a court-martial with assault

on a different person at the same time and place as the assault on a Federal

 officer was alleged to have occurred. The acquittal of the accused in Federal

 district court would bar conviction of the accused in the court-martial.

In cases of this nature, the facts of the first trial must be examined to

determine whether the finding of the first trial is logically inconsistent

with guilt in the second case.

(3) At a court-martial for larceny, the military judge excluded evidence

of a statement made by the accused relating to the larceny and other uncharged

offenses because the statement was obtained by coercion. At a second court-martial

for an unrelated offense, the statement excluded at the first trial would

be inadmissible, based on the earlier ruling, if the first case had become

final. If the earlier ruling had been based on an incorrect interpretation

of law, however, the issue of admissibility could be litigated anew at the

second proceeding.

(4) At a court-martial for absence without authority, the charge and

specification were dismissed for failure to state an offense. At a later

court-martial for the same offense, the earlier dismissal would be grounds

for dismissing the same charge and specification, but would not bar further

 proceedings on a new specification not containing the same defect as the

original specification.

### (h) Written motions.

Written motions may be submitted to the military judge after referral

and when appropriate they may be supported by affidavits, with service and

opportunity to reply to the opposing party. Such motions may be disposed

of before arraignment and without a session. Upon request, either party is

entitled to an Article 39(a) session to present oral argument or have an

evidentiary hearing concerning the disposition of written motions.

### (i) Service.

Written motions shall be served on all other parties. Unless otherwise

directed by the military judge, the service shall be made upon counsel for

each party.

### (j) Application to convening authority.

Except as otherwise provided in this Manual, any matters which may

be resolved upon motion without trial of the general issue of guilt may be

submitted by a party to the convening authority before trial for decision.

Submission of such matter to the convening authority is not, except as otherwise

provided in this Manual, required, and is, in any event, without prejudice

to the renewal of the issue by timely motion before the military judge.

### (k) Production of statements on motion to suppress.

Except as provided in this subsection, R.C.M. 914 shall apply at

a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence under subsection (b)(3) of this

rule. For purposes of this subsection, a law enforcement officer shall be

deemed a witness called by the Government, and upon a claim of privilege the

military judge shall excise portions of the statement containing privileged

matter.

## Rule 906. Motions for appropriate relief

### (a) In general.

A motion for appropriate relief is a request for a ruling to cure

a defect which deprives a party of a right or hinders a party from preparing

for trial or presenting its case.

### (b) Grounds for appropriate relief.

The following may be requested by motion for appropriate relief.

This list is not exclusive.

#### (1) Continuances.

A continuance may be granted only by the military judge.

##### Discussion

The military judge should, upon a showing of reasonable cause, grant

a continuance to any party for as long and as often as is just. Article 40.

Whether a request for a continuance should be granted is a matter within

the discretion of the military judge. Reasons for a continuance may include:

 insufficient opportunity to prepare for trial; unavailability of an essential

witness; the interest of Government in the order of trial of related cases;

and illness of an accused, counsel, military judge, or member. _See

also_ R.C.M. 602; 803.

#### (2) Record of denial of individual military counsel or of denial of request to retain detailed counsel when a request for individual military counsel granted.

If a request for military counsel was denied, which

denial was upheld on appeal (if available) or if a request to retain detailed

counsel was denied when the accused is represented by individual military

counsel, and if the accused so requests, the military judge shall ensure

that a record of the matter is included in the record of trial, and may make

findings. The trial counsel may request a continuance to inform the convening

authority of those findings. The military judge may not dismiss the charges

or otherwise effectively prevent further proceedings based on this issue.

However, the military judge may grant reasonable continuances until the requested

military counsel can be made available if the unavailability results from

temporary conditions or if the decision of unavailability is in the process

 of review in administrative channels.

(3) Correction of defects in the Article 32 preliminary hearing or pretrial

advice.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 405; 406. If the motion is granted,

the military judge should ordinarily grant a continuance so the defect may

be corrected.

#### (4) Amendment of charges or specifications.

A charge or specification may not be amended over the accused's objection unless the amendment is minor within the meaning of R.C.M. 603(a).

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 307.

  An amendment

may be appropriate when a specification is unclear, redundant, inartfully

drafted, misnames an accused, or is laid under the wrong article. A specification

may be amended by striking surplusage, or substituting or adding new language.

Surplusage may include irrelevant or redundant details or aggravating circumstances

which are not necessary to enhance the maximum authorized punishment or to

explain the essential facts of the offense. When a specification is amended

after the accused has entered a plea to it, the accused should be asked to

plead anew to the amended specification. A bill of particulars (_see

_ subsection (b)(6) of this rule) may also be used when a specification

is indefinite or ambiguous.

  If a specification, although

stating an offense, is so defective that the accused appears to have been

misled, the accused should be given a continuance upon request, or, in an

appropriate case (_see_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3)), the specification

may be dismissed.

(5) Severance of a duplicitous specification into two or more specifications.

##### Discussion

Each specification may state only one offense. R.C.M. 307(c)(4). A duplicitous specification is one which alleges two or more separate offenses. Lesser included offenses (_see_ paragraph 3, Part IV) are not separate, nor is a continuing offense involving separate acts. The sole remedy for a duplicitous specification is severance of the specification into two or more specifications, each of which alleges a separate offense contained in the duplicitous specification. However, if the duplicitousness is combined with or results in other defects, such as misleading the accused, other remedies may be appropriate.  See subsection (b)(3) of this rule. _See also_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3).

#### (6) Bill of particulars.

A bill of particulars may be amended at any time, subject to such

conditions as justice permits.

##### Discussion

The purposes of a bill of particulars are to inform the accused

of the nature of the charge with sufficient precision to enable the accused

to prepare for trial, to avoid or minimize the danger of surprise at the

time of trial, and to enable the accused to plead the acquittal or conviction

in bar of another prosecution for the same offense when the specification

itself is too vague and indefinite for such purposes.

  A

bill of particulars should not be used to conduct discovery of the Government's

theory of a case, to force detailed disclosure of acts underlying a charge,

or to restrict the Government's proof at trial.

  A bill

of particulars need not be sworn because it is not part of the specification.

A bill of particulars cannot be used to repair a specification which is otherwise

not legally sufficient.

(7) Discovery and production of evidence and witnesses.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 701 concerning discovery. _See

_ R.C.M. 703, 914 and 1001(e) concerning production of evidence and

witnesses.

#### (8) Relief from pretrial confinement.

 Upon a motion for release from pretrial confinement, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the motion and any hearing, the right to confer with trial counsel, and the right to be reasonably heard. Inability to reasonably afford a victim these rights shall not delay the proceedings. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 305(j).

(9) Severance of multiple accused, if it appears that an accused or

the Government is prejudiced by a joint or common trial. In a common trial,

a severance shall be granted whenever any accused, other than the moving

accused, faces charges unrelated to those charged against the moving accused.

##### Discussion

 A motion for severance is a request that one or more accused against whom charges have been referred to a joint or common trial be tried separately. Such a request should be granted if good cause is shown. For example, a severance may be appropriate when: the moving party wishes to use the testimony of one or more of the coaccused or the spouse of a coaccused; a defense of a coaccused is antagonistic to the moving party; or evidence as to any other accused will improperly prejudice the moving accused.

 If a severance is granted by the military judge, the military judge will decide which accused will be tried first. See R.C.M. 801(a)(1). In the case of joint charges, the military judge will direct an appropriate amendment of the charges and specifications.

 _See_ also R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3); 604; 812.

(10) Severance of offenses, but only to prevent manifest injustice.

##### Discussion

Ordinarily, all known charges should be tried at a single court-martial.

Joinder of minor and major offenses, or of unrelated offenses is not alone

a sufficient ground to sever offenses. For example, when an essential witness

as to one offense is unavailable, it might be appropriate to sever that offense

to prevent violation of the accused's right to a speedy trial.

#### (11) Change of place of trial.

The place of trial may be changed when necessary to prevent prejudice

to the rights of the accused or for the convenience of the Government if

the rights of the accused are not prejudiced thereby.

##### Discussion

A change of the place of trial may be necessary when there exists

in the place where the court-martial is pending so great a prejudice against

the accused that the accused cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there,

or to obtain compulsory process over an essential witness.

  When

it is necessary to change the place of trial, the choice of places to which

the court-martial will be transferred will be left to the convening authority,

as long as the choice is not inconsistent with the ruling of the military

judge.

#### (12) Unreasonable multiplication of charges.

The military judge may provide a remedy, as provided below, if he or she finds there has been an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentence.

##### (i) As applied to findings.

 Charges that arise from substantially the same transaction, while not legally multiplicious, may still be unreasonably multiplied as applied to findings. When the military judge finds, in his or her discretion, that the offenses have been unreasonably multiplied, the appropriate remedy shall be dismissal of the lesser offenses or merger of the offenses into one specification.

##### (ii) As applied to sentence.

 Where the military judge finds that the nature of the harm requires a remedy that focuses more appropriately on punishment than on findings, he or she may find that there is an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence. If the military judge makes such a finding, the maximum punishment for those offenses determined to be unreasonably multiplied shall be the maximum authorized punishment of the offense carrying the greatest maximum punishment.

#### Discussion

Unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence is a limitation on the military's discretion to charge separate offenses and does not have a foundation in the Constitution. The concept is based on reasonableness and the prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. In contrast, multiplicity is grounded in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. It prevents an accused from being twice punished for one offense if it is contrary to the intent of Congress. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3). Therefore, a motion for relief from unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence differs from a motion to dismiss on the grounds of multiplicity.

  The following non-exhaustive factors should be considered when determining whether two or more offenses are unreasonably multiplied: whether the specifications are aimed at distinctly separate criminal acts; whether they represent or exaggerate the accused's criminality; whether they unreasonably increase his or her exposure to punishment; and whether they suggest prosecutorial abuse of discretion in drafting of the specifications. Because prosecutors are permitted to plead in the alternative based on exigencies of proof, a ruling on this motion ordinarily should be deferred until after findings are entered.

(13) Preliminary ruling on admissibility of evidence.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 104(c)

  A request

for a preliminary ruling on admissibility is a request that certain matters

 which are ordinarily decided during trial of the general issue be resolved

 before they arise, outside the presence of members. The purpose of such

a motion is to avoid the prejudice which may result from bringing inadmissible

 matters to the attention of court members.

  Whether to rule

on an evidentiary question before it arises during trial is a matter within

the discretion of the military judge. _But see_ R.C.M. 905(b)(3)

and (d); and Mil. R. Evid. 304(e)(2); 311(e)(2); 321(d)(2). Reviewability

of preliminary rulings will be controlled by the Supreme Court's decision

in_ Luce v. United States_, 469 U.S. 38 (1984).

(14) Motions relating to mental capacity or responsibility of the accused.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 706, 909, and 916(k) regarding procedures

and standards concerning the mental capacity or responsibility of the accused.

## Rule 907. Motions to dismiss

### (a) In general.

A motion to dismiss is a request to terminate further proceedings

as to one or more charges and specifications on grounds capable of resolution

without trial of the general issue of guilt.

#### Discussion

Dismissal of a specification terminates the proceeding with respect

 to that specification unless the decision to dismiss is reconsidered and

reversed by the military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 905(f). Dismissal

of a specification on grounds stated in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3)(A) below

does not ordinarily bar a later court-martial for the same offense if the

grounds for dismissal no longer exist. _See also_ R.C.M. 905(g)

and subsection (b)(2) below.

  _See_ R.C.M.

916 concerning defenses.

### (b) Grounds for dismissal.

Grounds for dismissal include the following-

#### (1) Nonwaivable grounds.

A charge or specification shall be dismissed at any stage of the

 proceedings if:

(A) The court-martial lacks jurisdiction to try the accused for the

 offense; or

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 201-203.

(B) The specification fails to state an offense.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)

#### (2) Waivable grounds.

A charge or specification shall be dismissed upon motion made by

the accused before the final adjournment of the court-martial in that case

if:

(A) Dismissal is required under R.C.M. 707;

(B) The statute of limitations (Article 43) has run, provided that,

if it appears that the accused is unaware of the right to assert the statute

of limitations in bar of trial, the military judge shall inform the accused

of this right;

###### Discussion

Except for certain offenses for which there is

either:

no limitation as to time;

or child abuse offenses for which a time limitation has been enacted and applies that is based upon the life of a child abuse victim,

_ see_ Article 43(a)

and (b)(2)

, a person charged with an offense

under the code may not be tried by court-martial over objection if sworn

 charges have not been received by the officer exercising summary court-martial

 jurisdiction over the command within five years. _See_ Article

43(b). This period may be tolled (Article 43(c) and (d)), extended (Article

43(e) and (g)), or suspended (Article 43(f)) under certain circumstances.

The prosecution bears the burden of proving that the statute of limitations

has been tolled, extended, or suspended if it appears that is has run.

  Some

offenses are continuing offenses and any period of the offense occurring

within the statute of limitations is not barred. Absence without leave, desertion,

and fraudulent enlistment are not continuing offenses and are committed,

respectively, on the day the person goes absent, deserts, or first receives

pay or allowances under the enlistment.

  When computing the

statute of limitations, periods in which the accused was fleeing from justice

 or periods when the accused was absent without leave or in desertion are

 excluded. The military judge must determine by a preponderance, as an interlocutory

matter, whether the accused was absent without authority or fleeing from

justice. It would not be necessary that the accused be charged with the absence

offense. In cases where the accused is charged with both an absence offense

and a non-absence offense, but is found not guilty of the absence offense,

the military judge would reconsider, by a preponderance, his or her prior

determination whether that period of time is excludable.

  If

sworn charges have been received by an officer exercising summary court-martial

jurisdiction over the command within the period of the statute, minor amendments

(_see_ R.C.M. 603(a)) may be made in the specification after

the statute of limitations has run. However, if new charges are drafted or

a major amendment made (_see_ R.C.M. 603(d)) after the statute

of limitations has run, prosecution is barred. The date of receipt of sworn

charges is excluded when computing the appropriate statutory period. The

date of the offense is included in the computation of the elapsed time. Article

43(g) allows the government time to reinstate charges dismissed as defective

or insufficient for any cause. The government would have up to six months

to reinstate the charges if the original period of limitations has expired

or will expire within six months of the dismissal.

  In some

cases, the issue whether the statute of limitations has run will depend on

the findings on the general issue of guilt. For example, where the date of

an offense is in dispute, a finding by the court-martial that the offense

occurred at an earlier time may affect a determination as to the running

of the statute of limitations.

  When the statute of limitations

has run as to a lesser included offense, but not as to the charged offense, _

see_ R.C.M. 920(e)(2) with regard to instructions on the lesser offense.

(C) The accused has previously been tried by court-martial or federal

 civilian court for the same offense, provided that:

(i) No court-martial proceeding is a trial in the sense of this rule

 unless presentation of evidence on the general issue of guilt has begun;

(ii) No court-martial proceeding which has been terminated under R.C.M.

 604(b) or R.C.M. 915 shall bar later prosecution for the same offense or

offenses, if so provided in those rules;

(iii) No court-martial proceeding in which an accused has been found guilty

 of any charge or specification is a trial in the sense of this rule until

the finding of guilty has become final after review of the case has been

fully completed; and

(iv) No court-martial proceeding which lacked jurisdiction to try the

 accused for the offense is a trial in the sense of this rule.

(D) Prosecution is barred by:

(i) A pardon issued by the President;

####### Discussion

A pardon may grant individual or general amnesty.

(ii) Immunity from prosecution granted by a person authorized to do

so;

####### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 704.

(iii) Constructive condonation of desertion established by unconditional

 restoration to duty without trial of a deserter by a general court-martial

convening authority who knew of the desertion; or

(iv) Prior punishment under Articles 13 or 15 for the same offense, if

 that offense was minor.

####### Discussion

 _See_ Articles 13 and 15(f). _See_ paragraph

1e of Part V for a definition of "minor" offenses.

#### (3) Permissible grounds.

A specification may be dismissed upon timely motion by the accused if one of the following is applicable:

##### (A) Defective.

When the specification is so defective that it substantially misled the accused, and the military judge finds that, in the interest of justice, trial should proceed on any remaining charges and specifications without undue delay; or

##### (B) Multiplicity.

When the specification is multiplicious with another specification, is unnecessary to enable the prosecution to meet the exigencies of proof through trial, review, and appellate action, and should be dismissed in the interest of justice. A charge is multiplicious if the proof of such charge also proves every element of another charge.

###### Discussion

  Multiplicity is a legal concept, arising from the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense. Absent legislative intent to the contrary, an accused cannot be convicted and punished for violations of two or more statutes if those violations arise from a single act. Where Congress intended to impose multiple punishments for the same act, imposition of such sentence does not violate the Constitution.

  Multiplicity differs from unreasonable multiplication of charges. If two offenses are not multiplicious, they nonetheless may constitute an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentence. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Unreasonable multiplication of charges is a limitation on the military's discretion to charge separate offenses. It does not have a foundation in the Constitution; it is based on reasonableness and the prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. The military judge is to determine, in his or her discretion, whether the charges constitute unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentencing. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12).

  To determine if two charges are multiplicious, the practitioner should first determine whether they are based on separate acts. If so, the charges are not multiplicious because separate acts may be charged and punished separately. If the charges are based upon a single act, the practitioner should next determine if Congress intended to impose multiple convictions and punishments for the same act. When there is no overt expression of congressional intent in the relevant statutes, such intent may be inferred based on the elements of the charged statutes and their relationship to each other or other principles of statutory interpretation. If each statute contains an element not contained in the other, it may be inferred that Congress intended they be charged and punished separately. Likewise, if each statute contains the same elements, it may be inferred that Congress did not intend they be charged and punished separately. A lesser included offense will always be multiplicious if charged separately, but offenses do not have to be lesser included to be multiplicious.

  Ordinarily, a specification should not be dismissed for multiplicity before trial. The less serious of any multiplicious specifications shall be dismissed after findings have been reached. Due consideration must be given, however, to possible post-trial or appellate action with regard to the remaining specification.

## Rule 908. Appeal by the United States

### (a) In general.

In a trial by a court-martial over which a military judge presides

 and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States may

appeal an order or ruling that terminates the proceedings with respect to

a charge or specification, or excludes evidence that is substantial proof

 of a fact material in the proceedings, or directs the disclosure of classified

information, or that imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information.

 The United States may also appeal a refusal by the military judge to issue

a protective order sought by the United States to prevent the disclosure

of classified information or to enforce such an order that has previously

been issued by the appropriate authority. However, the United States may

not appeal an order or ruling that is, or amounts to, a finding of not guilty

with respect to the charge or specification.

### (b) Procedure.

#### (1) Delay.

After an order or ruling which may be subject to an appeal by the

 United States, the court-martial may not proceed, except as to matters unaffected

by the ruling or order, if the trial counsel requests a delay to determine

whether to file notice of appeal under this rule. Trial counsel is entitled

to no more than 72 hours under this subsection.

#### (2) Decision to appeal.

The decision whether to file notice of appeal under this rule shall

 be made within 72 hours of the ruling or order to be appealed. If the Secretary

concerned so prescribes, the trial counsel shall not file notice of appeal

unless authorized to do so by a person designated by the Secretary concerned.

#### (3) Notice of appeal.

If the United States elects to appeal, the trial counsel shall

provide the military judge with written notice to this effect not later than

72 hours after the ruling or order. Such notice shall identify the ruling

or order to be appealed and the charges and specifications affected. Trial

counsel shall certify that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay

and (if the order or ruling appealed is one which excludes evidence) that

the evidence excluded is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.

#### (4) Effect on the court-martial.

Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)

of this rule, the ruling or order that is the subject of the appeal is automatically

stayed and no session of the court-martial may proceed pending disposition

by the Court of Criminal Appeals of the appeal, except that solely as to

charges and specifications not affected by the ruling or order:

(A) Motions may be litigated, in the discretion of the military judge,

at any point in the proceedings;

(B) When trial on the merits has not begun,

(i) a severance may be granted upon request of all the parties;

(ii) a severance may be granted upon request of the accused and when

 appropriate under R.C.M. 906(b)(10); or

(C) When trial on the merits has begun but has not been completed, a

 party may, on that party's request and in the discretion of the military

judge, present further evidence on the merits.

#### (5) Record.

Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)

of this rule, trial counsel shall cause a record of the proceedings to be

prepared. Such record shall be verbatim and complete to the extent necessary

to resolve the issues appealed. R.C.M. 1103(g), (h), and (i) shall apply

and the record shall be authenticated in accordance with R.C.M. 1104(a).

The military judge or the Court of Criminal Appeals may direct that additional

parts of the proceeding be included in the record; R.C.M. 1104(d) shall not

apply to such additions.

#### (6) Forwarding.

Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)

of this rule, trial counsel shall promptly and by expeditious means forward

the appeal to a representative of the Government designated by the Judge

Advocate General. The matter forwarded shall include: a statement of the

issues appealed; the record of the proceedings or, if preparation of the

record has not been completed, a summary of the evidence; and such other

matters as the Secretary concerned may prescribe. The person designated by

the Judge Advocate General shall promptly decide whether to file the appeal

with the Court of Criminal Appeals and notify the trial counsel of that

decision.

#### (7) Appeal filed.

If the United States elects to file an appeal, it shall be filed

 directly with the Court of Criminal Appeals, in accordance with the rules

of that court.

#### (8) Appeal not filed.

If the United States elects not to file an appeal, trial counsel

 promptly shall notify the military judge and the other parties.

#### (9) Pretrial confinement of accused pending appeal.

If an accused is in pretrial confinement at the time the United

 States files notice of its intent to appeal under subsection (3) above,

the commander, in determining whether the accused should be confined pending

 the outcome of an appeal by the United States, should consider the same

factors which would authorize the imposition of pretrial confinement under

R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B).

### (c) Appellate proceedings.

#### (1) Appellate counsel.

The parties shall be represented before appellate courts in proceedings

under this rule as provided in R.C.M. 1202. Appellate Government counsel

shall diligently prosecute an appeal under this rule.

#### (2) Court of Criminal Appeals.

An appeal under Article 62 shall, whenever practicable, have priority

 over all other proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeals. In determining

an appeal under Article 62, the Court of Criminal Appeals may take action

only with respect to matters of law.

#### (3) Action following decision of Court of Criminal Appeals.

After the Court of Criminal Appeals has decided any appeal under

 Article 62, the accused may petition for review by the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces, or the Judge Advocate General may certify a question

 to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The parties shall be notified

of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals promptly. If the decision

is adverse to the accused, the accused shall be notified of the decision

 and of the right to petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for

 review within 60 days orally on the record at the court-martial or in accordance

with R.C.M. 1203(d). If the accused is notified orally on the record, trial

counsel shall forward by expeditious means a certificate that the accused

was so notified to the Judge Advocate General, who shall forward a copy to

the clerk of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces when required by

the Court. If the decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals permits it, the

court-martial may proceed as to the affected charges and specifications pending

further review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces or the Supreme

Court, unless either court orders the proceedings stayed. Unless the case

 is reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, it shall be returned

 to the military judge or the convening authority for appropriate action

in accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals. If the

 case is reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, R.C.M. 1204

and 1205 shall apply.

### (d) Military judge.

For purposes of this rule, "military judge" does not

 include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.

## Rule 909. Capacity of the accused to stand trial by court-martial

### (a) In general.

No person may be brought to trial by court-martial if that person

is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him or

her mentally incompetent to the extent that he or she is unable to understand

 the nature of the proceedings against them or to conduct or cooperate intelligently

in the defense of the case.

#### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 916(k).

### (b) Presumption of capacity.

A person is presumed to have the capacity to stand trial unless

the contrary is established.

### (c) Determination before referral.

If an inquiry pursuant to R.C.M. 706 conducted before referral

concludes that an accused is suffering from a mental disease or defect that

renders him or her mentally incompetent to stand trial, the convening authority

before whom the charges are pending for disposition may disagree with the

conclusion and take any action authorized under R.C.M. 401, including referral

of the charges to trial. If that convening authority concurs with the conclusion,

he or she shall forward the charges to the general court-martial convening

 authority. If, upon receipt of the charges, the general court-martial convening

authority similarly concurs, then he or she shall commit the accused to the

custody of the Attorney General. If the general court-martial convening

authority does not concur, that authority may take any action that he or

she deems appropriate in accordance with R.C.M. 407, including referral of

the charges to trial.

### (d) Determination after referral.

After referral, the military judge may conduct a hearing to determine

 the mental capacity of the accused, either _sua sponte_ or

upon request of either party. If an inquiry pursuant to R.C.M. 706 conducted

 before or after referral concludes that an accused is suffering from a mental

 disease or defect that renders him or her mentally incompetent to stand

trial, the military judge shall conduct a hearing to determine the mental

capacity of the accused. Any such hearing shall be conducted in accordance

with paragraph (e) of this rule.

### (e) Incompetence determination hearing.

#### (1) Nature of issue.

The mental capacity of the accused is an interlocutory question

of fact.

#### (2) Standard.

Trial may proceed unless it is established by a preponderance of

the evidence that the accused is presently suffering from a mental disease

or defect rendering him or her mentally incompetent to the extent that he

or she is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings or to conduct

or cooperate intelligently in the defense of the case. In making this determination,

the military judge is not bound by the rules of evidence except with respect

to privileges.

(3) If the military judge finds the accused is incompetent to stand

 trial, the judge shall report this finding to the general court-martial

convening authority, who shall commit the accused to the custody of the

Attorney General

### (f) Hospitalization of the accused.

An accused who is found incompetent to stand trial under this rule

 shall be hospitalized by the Attorney General as provided in section 4241(d)

of title 18, United States Code. If notified that the accused has recovered

to such an extent that he or she is able to understand the nature of the

proceedings and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of the

case, then the general court-martial convening authority shall promptly

take custody of the accused. If, at the end of the period of hospitalization,

the accused's mental condition has not so improved, action shall be taken

in accordance with section 4246 of title 18, United States Code.

#### Discussion

Under section 4241(d) of title 18, the initial period of hospitalization

for an incompetent accused shall not exceed four months. However, in determining

whether there is a substantial probability the accused will attain the capacity

to permit the trial to proceed in the foreseeable future, the accused may

be hospitalized for an additional reasonable period of time. This additional

period of time ends either when the accused's mental condition is improved

so that trial may proceed, or when the pending charges against the accused

are dismissed. If charges are dismissed solely due to the accused's mental

condition, the accused is subject to hospitalization as provided in section

4246 of title 18.

### (g) Excludable delay.

All periods of commitment shall be excluded as provided by R.C.M.

 707(c). The 120-day time period under R.C.M. 707 shall begin anew on the

date the general court-martial convening authority takes custody of the

accused at the end of any period of commitment.

## Rule 910. Pleas

### (a) Alternatives.

#### (1) In general.

An accused may plead as follows: guilty; not guilty to an offense

as charged, but guilty of a named lesser included offense; guilty with exceptions,

with or without substitutions, not guilty of the exceptions, but guilty

of the substitutions, if any; or, not guilty. A plea of guilty may not be

received as to an offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged by

the court-martial.

##### Discussion

 _See_ paragraph 3, Part IV, concerning lesser included offenses. When the plea is to a lesser included offense without the use of exceptions and substitutions, the defense counsel should provide a written revised specification to be included in the record as an appellate exhibit.

  A plea of guilty to a lesser included offense does not bar the prosecution from proceeding on the offense as charged. _See also_ subsection (g) of this rule.

  A plea of guilty does not prevent the introduction of evidence, either in support of the factual basis for the plea, or, after findings are entered, in aggravation. _See_ R.C.M. 1001(b)(4).

#### (2) Conditional pleas.

With the approval of the military judge and the consent of the

Government, an accused may enter a conditional plea of guilty, reserving

the right, on further review or appeal, to review of the adverse determination

of any specified pretrial motion. If the accused prevails on further review

or appeal, the accused shall be allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty. The

Secretary concerned may prescribe who may consent for Government; unless

otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the trial counsel may consent

 on behalf of the Government.

### (b) Refusal to plead; irregular plea.

If an accused fails or refuses to plead, or makes an irregular plea,

 the military judge shall enter a plea of not guilty for the accused.

#### Discussion

An irregular plea includes pleas such as guilty without criminality

 or guilty to a charge but not guilty to all specifications thereunder. When

a plea is ambiguous, the military judge should have it clarified before

proceeding further.

### (c) Advice to accused.

Before accepting a plea of guilty, the military judge shall address

 the accused personally and inform the accused of, and determine that the

accused understands, the following:

(1) The nature of the offense to which the plea is offered, the mandatory

 minimum penalty, if any, provided by law, and the maximum possible penalty

provided by law;

##### Discussion

The elements of each offense to which the accused has pleaded guilty

 should be described to the accused. _See also_ subsection

(e) of this rule.

(2) In a general or special court-martial, if the accused is not represented

by counsel, that the accused has the right to be represented by counsel at

every stage of the proceedings;

##### Discussion

In a general or special court-martial, if the accused is not represented

by counsel, a plea of guilty should not be accepted.

(3) That the accused has the right to plead not guilty or to persist

in that plea if already made, and that the accused has the right to be tried

by a court-martial, and that at such trial the accused has the right to

confront and cross-examine witnesses against the accused, and the right against

self-incrimination;

(4) That if the accused pleads guilty, there will not be a trial of

any kind as to those offenses to which the accused has so pleaded, so that

by pleading guilty the accused waives the rights described in subsection

(c)(3) of this Rule; and

(5) That if the accused pleads guilty, the military judge will question

 the accused about the offenses to which the accused has pleaded guilty,

and, if the accused answers these questions under oath, on the record, and

in the presence of counsel, the accused's answers may later be used against

the accused in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.

##### Discussion

The advice in subsection (5) is inapplicable in a court-martial

in which the accused is not represented by counsel.

### (d) Ensuring that the plea is voluntary.

The military judge shall not accept a plea of guilty without first,

 by addressing the accused personally, determining that the plea is voluntary

and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea

agreement under R.C.M. 705. The military judge shall also inquire whether

the accused's willingness to plead guilty results from prior discussions

between the convening authority, a representative of the convening authority,

or trial counsel, and the accused or defense counsel.

### (e) Determining accuracy of plea.

The military judge shall not accept a plea of guilty without making

 such inquiry of the accused as shall satisfy the military judge that there

is a factual basis for the plea. The accused shall be questioned under oath

about the offenses.

#### Discussion

A plea of guilty must be in accord with the truth. Before the plea

is accepted, the accused must admit every element of the offense(s) to which

the accused pleaded guilty. Ordinarily, the elements should be explained

to the accused. If any potential defense is raised by the accused's account

of the offense or by other matter presented to the military judge, the military

judge should explain such a defense to the accused and should not accept

the plea unless the accused admits facts which negate the defense. If the

 statute of limitations would otherwise bar trial for the offense, the military

 judge should not accept a plea of guilty to it without an affirmative waiver

by the accused. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B).

  The

accused need not describe from personal recollection all the circumstances

necessary to establish a factual basis for the plea. Nevertheless the accused

must be convinced of, and able to describe all the facts necessary to establish

guilt. For example, an accused may be unable to recall certain events in

 an offense, but may still be able to adequately describe the offense based

on witness statements or similar sources which the accused believes to be

true.

  The accused should remain at the counsel table during

 questioning by the military judge.

### (f) Plea agreement inquiry.

#### (1) In general.

A plea agreement may not be accepted if it does not comply with

 R.C.M. 705.

#### (2) Notice.

The parties shall inform the military judge if a plea agreement

 exists.

##### Discussion

The military judge should ask whether a plea agreement exists. _

See_ subsection (d) of this rule. Even if the military judge fails

to so inquire or the accused answers incorrectly, counsel have an obligation

to bring any agreements or understandings in connection with the plea to

the attention of the military judge.

#### (3) Disclosure.

If a plea agreement exists, the military judge shall require disclosure

of the entire agreement before the plea is accepted, provided that in trial

before military judge alone the military judge ordinarily shall not examine

any sentence limitation contained in the agreement until after the sentence

of the court-martial has been announced.

#### (4) Inquiry.

The military judge shall inquire to ensure:

(A) That the accused understands the agreement; and

(B) That the parties agree to the terms of the agreement.

###### Discussion

If the plea agreement contains any unclear or ambiguous terms, the

 military judge should obtain clarification from the parties. If there is

doubt about the accused's understanding of any terms in the agreement, the

military judge should explain those terms to the accused.

### (g) Findings.

Findings based on a plea of guilty may be entered immediately upon

 acceptance of the plea at an Article 39(a) session unless:

(1) Such action is not permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned;

(2) The plea is to a lesser included offense and the prosecution intends

 to proceed to trial on the offense as charged; or

(3) Trial is by a special court-martial without a military judge, in

 which case the president of the court-martial may enter findings based on

the pleas without a formal vote except when subsection (g)(2) of this rule

applies.

##### Discussion

If the accused has pleaded guilty to some offenses but not to others,

 the military judge should ordinarily defer informing the members of the

offenses to which the accused has pleaded guilty until after findings on

the remaining offenses have been entered. _ See_ R.C.M. 913(a),

Discussion and R.C.M. 920(e), Discussion, paragraph 3.

### (h) Later action.

#### (1) Withdrawal by the accused.

If after acceptance of the plea but before the sentence is announced

 the accused requests to withdraw a plea of guilty and substitute a plea

of not guilty or a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense, the military

judge may as a matter of discretion permit the accused to do so.

#### (2) Statements by accused inconsistent with plea.

If after findings but before the sentence is announced the accused

 makes a statement to the court-martial, in testimony or otherwise, or presents

evidence which is inconsistent with a plea of guilty on which a finding

is based, the military judge shall inquire into the providence of the plea.

 If, following such inquiry, it appears that the accused entered the plea

improvidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect

a plea of not guilty shall be entered as to the affected charges and specifications.

##### Discussion

When the accused withdraws a previously accepted plea for guilty

or a plea of guilty is set aside, counsel should be given a reasonable time

to prepare to proceed. In a trial by military judge alone, recusal of the

military judge or disapproval of the request for trial by military judge

alone will ordinarily be necessary when a plea is rejected or withdrawn after

findings; in trial with members, a mistrial will ordinarily be necessary.

#### (3) Pretrial agreement inquiry.

After sentence is announced the military judge shall inquire into

any parts of a pretrial agreement which were not previously examined by

the military judge. If the military judge determines that the accused does

not understand the material terms of the agreement, or that the parties disagree

as to such terms, the military judge shall conform, with the consent of the

Government, the agreement to the accused's understanding or permit the accused

to withdraw the plea.

##### Discussion

 _See_ subsection (f)(3) of this rule.

### (i) Record of proceedings.

A verbatim record of the guilty plea proceedings shall be made in

 cases in which a verbatim record is required under R.C.M. 1103. In other

special courts-martial, a summary of the explanation and replies shall be

included in the record of trial. As to summary courts-martial, _see

_ R.C.M. 1305.

### (j) Waiver.

Except as provided in subsection (a)(2) of this rule, a plea of

 guilty which results in a finding of guilty waives any objection, whether

or not previously raised, insofar as the objection relates to the factual

 issue of guilt of the offense(s) to which the plea was made.

## Rule 911. Assembly of the court-martial

The military judge shall announce the assembly of the court-martial.

### Discussion

When trial is by a court-martial with members, the court-martial

is ordinarily assembled immediately after the members are sworn. The members

are ordinarily sworn at the first session at which they appear, as soon

as all parties and personnel have been announced. The members are seated

with the president, who is the senior member, in the center, and the other

members alternately to the president's right and left according to rank.

If the rank of a member is changed, or if the membership of the court-martial

changes, the members should be reseated accordingly.

  When

trial is by military judge alone, the court-martial is ordinarily assembled

immediately following approval of the request for trial by military judge

alone.

  Assembly of the court-martial is significant because

it marks the point after which: substitution of the members and military

judge may no longer take place without good cause (_see_ Article

29; R.C.M. 505; 902; 912); the accused may no longer, as a matter of right,

 request trial by military judge alone or withdraw such a request previously

approved (_see_ Article 16; R.C.M. 903(a)(2)(d)); and the

 accused may no longer request, even with the permission of the military judge,

 or withdraw from a request for, enlisted members (_see_ Article

25(c)(1); R.C.M. 903(a)(1)(d)).

## Rule 912. Challenge of selection of members; examination and challenges of members

### (a) Pretrial matters.

#### (1) Questionnaires.

Before trial the trial counsel may, and shall upon request of the

 defense counsel, submit to each member written questions requesting the

following information:

(A) Date of birth;

(B) Sex;

(C) Race;

(D) Marital status and sex, age, and number of dependents;

(E) Home of record;

(F) Civilian and military education, including, when available, major

 areas of study, name of school or institution, years of education, and degrees

received;

(G) Current unit to which assigned;

(H) Past duty assignments;

(I) Awards and decorations received;

(J) Date of rank; and

(K) Whether the member has acted as accuser, counsel, preliminary hearing officer, convening authority, or legal officer or staff judge advocate for

the convening authority in the case, or has forwarded the charges with a

 recommendation as to disposition.

 Additional information may

be requested with the approval of the military judge. Each member's responses

to the questions shall be written and signed by the member.

###### Discussion

Using questionnaires before trial may expedite voir dire and may

 permit more informed exercise of challenges.

  If the questionnaire

is marked or admitted as an exhibit at the court-martial it must be attached

to or included in the record of trial. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(D)(iv)

and (b)(3)(B).

#### (2) Other materials.

A copy of any written materials considered by the convening authority

 in selecting the members detailed to the court-martial shall be provided

to any party upon request, except that such materials pertaining solely

to persons who were not selected for detail as members need not be provided

unless the military judge, for good cause, so directs.

### (b) Challenge of selection of members.

#### (1) Motion.

Before the examination of members under subsection (d) of this rule

 begins, or at the next session after a party discovered or could have discovered

by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier,

that party may move to stay the proceedings on the ground that members were

selected improperly.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 502(a) and 503(a) concerning selection

of members. Members are also improperly selected when, for example, a certain

group or class is arbitrarily excluded from consideration as members.

#### (2) Procedure.

Upon a motion under subsection (b)(1) of this rule containing an

 offer of proof of matters which, if true, would constitute improper selection

of members, the moving party shall be entitled to present evidence, including

any written materials considered by the convening authority in selecting

the members. Any other party may also present evidence on the matter. If

the military judge determines that the members have been selected improperly,

the military judge shall stay any proceedings requiring the presence of members

until members are properly selected.

#### (3) Waiver.

Failure to make a timely motion under this subsection shall waive

the improper selection unless it constitutes a violation of R.C.M. 501(a),

502(a)(1), or 503(a)(2).

### (c) Stating grounds for challenge.

The trial counsel shall state any ground for challenge for cause

 against any member of which the trial counsel is aware.

### (d) Examination of members.

The military judge may permit the parties to conduct the examination

 of members or may personally conduct the examination. In the latter event

the military judge shall permit the parties to supplement the examination

 by such further inquiry as the military judge deems proper or the military

 judge shall submit to the members such additional questions by the parties

as the military judge deems proper. A member may be questioned outside the

presence of other members when the military judge so directs.

#### Discussion

Examination of the members is called "voir dire." If

the members have not already been placed under oath for the purpose of voir

dire (_see_ R.C.M. 807(b)(2) Discussion (B)), they should

 be sworn before they are questioned.

  The opportunity for

voir dire should be used to obtain information for the intelligent exercise

 of challenges; counsel should not purposely use voir dire to present factual

 matter which will not be admissible or to argue the case.

  The

nature and scope of the examination of members is within the discretion of

the military judge. Members may be questioned individually or collectively.

Ordinarily, the military judge should permit counsel to personally question

the members. Trial counsel ordinarily conducts an inquiry before the defense.

Whether trial counsel will question all the members before the defense begins

or whether some other procedure will be followed depends on the circumstances.

For example, when members are questioned individually outside the presence

of other members, each party would ordinarily complete questioning that member

 before another member is questioned. The military judge and each party may

conduct additional questioning, after initial questioning by a party, as

necessary.

  Ordinarily the members should be asked whether

they are aware of any ground for challenge against them. This may expedite

further questioning. The members should be cautioned, however, not to disclose

 information in the presence of other members which might disqualify them.

### (e) Evidence.

Any party may present evidence relating to whether grounds for

challenge exist against a member.

### (f) Challenges and removal for cause.

#### (1) Grounds.

A member shall be excused for cause whenever it appears that the

 member:

(A) Is not competent to serve as a member under Article 25(a), (b),

or (c);

(B) Has not been properly detailed as a member of the court-martial;

(C) Is an accuser as to any offense charged;

(D) Will be a witness in the court-martial;

(E) Has acted as counsel for any party as to any offense charged;

(F) Has been an a preliminary hearing officer as to any offense charged;

(G) Has acted in the same case as convening authority or as the legal

 officer or staff judge advocate to the convening authority;

(H) Will act in the same case as reviewing authority or as the legal

 officer or staff judge advocate to the reviewing authority;

(I) Has forwarded charges in the case with a personal recommendation

as to disposition;

(J) Upon a rehearing or new or other trial of the case, was a member

of the court-martial which heard the case before;

(K) Is junior to the accused in grade or rank, unless it is established

 that this could not be avoided;

(L) Is in arrest or confinement;

(M) Has formed or expressed a definite opinion as to the guilt or

 innocence of the accused as to any offense charged;

(N) Should not sit as a member in the interest of having the court-martial

free from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality.

####### Discussion

Examples of matters which may be grounds for challenge under subsection

(N) are that the member: has a direct personal interest in the result of

the trial; is closely related to the accused, a counsel, or a witness in

the case; has participated as a member or counsel in the trial of a closely

related case; has a decidedly friendly or hostile attitude toward a party;

or has an inelastic opinion concerning an appropriate sentence for the offenses

charged.

#### (2) When made.

##### (A) Upon completion of examination.

Upon completion of any examination under subsection (d) of this

rule and the presentation of evidence, if any, on the matter, each party

shall state any challenges for cause it elects to make.

##### (B) Other times.

A challenge for cause may be made at any other time during trial

when it becomes apparent that a ground for challenge may exist. Such examination

of the member and presentation of evidence as may be necessary may be made

in order to resolve the matter.

#### (3) Procedure.

Each party shall be permitted to make challenges outside the presence

 of the members. The party making a challenge shall state the grounds for

it. Ordinarily the trial counsel shall enter any challenges for cause before

the defense counsel. The military judge shall rule finally on each challenge.

When a challenge for cause is granted, the member concerned shall be excused.

The burden of establishing that grounds for a challenge exist is upon the

party making the challenge. A member successfully challenged shall be excused.

#### (4) Waiver.

The grounds for challenge in subsection (f)(1)(A) of this rule may

 not be waived except that membership of enlisted members in the same unit

as the accused may be waived. Membership of enlisted members in the same

unit as the accused and any other ground for challenge is waived if the party

knew of or could have discovered by the exercise of diligence the ground

for challenge and failed to raise it in a timely manner. Notwithstanding

 the absence of a challenge or waiver of a challenge by the parties, the

military judge may, in the interest of justice, excuse a member against whom

a challenge for cause would lie. When a challenge for cause has been denied the successful use of a peremptory challenge by either party, excusing the challenged member from further participation in the court-martial, shall preclude further consideration of the challenge of that excused member upon later review. Further, failure by the challenging party to exercise a peremptory challenge against

any member shall constitute waiver of further consideration of the challenge

upon later review.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 606(b) when a member may

be a witness.

### (g) Peremptory challenges.

#### (1) Procedure.

Each party may challenge one member peremptorily. Any member so

 challenged shall be excused. No party may be required to exercise a peremptory

challenge before the examination of members and determination of any challenges

for cause has been completed. Ordinarily the trial counsel shall enter any

peremptory challenge before the defense.

##### Discussion

Generally, no reason is necessary for a peremptory challenge. _

 But see Batson v. Kentucky_ 476 U.S. 79 (1986); _United States

v. Curtis_, 33 M.J. 101 (C.M.A. 1991), _cert. denied_,

 112 S.Ct. 1177 (1992); _United States v. Moore_, 28 M.J. 366

 (C.M.A. 1989); _United States v. Santiago-Davilla_, 26 M.J.

380 (C.M.A. 1988).

#### (2) Waiver.

Failure to exercise a peremptory challenge when properly called

upon to do so shall waive the right to make such a challenge. The military

judge may, for good cause shown, grant relief from the waiver, but a peremptory

challenge may not be made after the presentation of evidence before the members

has begun. However, nothing in this subsection shall bar the exercise of

a previously unexercised peremptory challenge against a member newly detailed

under R.C.M. 505(c)(2)(B), even if presentation of evidence on the merits

has begun.

##### Discussion

When the membership of the court-martial has been reduced below

a quorum (_see_ R.C.M. 501) or, when enlisted members have

been requested, the fraction of enlisted members has been reduced below

one-third, the proceedings should be adjourned and the convening authority

notified so that new members may be detailed. _See_ R.C.M.

505. _See also_ R.C.M. 805(d) concerning other procedures

when new members are detailed.

### (h) Special courts-martial without a military judge.

In a special court-martial without a military judge, the procedures

 in this rule shall apply, except that challenges shall be made in the presence

of the members and a ruling on any challenge for cause shall be decided

by a majority vote of the members upon secret written ballot in closed session.

The challenged member shall not be present at the closed session at which

the challenge is decided. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member

challenged. Before closing, the president shall give such instructions as

may be necessary to resolve the challenge. Each challenge shall be decided

 separately, and all unexcused members except the challenged member shall

participate. When only three members are present and one is challenged,

the remaining two may decide the challenge. When the president is challenged,

 the next senior member shall act as president for purposes of deciding the

challenge.

### (i) Definitions.

#### (1) Military judge.

For purpose of this rule, "military judge" does not

 include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.

#### (2) Witness.

For purposes of this rule, "witness" includes one who

 testifies at a court-martial and anyone whose declaration is received in

evidence for any purpose, including written declarations made by affidavit

or otherwise.

##### Discussion

For example, a person who by certificate has attested or otherwise

 authenticated an official record or other writing introduced in evidence

is a witness.

#### (3) Preliminary hearing officer.

For purposes of this rule, "preliminary hearing officer" includes any person who has examined charges under R.C.M. 405 and any person who was counsel for a member of a court of inquiry, or otherwise personally has conducted an investigation of the general matter involving the offenses charged.

## Rule 913. Presentation of the case on the merits

### (a) Preliminary instructions.

The military judge may give such preliminary instructions as may

be appropriate. If mixed pleas have been entered, the military judge should

ordinarily defer informing the members of the offenses to which the accused

pleaded guilty until after the findings on the remaining contested offenses

have been entered.

#### Discussion

Preliminary instructions may include a description of the duties

of members, procedures to be followed in the court-martial, and other appropriate

matters.

  Exceptions to the rule requiring the military judge

to defer informing the members of an accused's prior pleas of guilty include

cases in which the accused has specifically requested, on the record, that

the military judge instruct the members of the prior pleas of guilty and

cases in which a plea of guilty was to a lesser included offense within the

contested offense charged in the specification. _See_ R.C.M.

910(g), Discussion and R.C.M. 920(e), Discussion, paragraph 3.

### (b) Opening statements.

Each party may make one opening statement to the court-martial before

 presentation of evidence has begun. The defense may elect to make its statement

after the prosecution has rested, before the presentation of evidence for

the defense. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit the

parties to address the court-martial at other times.

#### Discussion

Counsel should confine their remarks to evidence they expect to

be offered which they believe in good faith will be available and admissible

and a brief statement of the issues in the case.

### (c) Presentation of evidence.

Each party shall have full opportunity to present evidence.

#### (1) Order of presentation.

 Ordinarily the following sequence shall be followed:

(A) Presentation of evidence for the prosecution;

(B) Presentation of evidence for the defense;

(C) Presentation of prosecution evidence in rebuttal;

(D) Presentation of defense evidence in surrebuttal;

(E) Additional rebuttal evidence in the discretion of the military judge;

 and

(F) Presentation of evidence requested by the military judge or members.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 801(a) and Mil. R. Evid. 611 concerning

control by the military judge over the order of proceedings.

#### (2) Taking testimony.

The testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally in open session,

 unless otherwise provided in this Manual.

##### Discussion

Each witness must testify under oath. _See_ R.C.M.

 807(b)(1)(B); Mil. R. Evid. 603. After a witness is sworn, the witness should

be identified for the record (full name, rank, and unit, if military, or

full name and address, if civilian). The party calling the witness conducts

direct examination of the witness, followed by cross-examination of the witness

by the opposing party. Redirect and re-cross-examination are conducted as

necessary, followed by any questioning by the military judge and members.

 _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 611; 614.

  All documentary

and real evidence (except marks or wounds on a person's body) should be

marked for identification when first referred to in the proceedings and should

be included in the record of trial whether admitted in evidence or not. _

See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(C), (c). "Real evidence" include

physical objects, such as clothing, weapons, and marks or wounds on a person's

body. If it is impracticable to attach an item of real evidence to the record,

the item should be clearly and accurately described by testimony, photographs,

or other means so that it may be considered on review. Similarly, when documentary

evidence is used, if the document cannot be attached to the record (as in

 the case of an original official record or a large map), a legible copy or

 accurate extract should be included in the record. When a witness points

to or otherwise refers to certain parts of a map, photograph, diagram, chart,

 or other exhibit, the place to which the witness pointed or referred should

be clearly identified for the record, either by marking the exhibit or by

an accurate description of the witness' actions with regard to the exhibit.

#### (3) Views and inspections.

The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit the court-martial

to view or inspect premises or a place or an article or object. Such a view

or inspection shall take place only in the presence of all parties, the

members (if any), and the military judge. A person familiar with the scene

may be designated by the military judge to escort the court-martial. Such

person shall perform the duties of escort under oath. The escort shall not

testify, but may point out particular features prescribed by the military

judge. Any statement made at the view or inspection by the escort, a party,

the military judge, or any member shall be made part of the record.

##### Discussion

A view or inspection should be permitted only in extraordinary

circumstances. The fact that a view or inspection has been made does not

necessarily preclude the introduction in evidence of photographs, diagrams,

 maps, or sketches of the place or item viewed, if these are otherwise admissible.

#### (4) Evidence subject to exclusion.

When offered evidence would be subject to exclusion upon objection,

 the military judge may, as a matter of discretion, bring the matter to the

attention of the parties and may, in the interest of justice, exclude the

evidence without an objection by a party.

##### Discussion

The military judge should not exclude evidence which is not objected

 to by a party except in extraordinary circumstances. Counsel should be permitted

to try the case and present the evidence without unnecessary interference

 by the military judge. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 103.

#### (5) Reopening case.

The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit a party

to reopen its case after it has rested.

## Rule 914. Production of statements of witnesses

### (a) Motion for production.

After a witness other than the accused has testified on direct

examination, the military judge, on motion of a party who did not call the

witness, shall order the party who called the witness to produce, for examination

and use by the moving party, any statement of the witness that relates to

the subject matter concerning which the witness has testified, and that is:

(1) In the case of a witness called by the trial counsel, in the possession

of the United States; or

(2) In the case of a witness called by the defense, in the possession

of the accused or defense counsel.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 701 (Discovery).

  Counsel

should anticipate legitimate demands for statements under this and similar

rules and avoid delays in the proceedings by voluntary disclosure before

 arraignment.

  This rule does not apply to investigations

under Article 32.

  As to procedures for certain government

information as to which a privilege is asserted, _see_ Mil.

R. Evid. 505; 506.

### (b) Production of entire statement.

If the entire contents of the statement relate to the subject matter

 concerning which the witness has testified, the military judge shall order

that the statement be delivered to the moving party.

### (c) Production of excised statement.

If the party who called the witness claims that the statement contains

matter that does not relate to the subject matter concerning which the witness

has testified, the military judge shall order that it be delivered to the

military judge. Upon inspection, the military judge shall excise the portions

of the statement that do not relate to the subject matter concerning which

the witness has testified, and shall order that the statement, with such

material excised, be delivered to the moving party. Any portion of a statement

that is withheld from an accused over objection shall be preserved by the

trial counsel, and, in the event of a conviction, shall be made available

to the reviewing authorities for the purpose of determining the correctness

of the decision to excise the portion of the statement.

### (d) Recess for examination of the statement.

Upon delivery of the statement to the moving party, the military

 judge may recess the trial for the examination of the statement and preparation

for its use in the trial.

### (e) Remedy for failure to produce statement.

If the other party elects not to comply with an order to deliver

a statement to the moving party, the military judge shall order that the

testimony of the witness be disregarded by the trier of fact and that the

trial proceed, or, if it is the trial counsel who elects not to comply, shall

declare a mistrial if required in the interest of justice.

### (f) Definition.

As used in this rule, a "statement" of a witness means:

(1) A written statement made by the witness that is signed or otherwise

 adopted or approved by the witness;

(2) A substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by the

 witness that is recorded contemporaneously with the making of the oral statement

and contained in a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording

or a transcription thereof; or

(3) A statement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription thereof,

 made by the witness to a Federal grand jury.

## Rule 914A. Use of remote live testimony of a child

### (a) General procedures.

A child shall be allowed to testify out of the presence of the

accused after the military judge has determined that the requirements of

Mil. R. Evid. 611(d)(3) have been satisfied. The procedure used to take such

 testimony will be determined by the military judge based upon the exigencies

 of the situation. At a minimum, the following procedures

shall be observed:

(1) The witness shall testify from a remote location outside the courtroom;

(2) Attendance at the remote location shall be limited to the child,

 counsel for each side (not including an accused pro se), equipment operators,

and other persons, such as an attendant for the child, whose presence is

deemed necessary by the military judge;

(3) Sufficient monitors shall be placed in the courtroom to allow viewing

 and hearing of the testimony by the military judge, the accused, the members,

the court reporter and the public;

(4) The voice of the military judge shall be transmitted into the remote

 location to allow control of the proceedings; and

(5) The accused shall be permitted private, contemporaneous communication

 with his counsel.

### (b) Definition.

As used in this rule, "remote live testimony" includes, but is not limited to, testimony by videoteleconference, closed circuit television, or similar technology.

### (c) Prohibitions.

The procedures described above shall not be used where the accused

 elects to absent himself from the courtroom pursuant to R.C.M. 804(c).

#### Discussion

For purposes of this rule, unlike R.C.M. 914B, remote means or similar technology does not include receiving testimony by telephone where the parties cannot see and hear each other.

## Rule 914B. Use of remote testimony

### (a) General procedures.

The military judge shall determine the procedures used to take testimony via remote means. At a minimum, all parties shall be able to hear each other, those in attendance at the remote site shall be identified, and the accused shall be permitted private, contemporaneous communication with his counsel.

#### (b) Definition.

As used in this rule, testimony via "remote means" includes, but is not limited to, testimony by videoteleconference, closed circuit television, telephone, or similar technology.

##### Discussion

This rule applies for all witness testimony other than child witness testimony specifically covered by Mil. R. Evid. 611(d) and R.C.M. 914A.  When utilizing testimony via remote means, military justice practitioners are encouraged to consult the procedure used in _In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation_, 129 F.R.D. 424 (D.P.R. 1989) and to read _United States v. Gigante_, 166 F.3d 75 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1114 (2000).

## Rule 915. Mistrial

### (a) In general.

The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, declare a mistrial

 when such action is manifestly necessary in the interest of justice because

of circumstances arising during the proceedings which cast substantial doubt

upon the fairness of the proceedings. A mistrial may be declared as to some

or all charges, and as to the entire proceedings or as to only the proceedings

after findings.

#### Discussion

The power to grant a mistrial should be used with great caution,

 under urgent circumstances, and for plain and obvious reasons. As examples,

a mistrial may be appropriate when inadmissible matters so prejudicial that

a curative instruction would be inadequate are brought to the attention of

the members or when members engage in prejudicial misconduct. Also a mistrial

is appropriate when the proceedings must be terminated because of a legal

defect, such as a jurisdictional defect, which can be cured; for example,

when the referral is jurisdictionally defective. _See also_ R.C.M.

 905(g) concerning the effect of rulings in one proceeding on later proceedings.

### (b) Procedure.

On motion for a mistrial or when it otherwise appears that grounds

 for a mistrial may exist, the military judge shall inquire into the views

of the parties on the matter and then decide the matter as an interlocutory

question.

#### Discussion

Except in a special court-martial without a military judge, the

 hearing on a mistrial should be conducted out of the presence of the members.

### (c) Effect of declaration of mistrial.

#### (1) Withdrawal of charges.

A declaration of a mistrial shall have the effect of withdrawing

the affected charges and specifications from the court-martial.

##### Discussion

Upon declaration of a mistrial, the affected charges are returned

to the convening authority who may refer them anew or otherwise dispose of

them. _See_ R.C.M. 401-407.

#### (2) Further proceedings.

A declaration of a mistrial shall not prevent trial by another

court-martial on the affected charges and specifications except when the

mistrial was declared after jeopardy attached and before findings, and the

declaration was:

(A) An abuse of discretion and without the consent of the defense; or

(B) The direct result of intentional prosecutorial misconduct designed

to necessitate a mistrial.

## Rule 916. Defenses

### (a) In general.

As used in this rule, "defenses" includes any special

 defense which, although not denying that the accused committed the objective

 acts constituting the offense charged, denies, wholly or partially, criminal

responsibility for those acts.

#### Discussion

Special defenses are also called "affirmative defenses."



"Alibi" and "good character" are not special defenses,

as they operate to deny that the accused committed one or more of the acts

 constituting the offense. As to evidence of the accused's good character,

 _see_ Mil. R. Evid. 404(a)(1). _See_ R.C.M.

701(b)(1) concerning notice of alibi.

### (b) Burden of proof.

#### (1) General rule.

Except as listed below in paragraphs (2) and (3), the prosecution shall have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense did not exist.

##### (2) Lack of mental responsibility.

The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.

###### (3) Mistake of fact as to age.

In the defense of mistake of fact as to age as described in Article 120b(d)(2) in a prosecution of a child sexual offense, the accused has the burden of proving mistake of fact as to age by a preponderance of the evidence.

### Discussion

A defense may be raised by evidence presented by the defense, the

 prosecution, or the court-martial. For example, in a prosecution for assault,

 testimony by prosecution witnesses that the victim brandished a weapon toward

the accused may raise a defense of self-defense. _ See_ subsection

(e) below. More than one defense may be raised as to a particular offense.

The defenses need not necessarily be consistent.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 920(e)(3) concerning instructions on defenses.

### (c) Justification.

A death, injury, or other act caused or done in the proper performance

of a legal duty is justified and not unlawful.

#### Discussion

The duty may be imposed by statute, regulation, or order. For example,

the use of force by a law enforcement officer when reasonably necessary in

the proper execution of a lawful apprehension is justified because the duty

to apprehend is imposed by lawful authority. Also, killing an enemy combatant

in battle is justified.

### (d) Obedience to orders.

It is a defense to any offense that the accused was acting pursuant

 to orders unless the accused knew the orders to be unlawful or a person of

 ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawful.

#### Discussion

Ordinarily the lawfulness of an order is finally decided by the

 military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 801(e). An exception might exist

 when the sole issue is whether the person who gave the order in fact occupied

a certain position at the time.

  An act performed pursuant

to a lawful order is justified. _See_ subsection (c) of this

rule. An act performed pursuant to an unlawful order is excused unless the

accused knew it to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding

would have known it to be unlawful.

### (e) Self-defense.

#### (1) Homicide or assault cases involving deadly force.

It is a defense to a homicide, assault involving deadly force, or

 battery involving deadly force that the accused:

(A) Apprehended, on reasonable grounds, that death or grievous bodily

 harm was about to be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and

(B) Believed that the force the accused used was necessary for protection

 against death or grievous bodily harm.

###### Discussion

The words "involving deadly force" described the factual

 circumstances of the case, not specific assault offenses. If the accused

is charged with simple assault, battery or any form of aggravated assault,

or if simple assault, battery or any form of aggravated assault is in issue

as a lesser included offense, the accused may rely on this subsection if

the test specified in subsections (A) and (B) is satisfied.

  The

test for the first element of self-defense is objective. Thus, the accused's

apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm must have been one which a

reasonable, prudent person would have held under the circumstances. Because

this test is objective, such matters as intoxication or emotional instability

 of the accused are irrelevant. On the other hand, such matters as the relative

 height, weight, and general build of the accused and the alleged victim,

and the possibility of safe retreat are ordinarily among the circumstances

which should be considered in determining the reasonableness of the apprehension

of death or grievous bodily harm.

  The test for the second

element is entirely subjective. The accused is not objectively limited to

the use of reasonable force. Accordingly, such matters as the accused's emotional

control, education, and intelligence are relevant in determining the accused's

actual belief as to the force necessary to repel the attack.

  _

See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 404(a)(2) as to evidence concerning the character

 of the victim.

#### (2) Certain aggravated assault cases.

It is a defense to assault with a dangerous weapon or means likely

to produce death or grievous bodily harm that the accused:

(A) Apprehended, on reasonable grounds, that bodily harm was about to

be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and

(B) In order to deter the assailant, offered but did not actually apply

 or attempt to apply such means or force as would be likely to cause death

or grievous bodily harm.

###### Discussion

The principles in the discussion of subsection (e)(1) of this rule

 concerning reasonableness of the apprehension of bodily harm apply here.

  If,

as a result of the accused's offer of a means or force likely to produce

grievous bodily harm, the victim was killed or injured unintentionally by

the accused, this aspect of self-defense may operate in conjunction with

the defense of accident (_see_ subsection (f) of this rule)

to excuse the accused's acts. The death or injury must have been an unintended

and unexpected result of the accused's exercise of the right of self-defense.

#### (3) Other assaults.

It is a defense to any assault punishable under Article 90, 91,

or 128 and not listed in subsections (e)(1) or (2) of this rule that the

accused:

(A) Apprehended, upon reasonable grounds, that bodily harm was about

to be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and

(B) Believed that the force that accused used was necessary for protection

against bodily harm, provided that the force used by the accused was less

than force reasonably likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.

###### Discussion

The principles in the discussion under subsection (e)(1) apply here.

  If,

in using only such force as the accused was entitled to use under this aspect

of self-defense, death or serious injury to the victim results, this aspect

of self-defense may operate in conjunction with the defense of accident

(_see_ subsection (f) of this rule) to excuse the accused's

acts. The death or serious injury must have been an unintended and unexpected

result of the accused's proper exercise of the right of self-defense.

#### (4) Loss of right to self-defense.

The right to self-defense is lost and the defenses described in

 subsections (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this rule shall not apply if the accused

was an aggressor, engaged in mutual combat, or provoked the attack which

gave rise to the apprehension, unless the accused had withdrawn in good faith

after the aggression, combat, or provocation and before the offense alleged

occurred.

##### Discussion

A person does not become an aggressor or provocateur merely because

 that person approaches another to seek an interview, even if the approach

is not made in a friendly manner. For example, one may approach another

and demand an explanation of offensive words or redress of a complaint. If

the approach is made in a nonviolent manner, the right to self-defense is

not lost.

  Failure to retreat, when retreat is possible,

does not deprive the accused of the right to self-defense if the accused

was lawfully present. The availability of avenues of retreat is one factor

 which may be considered in addressing the reasonableness of the accused's

 apprehension of bodily harm and the sincerity of the accused's belief that

the force used was necessary for self-protection.

#### (5) Defense of another.

The principles of self-defense under subsection (e)(1) through (4)

of this rule apply to defense of another. It is a defense to homicide, attempted

homicide, assault with intent to kill, or any assault under Article 90,

91, or 128 that the accused acted in defense of another, provided that the

 accused may not use more force than the person defended was lawfully entitled

to use under the circumstances.

##### Discussion

The accused acts at the accused's peril when defending another.

Thus, if the accused goes to the aid of an apparent assault victim, the

accused is guilty of any assault the accused commits on the apparent assailant

if, unbeknownst to the accused, the apparent victim was in fact the aggressor

and not entitled to use self-defense.

### (f) Accident.

A death, injury, or other event which occurs as the unintentional

and unexpected result of doing a lawful act in a lawful manner is an accident

and excusable.

#### Discussion

The defense of accident is not available when the act which caused

 the death, injury, or event was a negligent act.

### (g) Entrapment.

It is a defense that the criminal design or suggestion to commit

the offense originated in the Government and the accused had no predisposition

to commit the offense.

#### Discussion

The "Government" includes agents of the Government and

 persons cooperating with them (for example, informants). The fact that persons

acting for the Government merely afford opportunities or facilities for

the commission of the offense does not constitute entrapment. Entrapment

occurs only when the criminal conduct is the product of the creative activity

of law enforcement officials.

  When the defense of entrapment

is raised, evidence of uncharged misconduct by the accused of a nature similar

to that charged is admissible to show predisposition. _See_ Mil.

R. Evid. 404(b).

### (h) Coercion or duress.

It is a defense to any offense except killing an innocent person

that the accused's participation in the offense was caused by a reasonable

apprehension that the accused or another innocent person would be immediately

killed or would immediately suffer serious bodily injury if the accused did

not commit the act. The apprehension must reasonably continue throughout

the commission of the act. If the accused has any reasonable opportunity

to avoid committing the act without subjecting the accused or another innocent

person to the harm threatened, this defense shall not apply.

#### Discussion

The immediacy of the harm necessary may vary with the circumstances.

 For example, a threat to kill a person's wife the next day may be immediate

if the person has no opportunity to contact law enforcement officials or

otherwise protect the intended victim or avoid committing the offense before

then.

### (i) Inability.

It is a defense to refusal or failure to perform a duty that the

 accused was, through no fault of the accused, not physically or financially

able to perform the duty.

#### Discussion

The test of inability is objective in nature. The accused's opinion

 that a physical impairment prevented performance of the duty will not suffice

unless the opinion is reasonable under all the circumstances.

  If

the physical or financial inability of the accused occurred through the accused's

own fault or design, it is not a defense. For example, if the accused, having

knowledge of an order to get a haircut, spends money on other nonessential

items, the accused's inability to pay for the haircut would not be a defense.

### (j) Ignorance or mistake of fact.

#### (1) Generally.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, it is a defense

to an offense that the accused held, as a result of ignorance or mistake,

an incorrect belief of the true circumstances such that, if the circumstances

 were as the accused believed them, the accused would not be guilty of the

 offense. If the ignorance or mistake goes to an element requiring premeditation,

specific intent, willfulness, or knowledge of a particular fact, the ignorance

or mistake need only have existed in the mind of the accused. If the ignorance

or mistake goes to any other element requiring only general intent or knowledge,

the ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of the accused and

must have been reasonable under all the circumstances. However, if the accused's

 knowledge or intent is immaterial as to an element, then ignorance or mistake

 is not a defense.

#### (2) Child Sexual Offenses.

It is a defense to a prosecution for Article 120b(b), sexual assault of a child, and Article 120b(c), sexual abuse of a child, that, at the time of the offense, the accused reasonably believed that the child had attained the age of 16 years, if the child had in fact attained at least the age of 12 years. The accused must prove this defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

##### Discussion

Examples of ignorance or mistake which need only exist in fact include: ignorance of the fact that the person assaulted was an officer; belief that property allegedly stolen belonged to the accused; belief that a controlled substance was really sugar.

  Examples of ignorance or mistake which must be reasonable as well as actual include: belief that the accused charged with unauthorized absence had permission to go; belief that the accused had a medical "profile" excusing shaving as otherwise required by regulation. Some offenses require special standards of conduct (see, for example, paragraph 68, Part IV, Dishonorable failure to maintain sufficient funds); the element of reasonableness must be applied in accordance with the standards imposed by such offenses.

  Examples of offenses in which the accused's intent or knowledge is immaterial include: any rape of a child, or any sexual assault or sexual abuse of a child when the child is under 12 years old. However, such ignorance or mistake may be relevant in extenuation and mitigation.

  _See_ subsection (l)(1) of this rule concerning ignorance or mistake of law.

### (k) Lack of mental responsibility.

#### (1) Lack of mental responsibility.

It is an affirmative defense to any offense that, at the time of

the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result

of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature

 and quality or the wrongfulness of his or her acts. Mental disease or defect

 does not otherwise constitute a defense.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 706 concerning sanity inquiries; R.C.M.

909 concerning the capacity of the accused to stand trial; and R.C.M. 1102A

concerning any post-trial hearing for an accused found not guilty only by

reason of lack of mental responsibility.

#### (2) Partial mental responsibility.

A mental condition not amounting to a lack of mental responsibility

 under subsection (k)(1) of this rule is not an affirmative defense.

##### Discussion

Evidence of a mental condition not amounting to a lack of mental

responsibility may be admissible as to whether the accused entertained a state

of mind necessary to be proven as an element of the offense. The defense

must notify the trial counsel before the beginning of trial on the merits

if the defense intends to introduce expert testimony as to the accused's mental

condition. _See_ R.C.M. 701(b)(2).

#### (3) Procedure.

##### (A) Presumption.

The accused is presumed to have been mentally responsible at the

time of the alleged offense. This presumption continues until the accused

establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or she was not mentally

responsible at the time of the alleged offense.

###### Discussion

The accused is presumed to be mentally responsible, and this presumption

continues throughout the proceedings unless the finder of fact determines

that the accused has proven lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing

evidence. _See_ subsection (b) of this rule.

##### (B) Inquiry.

If a question is raised concerning the mental responsibility of

the accused, the military judge shall rule finally whether to direct an

inquiry under R.C.M. 706. In a special court-martial without a military judge,

 the president shall rule finally except to the extent that the question is

one of fact, in which case the president rules subject to objection by any

member.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(3) for the procedures for voting

on rulings of the president of a special court-martial without a military

judge.

  If an inquiry is directed, priority should be given

to it.

##### (C) Determination.

The issue of mental responsibility shall not be considered as an

 interlocutory question.

### (l) Not defenses generally.

#### (1) Ignorance or mistake of law.

Ignorance or mistake of law, including general orders or regulations,

 ordinarily is not a defense.

##### Discussion

For example, ignorance that it is a crime to possess marijuana is

not a defense to wrongful possession of marijuana.

  Ignorance

or mistake of law may be a defense in some limited circumstances. If the

accused, because of a mistake as to a separate nonpenal law, lacks the criminal

intent or state of mind necessary to establish guilt, this may be a defense.

For example, if the accused, under mistaken belief that the accused is entitled

to take an item under property law, takes an item, this mistake of law (as

to the accused's legal right) would, if genuine, be a defense to larceny.

On the other hand, if the accused disobeyed an order, under the actual but

mistaken belief that the order was unlawful, this would not be a defense

because the accused's mistake was as to the order itself, and not as to a

separate nonpenal law. Also, mistake of law may be a defense when the mistake

results from reliance on the decision or pronouncement of an authorized public

 official or agency. For example, if an accused, acting on the advice of an

 official responsible for administering benefits that the accused is entitled

to those benefits, applies for and receives those benefits, the accused

may have a defense even though the accused was not legally eligible for the

 benefits. On the other hand, reliance on the advice of counsel that a certain

course of conduct is legal is not, of itself, a defense.

#### (2) Voluntary intoxication.

Voluntary intoxication, whether caused by alcohol or drugs, is not

a defense. However, evidence of any degree of voluntary intoxication may

be introduced for the purpose of raising a reasonable doubt as to the existence

of actual knowledge, specific intent, willfulness, or a premeditated design

to kill, if actual knowledge, specific intent, willfulness, or premeditated

design to kill is an element of the offense.

##### Discussion

Intoxication may reduce premeditated murder to unpremeditated murder,

 but it will not reduce murder to manslaughter or any other lesser offense. _

See_ paragraph 43c(2)(c), Part IV.

  Although voluntary

intoxication is not a defense, evidence of voluntary intoxication may be

admitted in extenuation.

## Rule 917. Motion for a finding of not guilty

### (a) In general.

The military judge, on motion by the accused or _sua sponte

_, shall enter a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses charged

after the evidence on either side is closed and before findings on the general

issue of guilt are announced if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a

conviction of the offense affected. If a motion for a finding of not guilty

at the close of the prosecution's case is denied, the defense may offer

evidence on that offense without having reserved the right to do so.

### (b) Form of motion.

The motion shall specifically indicate wherein the evidence is

insufficient.

### (c) Procedure.

Before ruling on a motion for a finding of not guilty, whether made

 by counsel or _sua sponte_, the military judge shall give

each party an opportunity to be heard on the matter.

#### Discussion

The military judge ordinarily should permit the trial counsel to

 reopen the case as to the insufficiency specified in the motion.

  _

 See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(2) and (3) for additional procedures to be followed

in a special court-martial without a military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 1102(b)(2) for the military judge's authority, upon motion or sua sponte, to enter finding of not guilty after findings but prior to authentication of the record.

### (d) Standard.

A motion for a finding of not guilty shall be granted only in the

 absence of some evidence which, together with all reasonable inferences

and applicable presumptions, could reasonably tend to establish every essential

element of an offense charged. The evidence shall be viewed in the light

most favorable to the prosecution, without an evaluation of the credibility

of witnesses.

### (e) Motion as to greater offense.

A motion for a finding of not guilty may be granted as to part of

a specification and, if appropriate, the corresponding charge, as long as

a lesser offense charged is alleged in the portion of the specification

as to which the motion is not granted. In such cases, the military judge shall

 announce that a finding of not guilty has been granted as to specified language

in the specification and, if appropriate, corresponding charge. In cases

before members, the military judge shall instruct the members accordingly,

so that any findings later announced will not be inconsistent with the granting

of the motion.

### (f) Effect of ruling.

A ruling granting a motion for a finding of not guilty is final

when announced and may not be reconsidered. Such a ruling is a finding of

not guilty of the affected specification, or affected portion thereof, and,

when appropriate, of the corresponding charge. A ruling denying a motion

for a finding of not guilty may be reconsidered at any time prior to authentication

of the record of trial.

### (g) Effect of denial on review.

If all the evidence admitted before findings, regardless by whom

 offered, is sufficient to sustain findings of guilty, the findings need

not be set aside upon review solely because the motion for finding of not

guilty should have been granted upon the state of the evidence when it was

 made.

## Rule 918. Findings

### (a) General findings.

The general findings of a court-martial state whether the accused

is guilty of each offense charged. If two or more accused are tried together,

separate findings as to each shall be made.

#### (1) As to a specification.

General findings as to a specification may be: guilty; not guilty

of an offense as charged, but guilty of a named lesser included offense;

guilty with exceptions, with or without substitutions, not guilty of the

exceptions, but guilty of the substitutions, if any; not guilty only by reason

of lack of mental responsibility; or, not guilty. Exceptions and substitutions

may not be used to substantially change the nature of the offense or to

increase the seriousness of the offense or the maximum punishment for it.

##### Discussion

 _Exceptions and Substitutions._ One or more words or figures may be excepted from a specification and, when necessary, others substituted, if the remaining language of the specification, with or without substitutions, states an offense by the accused which is punishable by the court-martial. Changing the date or place of the offense may, but does not necessarily, change the nature or identity of an offense.

  If A and B are joint accused and A is convicted but B is acquitted of an offense charged, A should be found guilty by excepting the name of B from the specification as well as any other words indicating the offense was a joint one.

  _Lesser Included Offenses._  If the evidence fails to prove the offense charged but does prove an offense necessarily included in the offense charged, the fact finder may find the accused not guilty of the offense charged but guilty of the lesser included offense. _See_ paragraph 3 of Part IV concerning lesser included offenses.

  _Offenses arising from the same act or transaction._ The accused may be found guilty of two or more offenses arising from the same act or transaction, whether or not the offenses are separately punishable. _But see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12); 907(b)(3)(B); 1003(c)(1)(C).

#### (2) As to a charge.

 General findings as to a charge may be: guilty; not guilty, but

 guilty of a violation of Article ; not guilty only

by reason of lack of mental responsibility; or not guilty.

##### Discussion

Where there are two or more specifications under one charge, conviction

of any of those specifications requires a finding of guilty of the corresponding

charge. Under such circumstances any findings of not guilty as to the other

specifications do not affect that charge. If the accused is found guilty

of one specification and of a lesser included offense prohibited by a different

Article as to another specification under the same charge, the findings

as to the corresponding charge should be:

"Of the Charge as to specification

1: Guilty; as to specification 2: not guilty, but guilty of a violation of

Article ."

  An attempt should be found

as a violation of Article 80 unless the attempt is punishable under Articles

85, 94, 100, 104, or 128, in which case it should be found as a violation

of that Article.

  A court-martial may not find an offense

as a violation of an article under which it was not charged solely for the

purpose of increasing the authorized punishment or for the purpose of adjudging

less than the prescribed mandatory punishment.

### (b) Special findings.

In a trial by court-martial composed of military judge alone, the

 military judge shall make special findings upon request by any party. Special

findings may be requested only as to matters of fact reasonably in issue

as to an offense and need be made only as to offenses of which the accused

was found guilty. Special findings may be requested at any time before general

findings are announced. Only one set of special findings may be requested

by a party in a case. If the request is for findings on specific matters,

the military judge may require that the request be written. Special findings

may be entered orally on the record at the court-martial or in writing during

or after the court-martial, but in any event shall be made before authentication

and included in the record of trial.

#### Discussion

Special findings ordinarily include findings as to the elements

of the offenses of which the accused has been found guilty, and any affirmative

defense relating thereto.

  _See also_ R.C.M.

905(d); Mil. R. Evid. 304(d)(4); 311(d)(4); 321(f) concerning other findings

to be made by the military judge.

  Members may not make special

findings.

### (c) Basis of findings.

Findings may be based on direct or circumstantial evidence. Only

 matters properly before the court-martial on the merits of the case may

be considered. A finding of guilty of any offense may be reached only when

the factfinder is satisfied that guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable

 doubt.

#### Discussion

Direct evidence is evidence which tends directly to prove or disprove

 a fact in issue (for example, an element of the offense charged). Circumstantial

evidence is evidence which tends directly to prove not a fact in issue but

some other fact or circumstance from which, either alone or together with

other facts or circumstances, one may reasonably infer the existence or nonexistence

 of a fact in issue. There is no general rule for determining or comparing

the weight to be given to direct or circumstantial evidence.

  A

reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense. A reasonable

doubt is not mere conjecture; it is an honest, conscientious doubt suggested

by the evidence, or lack of it, in the case. An absolute or mathematical

certainty is not required. The rule as to reasonable doubt extends to every

element of the offense. It is not necessary that each particular fact advanced

by the prosecution which is not an element be proved beyond a reasonable

doubt.

  The factfinder should consider the inherent probability

or improbability of the evidence, using common sense and knowledge of human

nature, and should weigh the credibility of witnesses. A fact finder may

properly believe one witness and disbelieve others whose testimony conflicts

with that of the one. A factfinder may believe part of the testimony of a

witness and disbelieve other parts.

  Findings of guilty may

not be based solely on the testimony of a witness other than the accused

which is self-contradictory, unless the contradiction is adequately explained

by the witness. Even if apparently credible and corroborated, the testimony

of an accomplice should be considered with great caution.

## Rule 919. Argument by counsel on findings

### (a) In general.

After the closing of evidence, trial counsel shall be permitted

to open the argument. The defense counsel shall be permitted to reply. Trial

counsel shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal.

### (b) Contents.

Arguments may properly include reasonable comment on the evidence

in the case, including inferences to be drawn therefrom, in support of a

party's theory of the case.

#### Discussion

The military judge may exercise reasonable control over argument.

 _See_ R.C.M. 801(a)(3).



  Argument may include

comment about the testimony, conduct, motives, interests, and biases of

witnesses to the extent supported by the evidence. Counsel should not express

a personnel belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony

or evidence or the guilt or innocence of the accused, nor should counsel

make arguments calculated to inflame passions or prejudices. In argument

counsel may treat the testimony of witnesses as conclusively establishing

the facts related by the witnesses. Counsel may not cite legal authorities

or the facts of other cases when arguing to members on findings.

  Trial

counsel may not comment on the accused's exercise of the right against self-incrimination

 or the right to counsel. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 512. Trial counsel

 may not argue that the prosecution's evidence is unrebutted if the only

rebuttal could come from the accused. When the accused is on trial for several

offenses and testifies only as to some of the offenses, trial counsel may

not comment on the accused's failure to testify as to the others. When the

accused testifies on the merits regarding an offense charged, trial counsel

may comment on the accused's failure in that testimony to deny or explain

specific incriminating facts that the evidence for the prosecution tends

to establish regarding that offense.

  Trial counsel may

not comment on the failure of the defense to call witnesses or of the accused

to testify at the Article 32 preliminary hearing or upon the probable effect of

the court-martial's findings on relations between the military and civilian

communities.

  The rebuttal argument of trial counsel is generally

limited to matters argued by the defense. If trial counsel is permitted

to introduce new matter in closing argument, the defense should be allowed

 to reply in rebuttal. However, this will not preclude trial counsel from

 presenting a final argument.

### (c) Waiver of objection to improper argument.

Failure to object to improper argument before the military judge

 begins to instruct the members on findings shall constitute waiver of the

objection.

#### Discussion

If an objection that an argument is improper is sustained, the

military judge should immediately instruct the members that the argument

was improper and that they must disregard it. In extraordinary cases improper

argument may require a mistrial. _See_ R.C.M. 915. The military

judge should be alert to improper argument and take appropriate action when

necessary.

## Rule 920. Instructions on findings

### (a) In general.

The military judge shall give the members appropriate instructions

on findings.

#### Discussion

Instructions consist of a statement of the issues in the case and

an explanation of the legal standards and procedural requirements by which

the members will determine findings. Instructions should be tailored to

fit the circumstances of the case, and should fairly and adequately cover

the issues presented.

### (b) When given.

Instructions on findings shall be given before or after arguments

by counsel, or at both times, and before the members close to deliberate

on findings, but the military judge may, upon request of the members, any

party, or _sua sponte_, give additional instructions at a

later time.

#### Discussion

After members have reached a finding on a specification, instructions

 may not be given on an offense included therein which was not described

in an earlier instruction unless the finding is illegal. This is true even

if the finding has not been announced. When instructions are to be given

is a matter within the sole discretion of the military trial judge.

### (c) Requests for instructions.

At the close of the evidence or at such other time as the military

 judge may permit, any party may request that the military judge instruct

the members on the law as set forth in the request. The military judge may

require the requested instruction to be written. Each party shall be given

the opportunity to be heard on any proposed instruction on findings before

it is given. The military judge shall inform the parties of the proposed

action on such requests before their closing arguments.

#### Discussion

Requests for and objections to instructions should be resolved at

an Article 39(a) session. _But see_ R.C.M 801(e)(3); 803.

  If

an issue has been raised, ordinarily the military judge must instruct on

the issue when requested to do so. The military judge is not required to

give the specific instruction requested by counsel, however, as long as

the issue is adequately covered in the instructions.

  The

military judge should not identify the source of any instruction when addressing

the members.

  All written requests for instructions should

be marked as appellate exhibits, whether or not they are given.

### (d) How given.

Instructions on findings shall be given orally on the record in

the presence of all parties and the members. Written copies of the instructions,

or, unless a party objects, portions of them, may also be given to the members

for their use during deliberations.

#### Discussion

A copy of any written instructions delivered to the members should

be marked as an appellate exhibit.

### (e) Required instructions.

Instructions on findings shall include:

(1) A description of the elements of each offense charged, unless findings

on such offenses are unnecessary because they have been entered pursuant

to a plea of guilty;

(2) A description of the elements of each lesser included offense in

 issue, unless trial of a lesser included offense is barred by the statute

of limitations (Article 43) and the accused refuses to waive the bar;

(3) A description of any special defense under R.C.M. 916 in issue;

(4) A direction that only matters properly before the court-martial

may be considered;

(5) A charge that-

(A) The accused must be presumed to be innocent until the accused's

guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;

(B) In the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as

to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the

accused and the accused must be acquitted;

(C) If, when a lesser included offense is in issue, there is a reasonable

 doubt as to the degree of guilt of the accused, the finding must be in a

lower degree as to which there is not reasonable doubt; and

(D) The burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused is upon the Government. [When the issue of lack of mental responsibility is raised, add: The burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence is upon the accused. When the issue of mistake of fact under R.C.M. 916(j)(2) is raised, add: The accused has the burden of proving the defense of mistake of fact as to age by a preponderance of the evidence.]

(6) Directions on the procedures under R.C.M. 921 for deliberations

and voting; and

(7) Such other explanations, descriptions, or directions as may be

necessary and which are properly requested by a party or which the military

judge determines, _sua sponte_, should be given.

##### Discussion

A matter is "in issue" when some evidence, without regard

 to its source or credibility, has been admitted upon which members might

rely if they choose. An instruction on a lesser included offense is proper

when an element from the charged offense which distinguishes thatoffense

from the lesser offense is in dispute.

  _See_ R.C.M.

918(c) and discussion as to reasonable doubt and other matters relating

to the basis for findings which may be the subject of an instruction.

  Other

matters which may be the subject of instruction in appropriate cases included:

inferences (_see_ the explanations in Part IV concerning inferences

 relating to specific offenses); the limited purpose for which evidence was

admitted (regardless of whether such evidence was offered by the prosecution

of defense) (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 105); the effect of character

evidence (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 404; 405); the effect of judicial

notice (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 201, 201A); the weight to be

given a pretrial statement (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 340(e)); the

effect of stipulations (_see_ R.C.M. 811); that, when a guilty

plea to a lesser included offense has been accepted, the members should

accept as proved the matters admitted by the plea, but must determine whether

 the remaining elements are established; that a plea of guilty to one offense

 may not be the basis for inferring the existence of a fact or element of

another offense; the absence of the accused from trial should not be held

 against the accused; and that no adverse inferences may be drawn from an

 accused's failure to testify (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 301(g)).

  The

military judge may summarize and comment upon evidence in the case in instructions.

 In doing so, the military judge should present an accurate, fair, and dispassionate

statement of what the evidence shows; not depart from an impartial role;

not assume as true the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue when

the evidence is conflicting or disputed, or when there is no evidence to

support the matter; and make clear that the members must exercise their independent

judgment as to the facts.

### (f) Waiver.

Failure to object to an instruction or to omission of an instruction

 before the members close to deliberate constitutes waiver of the objection

in the absence of plain error. The military judge may require the party

objecting to specify of what respect the instructions given were improper.

The parties shall be given the opportunity to be heard on any objection outside

the presence of the members.

## Rule 921. Deliberations and voting on findings

### (a) In general.

After the military judge instructs the members on findings, the

 members shall deliberate and vote in a closed session. Only the members

shall be present during deliberations and voting. Superiority in rank shall

not be used in any manner in an attempt to control the independence of members

in the exercise of their judgment.

### (b) Deliberations.

Deliberations properly include full and free discussion of the merits

 of the case. Unless otherwise directed by the military judge, members may

take with them in deliberations their notes, if any, any exhibits admitted

in evidence, and any written instructions. Members may request that the court-martial

be reopened and that portions of the record be read to them or additional

evidence introduced. The military judge may, in the exercise of discretion,

grant such request.

### (c) Voting.

#### (1) Secret ballot.

 Voting on the findings for each charge and specification shall

be by secret written ballot. All members present shall vote.

#### (2) Numbers of votes required to convict.

##### (A) Death penalty mandatory.

A finding of guilty of an offense for which the death penalty is

 mandatory results only if all members present vote for a finding of guilty.

###### Discussion

Article 106 is the only offense under the code for which the death

 penalty is mandatory.

##### (B) Other offenses.

As to any offense for which the death penalty is not mandatory,

a finding of guilty results only if at least two-thirds of the members present

vote for a finding of guilty.

###### Discussion

In computing the number of votes required to convict, any fraction

of a vote is rounded up to the next whole number. For example, if there

are five members, the concurrence of at least four would be required to convict.

 The military judge should instruct the members on the specific number of

votes required to convict.

#### (3) Acquittal.

If fewer than two-thirds of the members present vote for a finding

of guilty-or, when the death penalty is mandatory, if fewer than all

the members present vote for a finding of guilty-a finding of not

guilty has resulted as to the charge or specification on which the vote was

taken.

#### (4) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.

When the defense of lack of mental responsibility is in issue under

 R.C.M. 916(k)(1), the members shall first vote on whether the prosecution

has proven the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. If at

least two-thirds of the members present (all members for offenses where the

death penalty is mandatory) vote for a finding of guilty, then the members

shall vote on whether the accused has proven lack of mental responsibility.

If a majority of the members present concur that the accused has proven lack

of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence, a finding of not

guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility results. If the vote

on lack of mental responsibility does not result in a finding of not guilty

only by reason of lack of mental responsibility, then the defense of lack

of mental responsibility has been rejected and the finding of guilty stands.

##### Discussion

If lack of mental responsibility is in issue with regard to more

than one specification, the members should determine the issue of lack of

mental responsibility on each specification separately.

#### (5) Included offenses.

Members shall not vote on a lesser included offense unless a finding

 of not guilty of the offense charged has been reached. If a finding of not

guilty of an offense charged has been reached the members shall vote on

each included offense on which they have been instructed, in order of severity

beginning with the most severe. The members shall continue the vote on each

included offense on which they have been instructed until a finding of guilty

results or findings of not guilty have been reached as to each such offense.

#### (6) Procedure for voting.

##### (A) Order.

Each specification shall be voted on separately before the corresponding

charge. The order of voting on several specifications under a charge or on

several charges shall be determined by the president unless a majority of

the members object.

##### (B) Counting votes.

The junior member shall collect the ballots and count the votes.

The president shall check the count and inform the other members of the

result.

###### Discussion

Once findings have been reached, they may be reconsidered only in

 accordance with R.C.M. 924.

### (d) Action after findings are reached.

After the members have reached findings on each charge and specification

before them, the court-martial shall be opened and the president shall inform

the military judge that findings have been reached. The military judge may,

in the presence of the parties, examine any writing which the president intends

to read to announce the findings and may assist the members in putting the

 findings in proper form. Neither that writing nor any oral or written clarification

or discussion concerning it shall constitute announcement of the findings.

#### Discussion

Ordinarily a findings worksheet should be provided to the members

as an aid to putting the findings in proper form. _See_ Appendix

10 for a format for findings. If the military judge examines any writing

by the members or otherwise assists them to put findings in proper form,

this must be done in an open session and counsel should be given the opportunity

to examine such a writing and to be heard on any instructions the military

judge may give. _See_ Article 39(b).

  The

president should not disclose any specific number of votes for or against

any finding.

## Rule 922. Announcement of findings

### (a) In general.

Findings shall be announced in the presence of all parties promptly

 after they have been determined.

#### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 10. A finding of an offense about

which no instructions were given is not proper.

### (b) Findings by members.

The president shall announce the findings by the members.

(1) If a finding is based on a plea of guilty, the president shall so

 state.

(2) In a capital case, if a finding of guilty is unanimous with respect

 to a capital offense, the president shall so state. This provision shall

not apply during reconsideration under R.C.M. 924(a) of a finding of guilty

previously announced in open court unless the prior finding was announced

as unanimous.

##### Discussion

If the findings announced are ambiguous, the military judge should

 seek clarification. _See also_ R.C.M. 924. A nonunanimous

finding of guilty as to a capital offense may be reconsidered, but not for

the purpose of rendering a unanimous verdict in order to authorize a capital

sentencing proceeding. The president shall not make a statement regarding

unanimity with respect to reconsideration of findings as to an offense in

which the prior findings were not unanimous.

### (c) Findings by military judge.

The military judge shall announce the findings when trial is by

 military judge alone or when findings may be entered upon R.C.M. 910(g).

### (d) Erroneous announcement.

If an error was made in the announcement of the findings of the

 court-martial, the error may be corrected by a new announcement in accordance

with this rule. The error must be discovered and the new announcement made

before the final adjournment of the court-martial in the case.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1102 concerning the action to be taken

if the error in the announcement is discovered after final adjournment.

### (e) Polling prohibited.

Except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 606, members may not be questioned

about their deliberations and voting.

## Rule 923. Impeachment of findings

Findings which are proper on their face may be impeached only when

 extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the attention

of a member, outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member,

or unlawful command influence was brought to bear upon any member.

### Discussion

Deliberations of the members ordinarily are not subject to disclosure. _

See_ Mil. R. Evid. 606. Unsound reasoning by a member, misconception

of the evidence, or misapplication of the law is not a proper basis for

challenging the findings. However, when a showing of a ground for impeaching

the verdict has been made, members may be questioned about such a ground.

The military judge determines, as an interlocutory matter, whether such

an inquiry will be conducted and whether a finding has been impeached.

## Rule 924. Reconsideration of findings

### (a) Time for reconsideration.

Members may reconsider any finding reached by them before such

finding is announced in open session.

### (b) Procedure.

Any member may propose that a finding be reconsidered. If such a

 proposal is made in a timely manner the question whether to reconsider shall

be determined in closed session by secret written ballot. Any finding of

not guilty shall be reconsidered if a majority vote for reconsideration.

Any finding of guilty shall be reconsidered if more than one-third of the

members vote for reconsideration. When the death penalty is mandatory, a

request by any member for reconsideration of a guilty finding requires reconsideration.

Any finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility

shall be reconsidered on the issue of the finding of guilty of the elements

if more than one-third of the members vote for reconsideration, and on the

issue of mental responsibility if a majority vote for reconsideration. If

a vote to reconsider a finding succeeds, the procedures in R.C.M. 921 shall

apply.

#### Discussion

After the initial secret ballot vote on a finding in closed session,

 no other vote may be taken on that finding unless a vote to reconsider succeeds.

### (c) Military judge sitting alone.

In trial by military judge alone, the military judge may reconsider

 any finding of guilty at any time before announcement of sentence and may

reconsider the issue of the finding of guilty of the elements in a finding

of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility at any time

before announcement of sentence or authentication of the record of trial

in the case of a complete acquittal.

# CHAPTER X. SENTENCING

## Rule 1001. Presentencing procedure

### (a) In general.

#### (1) Procedure.

After findings of guilty have been announced, the prosecution and

 defense may present matter pursuant to this rule to aid the court-martial

in determining an appropriate sentence. Such matter shall ordinarily be

presented in the following sequence-

(A) Presentation by trial counsel of:

(i) service data relating to the accused taken from the charge sheet;

(ii) personal data relating to the accused and of the character of the

 accused's prior service as reflected in the personnel records of the accused;

(iii) evidence of prior convictions, military or civilian;

(iv) evidence of aggravation; and

(v) evidence of rehabilitative potential.

(B) Victim's right to be reasonably heard. _See_ R.C.M. 1001A.

(C) Presentation by the defense of evidence in extenuation or mitigation or both.

(D) Rebuttal.

(E) Argument by trial counsel on sentence.

(F) Argument by defense counsel on sentence.

(G) Rebuttal arguments in the discretion of the military judge.

#### (2) Adjudging sentence.

A sentence shall be adjudged in all cases without unreasonable

delay.

#### (3) Advice and inquiry.

The military judge shall personally inform the accused of the right

 to present matters in extenuation and mitigation, including the right to

make a sworn or unsworn statement or to remain silent, and shall ask whether

the accused chooses to exercise those rights.

### (b) Matter to be presented by the prosecution.

#### (1) Service data from the charge sheet.

Trial counsel shall inform the court-martial of the data on the

 charge sheet relating to the pay and service of the accused and the duration

and nature of any pretrial restraint. In the discretion of the military

judge, this may be done by reading the material from the charge sheet or

by giving the court-martial a written statement of such matter. If the defense

objects to the data as being materially inaccurate or incomplete, or containing

specified objectionable matter, the military judge shall determine the issue.

 Objections not asserted are waived.

#### (2) Personal data and character of prior service of the accused.

Under regulations of the Secretary concerned, trial counsel may

 obtain and introduce from the personnel records of the accused evidence of

the accused's marital status; number of dependents, if any; and character

of prior service. Such evidence includes copies of reports reflecting the

past military efficiency, conduct, performance, and history of the accused

and evidence of any disciplinary actions including punishments under Article

15.

 "Personnel records of the accused" includes any

 records made or maintained in accordance with departmental regulations that

reflect the past military efficiency, conduct, performance, and history

of the accused. If the accused objects to a particular document as inaccurate

or incomplete in a specified respect, or as containing matter that is not

admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence, the matter shall be determined

by the military judge. Objections not asserted are waived.

#### (3) Evidence of prior convictions of the accused.

##### (A) In general.

The trial counsel may introduce evidence of military or civilian

 convictions of the accused. For purposes of this rule, there is a "conviction"

in a court-martial case when a sentence has been adjudged. In a civilian

case, a "conviction" includes any disposition following an initial

judicial determination or assumption of guilt, such as when guilt has been

established by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, regardless

of the subsequent disposition, sentencing procedure, or final judgment. However,

a "civilian conviction" does not include a diversion from the

 judicial process without a finding or admission of guilt; expunged convictions;

juvenile adjudications; minor traffic violations; foreign convictions; tribal

court convictions; or convictions reversed, vacated, invalidated or pardoned

because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating

the accused.

###### Discussion

A vacation of a suspended sentence (_see_ R.C.M.

1109) is not a conviction and is not admissible as such, but may be admissible

under subsection (b)(2) of this rule as reflective of the character of the

prior service of the accused.

  Whether a civilian conviction

is admissible is left to the discretion of the military judge. As stated

in the rule, a civilian "conviction" includes any disposition

following an initial judicial determination or assumption of guilt regardless

of the sentencing procedure and the final judgment following probation or

other sentence. Therefore, convictions may be admissible regardless of whether

a court ultimately suspended judgment upon discharge of the accused following

probation, permitted withdrawal of the guilty plea, or applies some other

form of alternative sentencing. Additionally, the term "conviction"

need not be taken to mean a final judgment of conviction and sentence.

##### (B) Pendency of appeal.

The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of

a conviction inadmissible except that a conviction by summary court-martial

or special court-martial without a military judge may not be used for purposes

of this rule until review has been completed pursuant to Article 64 or Article

66, if applicable. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.

##### (C) Method of proof.

Previous convictions may be proved by any evidence admissible under

 the Military Rules of Evidence.

###### Discussion

Normally, previous convictions may be proved by use of the personnel

 records of the accused, by the record of the conviction, or by the order

 promulgating the result of trial. _See_ DD Form 493 (Extract

of Military Records of Previous Convictions).

#### (4) Evidence in aggravation.

The trial counsel may present evidence as to any aggravating circumstances

directly relating to or resulting from the offenses of which the accused

has been found guilty. Evidence in aggravation includes, but is not limited

to, evidence of financial, social, psychological, and medical impact on or

cost to any person or entity who was the victim of an offense committed by

the accused and evidence of significant adverse impact on the mission, discipline,

or efficiency of the command directly and immediately resulting from the

accused's offense. In addition, evidence in aggravation may include evidence

that the accused intentionally selected any victim or any property as the

object of the offense because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion,

national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation of

any person. Except in capital cases a written or oral deposition taken in

accordance with R.C.M. 702 is admissible in aggravation.

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 1004 concerning aggravating circumstances

in capital cases.

#### (5) Evidence of rehabilitative potential.

Rehabilitative potential refers to the accused's potential to be

 restored, through vocational, correctional, or therapeutic training or other

 corrective measures to a useful and constructive place in society.

##### (A) In general.

The trial counsel may present, by testimony or oral deposition in

 accordance with R.C.M. 702(g)(1), evidence in the form of opinions concerning

 the accused's previous performance as a servicemember and potential for

rehabilitation.

##### (B) Foundation for opinion.

The witness or deponent providing opinion evidence regarding the

 accused's rehabilitative potential must possess sufficient information and

 knowledge about the accused to offer a rationally-based opinion that is

helpful to the sentencing authority. Relevant information and knowledge

include, but are not limited to, information and knowledge about the accused's

 character, performance of duty, moral fiber, determination to be rehabilitated,

 and nature and severity of the offense or offenses.

###### Discussion

_See generally_ Mil. R. Evid. 701, Opinion testimony

 by lay witnesses. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 703, Bases of

opinion testimony by experts, if the witness or deponent is testifying as

an expert. The types of information and knowledge reflected in this subparagraph

are illustrative only.

##### (C) Bases for opinion.

An opinion regarding the accused's rehabilitative potential must

be based upon relevant information and knowledge possessed by the witness

or deponent, and must relate to the accused's personal circumstances. The

opinion of the witness or deponent regarding the severity or nature of the

accused's offense or offenses may not serve as the principal basis for an

opinion of the accused's rehabilitative potential.

##### (D) Scope of opinion.

An opinion offered under this rule is limited to whether the accused

 has rehabilitative potential and to the magnitude or quality of any such

 potential. A witness may not offer an opinion regarding the appropriateness

of a punitive discharge or whether the accused should be returned to the

accused's unit.

###### Discussion

On direct examination, a witness or deponent may respond affirmatively

or negatively regarding whether the accused has rehabilitative potential.

 The witness or deponent may also opine succinctly regarding the magnitude

or quality of the accused rehabilitative potential; for example, the witness

or deponent may opine that the accused has "great" or "little"

rehabilitative potential. The witness or deponent, however, generally may

not further elaborate on the accused's rehabilitative potential, such as

describing the particular reasons for forming the opinion.

##### (E) Cross-examination.

On cross-examination, inquiry is permitted into relevant and specific

 instances of conduct.

##### (F) Redirect.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this rule, the scope of

opinion testimony permitted on redirect may be expanded, depending upon the

nature and scope of the cross-examination.

###### Discussion

For example, on redirect a witness or deponent may testify regarding

 specific instances of conduct when the cross-examination of the witness or

 deponent concerned specific instances of misconduct. Similarly, for example,

 on redirect a witness or deponent may offer an opinion on matters beyond

the scope of the accused's rehabilitative potential if an opinion about such

 matters was elicited during cross-examination of the witness or deponent

and is otherwise admissible.

### (c) Matter to be presented by the defense.

#### (1) In general.

The defense may present matters in rebuttal of any material presented

by the prosecution and may present matters in extenuation and mitigation

regardless whether the defense offered evidence before findings.

##### (A) Matter in extenuation.

Matter in extenuation of an offense serves to explain the circumstances

surrounding the commission of an offense, including those reasons for committing

the offense which do not constitute a legal justification or excuse.

##### (B) Matter in mitigation.

Matter in mitigation of an offense is introduced to lessen the

punishment to be adjudged by the court-martial, or to furnish grounds for

a recommendation of clemency. It includes the fact that nonjudicial punishment

 under Article 15 has been imposed for an offense growing out of the same

act or omission that constitutes the offense of which the accused has been

found guilty, particular acts of good conduct or bravery and evidence of

the reputation or record of the accused in the service for efficiency, fidelity,

subordination, temperance, courage, or any other trait that is desirable

in a servicemember.

#### (2) Statement by the accused.

##### (A) In general.

The accused may testify, make an unsworn statement, or both in

extenuation, in mitigation or to rebut matters presented by the prosecution,

or for all three purposes whether or not the accused testified prior to findings.

 The accused may limit such testimony or statement to any one or more of the

 specifications of which the accused has been found guilty. This subsection

does not permit the filing of an affidavit of the accused.

##### (B) Testimony of the accused.

The accused may give sworn oral testimony under this paragraph and

 shall be subject to cross-examination concerning it by the trial counsel

or examination on it by the court-martial, or both.

##### (C) Unsworn statement.

The accused may make an unsworn statement and may not be cross-examined

by the trial counsel upon it or examined upon it by the court-martial. The

prosecution may, however, rebut any statements of facts therein. The unsworn

statement may be oral, written, or both, and may be made by the accused,

by counsel, or both.

###### Discussion

An unsworn statement ordinarily should not include what is properly

 argument, but inclusion of such matter by the accused when personally making

an oral statement normally should not be grounds for stopping the statement.

#### (3) Rules of evidence relaxed.

The military judge may, with respect to matters in extenuation or

 mitigation or both, relax the rules of evidence. This may include admitting

 letters, affidavits, certificates of military and civil officers, and other

writings of similar authenticity and reliability.

### (d) Rebuttal and surrebuttal.

The prosecution may rebut matters presented by the defense. The

 defense in surrebuttal may then rebut any rebuttal offered by the prosecution.

 Rebuttal and surrebuttal may continue, in the discretion of the military

judge. If the Military Rules of Evidence were relaxed under subsection (c)(3)

of this rule, they may be relaxed during rebuttal and surrebuttal to the

same degree.

### (e) Production of witnesses.

#### (1) In general.

During the presentence proceedings, there shall be much greater

 latitude than on the merits to receive information by means other than testimony

presented through the personal appearance of witnesses. Whether a witness

shall be produced to testify during presentence proceedings is a matter within

the discretion of the military judge, subject to the limitations in subsection

(e)(2) of this rule.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 703 concerning the procedures for production

of witnesses.

#### (2) Limitations.

A witness may be produced to testify during presentence proceedings

 through a subpoena or travel orders at Government expense only if-

(A) The testimony expected to be offered by the witness is necessary

for consideration of a matter of substantial significance to a determination

of an appropriate sentence, including evidence necessary to resolve an alleged

inaccuracy or dispute as to a material fact;

(B) The weight or credibility of the testimony is of substantial significance

to the determination of an appropriate sentence;

(C) The other party refuses to enter into a stipulation of fact containing

the matters to which the witness is expected to testify, except in an extraordinary

case when such a stipulation of fact would be an insufficient substitute

for the testimony;

(D) Other forms of evidence, such as oral depositions, written interrogatories,

former testimony, or testimony by remote means would not be sufficient to meet the needs of the court-martial

in the determination of an appropriate sentence; and

(E) The significance of the personal appearance of the witness to the

 determination of an appropriate sentence, when balanced against the practical

difficulties of producing the witness, favors production of the witness.

Factors to be considered include the costs of producing the witness, the

timing of the request for production of the witness, the potential delay

in the presentencing proceeding that may be caused by the production of

the witness, and the likelihood of significant interference with military

operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.

###### Discussion

The procedures for receiving testimony via remote means and the definition thereof are contained in R.C.M. 914B.

### (f) Additional matters to be considered.

In addition to matters introduced under this rule, the court-martial

 may consider-

(1) That a plea of guilty is a mitigating factor; and

(2) Any evidence properly introduced on the merits before findings,

 including:

(A) Evidence of other offenses or acts of misconduct even if introduced

 for a limited purpose; and

(B) Evidence relating to any mental impairment or deficiency of the

 accused.

###### Discussion

The fact that the accused is of low intelligence or that, because

of a mental or neurological condition the accused's ability to adhere to

the right is diminished, may be extenuating. On the other hand, in determining

the severity of a sentence, the court-martial may consider evidence tending

to show that an accused has little regard for the rights of others.

### (g) Argument.

After introduction of matters relating to sentence under this rule,

 counsel for the prosecution and defense may argue for an appropriate sentence.

Trial counsel may not in argument purport to speak for the convening authority

or any higher authority, or refer to the views of such authorities or any

policy directive relative to punishment or to any punishment or quantum of

punishment greater than that court-martial may adjudge. Trial counsel may,

however, recommend a specific lawful sentence and may also refer to generally

accepted sentencing philosophies, including rehabilitation of the accused,

general deterrence, specific deterrence of misconduct by the accused, and

social retribution. Failure to object to improper argument before the military

judge begins to instruct the members on sentencing shall constitute waiver

of the objection.

#### Discussion

 A victim, victims' counsel, or designee has no right to present argument under this rule.

## Rule 1001A. Crime victims and presentencing

### (a) In general.

A crime victim of an offense of which the accused has been found guilty has the right to be reasonably heard at a sentencing hearing relating to that offense. A victim under this rule is not considered a witness for purposes of Article 42(b). Trial counsel shall ensure the victim is aware of the opportunity to exercise that right. If the victim exercises the right to be reasonably heard, the victim shall be called by the court. This right is independent of whether the victim testified during findings or is called to testify under R.C.M. 1001.

### (b) Definitions.

#### (1) Crime victim.

 For purposes of this rule, a "crime victim" is an individual who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense of which the accused was found guilty.

#### (2) Victim Impact.

 For the purposes of this rule, "victim impact" includes any financial, social, psychological, or medical impact on the victim directly relating to or arising from the offense of which the accused has been found guilty.

#### (3) Mitigation.

 For the purposes of this rule, "mitigation" includes a matter to lessen the punishment to be adjudged by the court-martial or to furnish grounds for a recommendation of clemency.

#### (4) Right to be reasonably heard.

##### (A) Capital cases.

 In capital cases, for purposes of this rule, the "right to be reasonably heard" means the right to make a sworn statement.

##### (B) Non-capital cases.

 In non-capital cases, for purposes of this rule, the "right to be reasonably heard" means the right to make a sworn or unsworn statement.

### (c) Content of statement.

 The content of statements made under subsections (d) and (e) of this rule may include victim impact or matters in mitigation.

### (d) Sworn statement.

 The victim may give a sworn statement under this rule and shall be subject to cross-examination concerning it by the trial counsel or defense counsel or examination on it by the court-martial, or all or any of the three. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the sworn statement may be made by the victim's designee appointed under R.C.M. 801(a)(6). Additionally, a victim under 18 years of age may elect to make a sworn statement.

### (e) Unsworn statement.

 The victim may make an unsworn statement and may not be cross-examined by the trial counsel or defense counsel upon it or examined upon it by the court-martial. The prosecution or defense may, however, rebut any statements of facts therein. The unsworn statement may be oral, written, or both. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the unsworn statement may be made by the victim's designee appointed under R.C.M. 801(a)(6). Additionally, a victim under 18 years of age may elect to make an unsworn statement.

#### (1) Procedure for presenting unsworn statement.

 After the announcement of findings, a victim who would like to present an unsworn statement shall provide a copy to the trial counsel, defense counsel, and military judge. The military judge may waive this requirement for good cause shown.

##### Discussion

 When the military judge waives the notice requirement under this rule, the military judge may conduct a session under Article 39(a) to ascertain the content of the victim's anticipated unsworn statement.

(2) Upon good cause shown, the military judge may permit the victim's counsel to deliver all or part of the victim's unsworn statement.

##### Discussion

 If there are numerous victims, the military judge may reasonably limit the form of the statements provided.

 A victim's unsworn statement should not exceed what is permitted under R.C.M. 1001A(c) and may not include a recommendation of a specific sentence. Upon objection by either party or _sua sponte_, a military judge may stop or interrupt a victim's unsworn statement that includes matters outside the scope of R.C.M. 1001A(c). A victim, victim's counsel, or designee has no separate right to present argument under R.C.M. 1001(g).

## Rule 1002. Sentence determination

Subject to limitations in this Manual, the sentence to be adjudged

is a matter within the discretion of the court-martial; except when a mandatory

minimum sentence is prescribed by the code, a court-martial may adjudge

any punishment authorized in this Manual, including the maximum punishment

or any lesser punishment, or may adjudge a sentence of no punishment.

### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning authorized punishments

and limitations on punishments. _See also_ R.C.M. 1004 in

capital cases.

## Rule 1003. Punishments

### (a) In general.

Subject to the limitations in this Manual, the punishments authorized

 in this rule may be adjudged in the case of any person found guilty of an

offense by a court-martial.

#### Discussion

"Any person" includes officers, enlisted persons, person

 in custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposed by a court-martial,

and, insofar as the punishments are applicable, any other person subject

to the code. _See_ R.C.M. 202.

### (b) Authorized punishments.

Subject to the limitations in this Manual, a court-martial may

adjudge only the following punishments:

#### (1) Reprimand.

A court-martial shall not specify the terms or wording of a reprimand.

A reprimand, if approved, shall be issued, in writing, by the convening authority;

##### Discussion

A reprimand adjudged by a court-martial is a punitive censure.

#### (2) Forfeiture of pay and allowances.

Unless a total forfeiture is adjudged, a sentence to forfeiture

shall state the exact amount in whole dollars to be forfeited each month

and the number of months the forfeitures will last.

 Allowances

shall be subject to forfeiture only when the sentence includes forfeiture

of all pay and allowances. The maximum authorized amount of a partial forfeiture

shall be determined by using the basic pay, retired pay, or retainer pay,

as applicable, or, in the case of reserve component personnel on inactive-duty,

compensation for periods of inactive-duty training, authorized by the cumulative

years of service of the accused, and, if no confinement is adjudged, any

sea or hardship duty pay. If the sentence also includes reduction in grade,

expressly or by operation of law, the maximum forfeiture shall be based on

the grade to which the accused is reduced.

##### Discussion

A forfeiture deprives the accused of the amount of pay (and allowances)

specified as it accrues. Forfeitures accrue to the United States.

  Forfeitures

of pay and allowances adjudged as part of a court-martial sentence, or occurring

 by operation of Article 58b are effective 14 days after the sentence is

adjudged or when the sentence is approved by the convening authority, whichever

is earlier.

   "Basic pay" does not include pay

for special qualifications, such as diving pay, or incentive pay such as

flying, parachuting, or duty on board a submarine.

  Forfeiture

of pay and allowances under Article 58b is not a part of the sentence, but

is an administrative result thereof.

  At general courts-martial,

if both a punitive discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the operation

of Article 58b results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances during that

period of confinement. If only confinement is adjudged, then if that confinement

 exceeds six months, the operation of Article 58b results in total forfeiture

of pay and allowances during that period of confinement. If only a punitive

discharge is adjudged, Article 58b has no effect on pay and allowances.

A death sentence results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances.

  At

a special court-martial, if a bad-conduct discharge and confinement are adjudged,

then the operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of

pay only (not allowances) during that period of confinement. If only confinement

is adjudged, and that confinement exceeds six months, then the operation

of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of pay only (not allowances)

during the period of confinement. If only a bad conduct discharge is adjudged,

Article 58b has no effect on pay.

  If the sentence, as approved

by the convening authority or other competent authority, does not result

in forfeitures by the operation of Article 58b, then only adjudged forfeitures

are effective.

   Article 58b has no effect on summary courts-martial.

#### (3) Fine.

Any court-martial may adjudge a fine in lieu of or in addition to forfeitures.  In the case of a member of the armed forces, summary and special courts-martial may not adjudge any fine or combination of fine and forfeitures in excess of the total amount of forfeitures that may be adjudged in that case.  In the case of a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, a summary court-martial may not adjudge a fine in excess of two-thirds of one month of the highest rate of enlisted pay, and a special court-martial may not adjudge a fine in excess of two-thirds of one year of the highest rate of officer pay.  To enforce collection, a fine may be accompanied by a provision in the sentence that, in the event the fine is not paid, the person fined shall, in addition to any period of confinement adjudged, be further confined until a fixed period considered an equivalent punishment to the fine has expired.  The total period of confinement so adjudged shall not exceed the jurisdictional limitations of the court-martial;

##### Discussion

A fine is in the nature of a judgment and, when ordered executed, makes the accused immediately liable to the United States for the entire amount of money specified in the sentence.  A fine normally should not be adjudged against a member of the armed forces unless the accused was unjustly enriched as a result of the offense of which convicted.  In the case of a civilian subject to military law, a fine, rather than a forfeiture, is the proper monetary penalty to be adjudged, regardless of whether unjust enrichment is present.

  _See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(3) concerning imposition of confinement when the

accused fails to pay a fine.

  Where the sentence adjudged

at a special court-martial includes a fine, see R.C.M. 1107(d)(5) for limitations

on convening authority action on the sentence.

#### (4) Reduction in pay grade.

Except as provided in R.C.M. 1301(d), a court-martial may sentence

an enlisted member to be reduced to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade;

##### Discussion

Reduction under Article 58a is not a part of the sentence but is

an administrative result thereof.

#### (5) Restriction to specified limits.

Restriction may be adjudged for no more than 2 months for each month

 of authorized confinement and in no case for more than 2 months. Confinement

and restriction may be adjudged in the same case, but they may not together

exceed the maximum authorized period of confinement, calculating the equivalency

at the rate specified in this subsection;

##### Discussion

Restriction does not exempt the person on whom it is imposed from

any military duty. Restriction and hard labor without confinement may be

adjudged in the same case provided they do not exceed the maximum limits

 for each. _See_ subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii) of this rule. The

 sentence adjudged should specify the limits of the restriction.

#### (6) Hard labor without confinement.

Hard labor without confinement may be adjudged for no more than

1-1/2 months for each month of authorized confinement and in no case for

more than three months. Hard labor without confinement may be adjudged only

 in the cases of enlisted members. The court-martial shall not specify the

hard labor to be performed. Confinement and hard labor without confinement

may be adjudged in the same case, but they may not together exceed the maximum

authorized period of confinement, calculating the equivalency at the rate

specified in this subsection.

##### Discussion

Hard labor without confinement is performed in addition to other

 regular duties and does not excuse or relieve a person from performing regular

duties. Ordinarily, the immediate commander of the accused will designate

 the amount and character of the labor to be performed. Upon completion of

the daily assignment, the accused should be permitted to take leave or liberty

to which entitled.

  _See_ R.C.M. 1301(d) concerning

limitations on hard labor without confinement in summary courts-martial.

#### (7) Confinement.

The place of confinement shall not be designated by the court-martial.

When confinement for life is authorized, it may be with or without eligibility

for parole. A court-martial shall not adjudge a sentence to solitary confinement

or to confinement without hard labor;

##### Discussion

The authority executing a sentence to confinement may require hard

 labor whether or not the words "at hard labor" are included

in the sentence. _See_ Article 58(b). To promote uniformity,

the words "at hard labor" should be omitted in a sentence to

confinement.

#### (8) Punitive separation.

A court-martial may not adjudge an administrative separation from

the service. There are three types of punitive separation.

##### (A) Dismissal.

Dismissal applies only to commissioned officers, commissioned warrant

 officers, cadets, and midshipmen and may be adjudged only by a general court-martial.

Regardless of the maximum punishment specified for an offense in Part IV

of this Manual, a dismissal may be adjudged for any offense of which a commissioned

 officer, commissioned warrant officer, cadet, or midshipman has been found

 guilty;

##### (B) Dishonorable discharge.

A dishonorable discharge applies only to enlisted persons and warrant

 officers who are not commissioned and may be adjudged only by a general

court-martial. Regardless of the maximum punishment specified for an offense

in Part IV of this Manual, a dishonorable discharge may be adjudged for any

offense of which a warrant officer who is not commissioned has been found

guilty. A dishonorable discharge should be reserved for those who should

be separated under conditions of dishonor, after having been convicted of

offenses usually recognized in civilian jurisdictions as felonies, or of

offenses of a military nature requiring severe punishment; and

###### Discussion

 _See also_ subsection (d)(1) of this rule regarding

when a dishonorable discharge is authorized as an additional punishment.

  _

See_ Article 56a.

##### (C) Bad conduct discharge.

A bad-conduct discharge applies only to enlisted persons and may

be adjudged by a general court-martial and by a special court-martial which

has met the requirements of R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B). A bad-conduct discharge

is less severe than a dishonorable discharge and is designed as a punishment

for bad-conduct rather than as a punishment for serious offenses of either

a civilian or military nature. It is also appropriate for an accused who

has been convicted repeatedly of minor offenses and whose punitive separation

 appears to be necessary;

###### Discussion

 _See also_ subsections (d)(2) and (3) of this rule

regarding when a bad-conduct discharge is authorized as an additional punishment.

#### (9) Death.

Death may be adjudged only in accordance with R.C.M. 1004; and

#### (10) Punishments under the law of war.

In cases tried under the law of war, a general court-martial may

 adjudge any punishment not prohibited by the law of war.

### (c) Limits on punishments.

#### (1) Based on offenses.

##### (A) Offenses listed in Part IV.

###### (i) Maximum punishment.

The maximum limits for the authorized punishments of confinement,

 forfeitures and punitive discharge (if any) are set forth for each offense

listed in Part IV of this Manual. These limitations are for each separate

 offense, not for each charge. When a dishonorable discharge is authorized,

a bad-conduct discharge is also authorized.

###### (ii) Other punishments.

Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Manual, the types

 of punishments listed in subsections (b)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7)

of this rule may be adjudged in addition to or instead of confinement, forfeitures,

a punitive discharge (if authorized), and death (if authorized).

##### (B) Offenses not listed Part IV.

###### (i) Included or related offenses.

For an offense not listed in Part IV of this Manual which is included

 in or closely related to an offense listed therein the maximum punishment

shall be that of the offense listed; however if an offense not listed is

included in a listed offense, and is closely related to another or is equally

closely related to two or more listed offenses, the maximum punishment shall

be the same as the least severe of the listed offenses.

###### (ii) Not included or related offenses.

An offense not listed in Part IV and not included in or closely

 related to any offense listed therein is punishable as authorized by the

United States Code, or as authorized by the custom of the service. When the

 United States Code provides for confinement for a specified period or not

more than a specified period the maximum punishment by court-martial shall

include confinement for that period. If the period is 1 year or longer, the

 maximum punishment by court-martial also includes a dishonorable discharge

and forfeiture of all pay and allowances; if 6 months or more, a bad-conduct

discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances; if less than 6 months,

 forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for the authorized period of confinement.

##### (C) Multiple Offenses.

When the accused is found guilty of two or more offenses, the maximum authorized punishment may be imposed for each separate offense, unless the military judge finds that the offenses are either multiplicious or unreasonably multiplied.

###### (i) Multiplicity.

 A charge is multiplicious and must be dismissed if the proof of such charge also proves every element of another charged offense unless Congress intended to impose multiple punishments for the same act.

###### (ii) Unreasonable Multiplication.

 If the military judge finds that there is an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence, the maximum punishment for those offenses shall be the maximum authorized punishment for the offense carrying the greatest maximum punishment. The military judge may either merge the offenses for sentencing, or dismiss one or more of the charges.

####### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12); 907(b)(3)(B).

  Even if charges are not multiplicious, a military judge may rule on a motion that the prosecutor abused his discretion under R.C.M. 307(c)(4) or a motion that an unreasonable multiplication of charges requires relief under R.C.M. 1003(b)(1). Rather than the "single impulse"  test  previously  noted  in this Discussion, "[t]he better approach is to allow the military judge, in his or her discretion, to merge the offenses for sentencing purposes..." by determining whether the Quiroz test is fulfilled.

_United States v. Campbell_, 71 M.J. 19 (C.A.A.F. 2012). (citing _United States v. Quiroz_, 55 M.J. 334, 338 (C.A.A.F. 2001).

  Multiplicity is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B). Unreasonable multiplication of charges is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12).

#### (2) Based on rank of accused.

##### (A) Commissioned or warrant officers, cadets, and midshipmen.

(i) A commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet, or midshipman may

not be reduced in grade by any court-martial. However, in time of war or

national emergency the Secretary concerned, or such Under Secretary or Assistant

Secretary as may be designated by the Secretary concerned, may commute a

sentence of dismissal to reduction to any enlisted grade.

(ii) Only a general court-martial may sentence a commissioned or warrant

 officer or a cadet, or midshipman to confinement.

(iii) A commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet or midshipman may not

be sentenced to hard labor without confinement.

(iv) Only a general court-martial, upon conviction of any offense in

 violation of the Code, may sentence a commissioned or warrant officer or

a cadet or midshipman to be separated from the service with a punitive separation.

 In the case of commissioned officers, cadets, midshipmen, and commissioned

 warrant officers, the separation shall be by dismissal. In the case of all

other warrant officers, the separation shall by dishonorable discharge.

##### (B) Enlisted persons.

 _See_ subsection (b)(9) of this rule and R.C.M.

1301(d).

#### (3) Based on reserve status in certain circumstances.

##### (A) Restriction on liberty.

A member of a reserve component whose order to active duty is approved

pursuant to Article 2(d)(5) may be required to serve any adjudged restriction

on liberty during that period of active duty. Other members of a reserve

component ordered to active duty pursuant to Article 2(d)(1) or tried by

summary court-martial while on inactive duty training may not-

(i) by sentenced to confinement; or

(ii) be required to serve a court-martial punishment consisting of any

 other restriction on liberty except during subsequent periods of inactive-duty

training or active duty.

##### (B) Forfeiture.

A sentence to forfeiture of pay of a member not retained on active

 duty after completion of disciplinary proceedings may be collected from

active duty and inactive-duty training pay during subsequent periods of duty.

###### Discussion

For application of this subsection, _see_ R.C.M.

204. At the conclusion of nonjudicial punishment proceedings or final adjournment

of the court-martial, the reserve component member who was ordered to active

duty for the purpose of conducting disciplinary proceedings should be released

from active duty within one working day unless the order to active duty was

approved by the Secretary concerned and confinement or other restriction

on liberty was adjudged. Unserved punishments may be carried over to subsequent

periods of inactive-duty training or active duty.

#### (4) Based on status as a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field.

In the case of a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, no court-martial may adjudge forfeiture of pay and allowances, reduction in pay grade, hard labor without confinement, or a punitive separation.

##### (5) Based on other rules.

The maximum limits on punishments in this rule may be further limited

 by other Rules of Courts-martial.

###### Discussion

The maximum punishment may be limited by: the jurisdictional limits

 of the court-martial (_see _ R.C.M. 201(f) and 1301(d)); the

nature of the proceedings (_see_ R.C.M. 810(d) (sentence

limitations in rehearings, new trials, and other trials)); and by instructions

 by a convening authority (_see_ R.C.M. 601(e)(1)). _

See also_ R.C.M. 1107(d)(4) concerning limits on the maximum punishment

which may be approved depending on the nature of the record.

### (d) Circumstances permitting increased punishments.

#### (1) Three or more convictions.

If an accused is found guilty of an offense or offenses for none

of which a dishonorable discharge is otherwise authorized, proof of three

or more previous convictions adjudged by a court-martial during the year

next preceding the commission of any offense of which the accused stands

convicted shall authorize a dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all

pay and allowances and, if the confinement otherwise authorized is less

than 1 year, confinement for 1 year. In computing the 1-year period preceding

the commission of any offense, periods of unauthorized absence shall be excluded.

For purposes of this subsection, the court-martial convictions must be final.

#### (2) Two or more convictions.

If an accused is found guilty of an offense or offenses for none

of which a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is otherwise authorized,

proof of two or more previous convictions adjudged by a court-martial during

the 3 years next preceding the commission of any offense of which the accused

stands convicted shall authorize a bad-conduct discharge and forfeiture of

all pay and allowances and, if the confinement otherwise authorized is less

than 3 months, confinement for 3 months. In computing the 3 year period preceding

the commission of any offense, periods of unauthorized absence shall be excluded.

 For purposes of this subsection the court-martial convictions must be final.

#### (3) Two or more offenses.

If an accused is found guilty of two or more offenses for none of

 which a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is otherwise authorized, the

fact that the authorized confinement for these offenses totals 6 months

or more shall, in addition, authorize a bad-conduct discharge and forfeiture

of all pay and allowances.

##### Discussion

All of these increased punishments are subject to all other limitations

on punishments set forth elsewhere in this rule. Convictions by summary court-martial

may not be used to increase the maximum punishment under this rule. However

they may be admitted and considered under R.C.M. 1001.

## Rule 1004. Capital cases

### (a) In general.

Death may be adjudged only when:

(1) Death is expressly authorized under Part IV of this Manual for an

 offense of which the accused has been found guilty or is authorized under

the law of war for an offense of which the accused has been found guilty

under the law of war; and

(2) The accused was convicted of such an offense by the concurrence

of all the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote was

taken; and

(3) The requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this rule have been

 met.

### (b) Procedure.

In addition to the provisions in R.C.M. 1001, the following procedures

shall apply in capital cases-

#### (1) Notice.

##### (A) Referral.

The convening authority shall indicate that the case is to be tried as a capital case by including a special instruction in the referral block of the charge sheet. Failure to include this special instruction at the time of the referral shall not bar the convening authority from later adding the required special instruction, provided:

(i) that the convening authority has otherwise complied with the notice requirement of subsection (B); and

(ii) that if the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure to include the special instruction, a continuance or a recess is an adequate remedy.

####### (B) Arraignment.

Before arraignment, trial counsel shall give the defense written

 notice of which aggravating factors under subsection (c) of this rule the

prosecution intends to prove. Failure to provide timely notice under this

 subsection of any aggravating factors under subsection (c) of this rule shall

 not bar later notice and proof of such additional aggravating factors unless

the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure and that a

continuance or a recess is not an adequate remedy.

#### (2) Evidence of aggravating factors.

Trial counsel may present evidence in accordance with R.C.M. 1001(b)(4)

tending to establish one or more of the aggravating factors in subsection

(c) of this rule.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ subsection (b)(5) of this rule.

#### (3) Evidence in extenuation and mitigation.

The accused shall be given broad latitude to present evidence in

 extenuation and mitigation.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1001(c).

#### (4) Necessary findings.

Death may not be adjudged unless-

(A) The members find that at least one of the aggravating factors under

 subsection (c) existed;

(B) Notice of such factor was provided in accordance with paragraph

(1) of this subsection and all members concur in the finding with respect

to such factor; and

(C) All members concur that any extenuating or mitigating circumstances

 are substantially outweighed by any aggravating circumstances admissible

under R.C.M. 1001(b)(4), including the factors under subsection (c) of this

rule.

#### (5) Basis for findings.

The findings in subsection (b)(4) of this rule may be based on

evidence introduced before or after findings under R.C.M. 921, or both.

#### (6) Instructions.

In addition to the instructions required under R.C.M. 1005, the

 military judge shall instruct the members of such aggravating factors under

subsection (c) of this rule as may be in issue in the case, and on the requirements

and procedures under subsections (b)(4), (5), (7), and (8) of this rule.

The military judge shall instruct the members that they must consider all

evidence in extenuation and mitigation before they may adjudge death.

#### (7) Voting.

In closed session, before voting on a sentence, the members shall

 vote by secret written ballot separately on each aggravating factor under

subsection (c) of this rule on which they have been instructed. Death may

not be adjudged unless all members concur in a finding of the existence of

 at least one such aggravating factor. After voting on all the aggravating

factors on which they have been instructed, the members shall vote on a

sentence in accordance with R.C.M. 1006.

#### (8) Announcement.

If death is adjudged, the president shall, in addition to complying

 with R.C.M. 1007, announce which aggravating factors under subsection (c)

of this rule were found by the members.

### (c) Aggravating factors.

Death may be adjudged only if the members find, beyond a reasonable

 doubt, one or more of the following aggravating factors:

(1) That the offense was committed before or in the presence of the

 enemy, except that this factor shall not apply in the case of a violation

of Article 118 or 120;

##### Discussion

 _See_ paragraph 23, Part IV, for a definition of

"before or in the presence of the enemy."

(2) That in committing the offense the accused-

(A) Knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to the national

 security of the United States; or

(B) Knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to a mission,

 system, or function of the United States, provided that this subparagraph

shall apply only if substantial damage to the national security of the United

States would have resulted had the intended damage been effected;

(3) That the offense caused substantial damage to the national security

 of the United States, whether or not the accused intended such damage, except

that this factor shall not apply in case of a violation of Article 118 or

120;

(4) That the offense was committed in such a way or under circumstances

 that the life of one or more persons other than the victim was unlawfully

and substantially endangered, except that this factor shall not apply to

a violation of Articles 104, 106a, or 120;

(5) That the accused committed the offense with the intent to avoid

 hazardous duty;

(6) That, only in the case of a violation of Article 118 or 120, the

 offense was committed in time of war and in territory in which the United

States or an ally of the United States was then an occupying power or in

which the armed forces of the United States were then engaged in active hostilities;

(7) That, only in the case of a violation of Article 118(1):

(A) The accused was serving a sentence of confinement for 30 years or

 more or for life at the time of the murder;

(B) The murder was committed: while the accused was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of any robbery, rape, rape of a child, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, sexual abuse of a child, aggravated arson, forcible sodomy, burglary, kidnapping, mutiny, sedition, or piracy of an aircraft or vessel; or while the accused was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of any offense involving the wrongful distribution, manufacture, or introduction or possession, with intent to distribute, of a controlled substance; or, while the accused was engaged in flight or attempted flight after the commission or attempted commission of any such offense.

(C) The murder was committed for the purpose of receiving money or a

 thing of value;

(D) The accused procured another by means of compulsion, coercion, or

a promise of an advantage, a service, or a thing of value to commit the

murder;

(E) The murder was committed with the intent to avoid or to prevent

 lawful apprehension or effect an escape from custody or confinement;

(F) The victim was the President of the United States, the President-elect,

the Vice President, or, if there was no Vice President, the officer in the

order of succession to the office of President of the United States, the

Vice-President-elect, or any individual who is acting as President under

the Constitution and laws of the United States, any Member of Congress (including

a Delegate to, or Resident Commissioner in, the Congress) or Member-of-Congress

elect, justice or judge of the United States, a chief of state or head of

government (or the political equivalent) of a foreign nation, or a foreign

official (as such term is defined in section 1116(b)(3)(A) of title 18,

United States Code), if the official was on official business at the time

of the offense and was in the United States or in a place described in Mil.

R. Evid.315(c)(2), 315(c)(3);

(G) The accused then knew that the victim was any of the following

persons in the execution of office: a commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned,

or petty officer of the armed services of the United States; a member of

any law enforcement or security activity or agency, military or civilian,

including correctional custody personnel; or any firefighter;

(H) The murder was committed with intent to obstruct justice;

(I) The murder was preceded by the intentional infliction of substantial

 physical harm or prolonged, substantial mental or physical pain and suffering

to the victim. For purposes of this section, "substantial physical

harm" means fractures or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members

of the body, serious damage to internal organs, or other serious bodily injuries.

The term "substantial physical harm" does not mean minor injuries,

such as a black eye or bloody nose.  The term "substantial mental

or physical pain or suffering" is accorded its common meaning and includes

torture.

(J) The accused has been found guilty in the same case of another violation

of Article 118;

(K) The victim of the murder was under 15 years of age.

(8) That only in the case of a violation of Article 118(4), the accused was the actual perpetrator of the killing or was a principal whose participation in the burglary, forcible sodomy, rape, rape of a child, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, sexual abuse of a child, robbery, or aggravated arson was major and who manifested a reckless indifference for human life.

##### Discussion

Conduct amounts to "reckless indifference" when it

evinces a wanton disregard of consequences under circumstances involving

grave danger to the life of another, although no harm is necessarily intended.

 The accused must have had actual knowledge of the grave danger to others

or knowledge of circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to realize

the highly dangerous character of such conduct. In determining whether participation

in the offense was major, the accused's presence at the scene and the extent

to which the accused aided, abetted, assisted, encouraged, or advised the

other participants should be considered. _See United States v. Berg

_, 31 M.J. 38 (C.M.A. 1990); _ United States v. McMonagle

_ 38 M.J. 53 (C.M.A. 1993).

(9) That, in addition to the offense for which the accused is eligible for the death penalty, the accused has also been convicted of a sexual offense in which:

(A) Under Article 120b, the victim was under the age of 12; or

(B) Under Articles 120 or 120b, the accused maimed or attempted to kill the victim;

(10) That, only in the case of a violation of the law of war, death is

 authorized under the law of war for the offense;

(11) That, only in the case of a violation of Article 104 or 106a:

(A) The accused has been convicted of another offense involving espionage

 or treason for which either a sentence of death or imprisonment for life

was authorized by statute; or

(B) That in committing the offense, the accused knowingly created a

grave risk of death to a person other than the individual who was the victim.

 For

purposes of this rule, "national security" means the national

defense and foreign relations of the United States and specifically includes:

a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations;

a favorable foreign relations position; or a defense posture capable of successfully

resisting hostile or destructive action from within or without.

###### Discussion

Examples of substantial damage of the national security of the United

 States include: impeding the performance of a combat mission or operation;

impeding the performance of an important mission in a hostile fire or imminent

danger pay area (_see_ 37 U.S.C. &sect; 310(a)); and disclosing

military plans, capabilities, or intelligence such as to jeopardize any combat

mission or operation of the armed services of the United States or its allies

or to materially aid an enemy of the United States.

### (d) Spying.

If the accused has been found guilty of spying under Article 106,

 subsections (a)(2), (b), and (c) of this rule and R.C.M. 1006 and 1007 shall

not apply. Sentencing proceedings in accordance with R.C.M. 1001 shall be

conducted, but the military judge shall announce that by operation of law

a sentence of death has been adjudged.

### (e) Other penalties.

Except for a violation of Article 106, when death is an authorized

 punishment for an offense, all other punishments authorized under R.C.M.

1003 are also authorized for that offense, including confinement for life,

 with or without eligibility for parole, and may be adjudged in lieu of the

 death penalty, subject to limitations specifically prescribed in this Manual.

A sentence of death includes a dishonorable discharge or dismissal as appropriate.

Confinement is a necessary incident of a sentence of death, but not a part

of it.

#### Discussion

A sentence of death may not be ordered executed until approved by

the President. _See_ R.C.M. 1207. A sentence to death which

has been finally ordered executed will be carried out in the manner prescribed

by the Secretary concerned. _See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(1).

## Rule 1005. Instructions on sentence

### (a) In general.

The military judge shall give the members appropriate instructions

on sentence.

#### Discussion

Instructions should be tailored to the facts and circumstances of

the individual case.

### (b) When given.

Instructions on sentence shall be given after arguments by counsel

 and before the members close to deliberate on sentence, but the military

judge may, upon request of the members, any party, or _sua sponte

_, give additional instructions at a later time.

### (c) Requests for instructions.

After presentation of matters relating to sentence or at such other

 time as the military judge may permit, any party may request that the military

judge instruct the members on the law as set forth in the request. The military

judge may require the requested instruction to be written. Each party shall

 be given the opportunity to be heard on any proposed instruction on sentence

 before it is given. The military judge shall inform the parties of the proposed

action on such requests before their closing arguments on sentence.

#### Discussion

Requests for and objections to instructions should be resolved at

an Article 39(a) session. _But see_ R.C.M. 801(e)(1)(C); 803.

  The

military judge is not required to give the specific instruction requested

by counsel if the matter is adequately covered in the instructions.

  The

military judge should not identify the source of any instruction when addressing

the members.

  All written requests for instructions should

be marked as appellate exhibits, whether or not they are given.

### (d) How given.

Instructions on sentence shall be given orally on the record in

the presence of all parties and the members. Written copies of the instructions,

or unless a party objects, portions of them, may also be given to the members

for their use during deliberations.

#### Discussion

A copy of any written instructions delivered to the members should

be marked as an appellate exhibit.

### (e) Required instructions.

Instructions on sentence shall include:

(1) A statement of the maximum authorized punishment that may be adjudged

 and of the mandatory minimum punishment, if any;

##### Discussion

The maximum punishment that may be adjudged is the lowest of the total permitted by the applicable paragraph(s) in Part IV for each separate offense of which the accused was convicted (_see also_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning additional limits on punishments and additional punishments which may be adjudged) or the jurisdictional limit of the court-martial (_see_ R.C.M. 201(f) and R.C.M. 1301(d)).  _See also_ Discussion to R.C.M. 810(d).  The military judge may upon request or when otherwise appropriate instruct on lesser punishments.  _See_ R.C.M. 1003.  If an additional punishment is authorized under R.C.M. 1003(d), the members must be informed of the basis for the increased punishment.

  A carefully drafted sentence worksheet ordinarily should be used and should include reference to all authorized punishments in the case.

(2) A statement of the effect any sentence announced including a punitive

 discharge and confinement, or confinement in excess of six months, will

have on the accused's entitlement to pay and allowances;

(3) A statement of the procedures for deliberation and voting on the

 sentence set out in R.C.M. 1006;

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1004 concerning additional instructions

 required in capital cases.

(4) A statement informing the members that they are solely responsible

 for selecting an appropriate sentence and may not rely on the possibility

of any mitigating action by the convening or higher authority; and

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1002.

(5) A statement that the members should consider all matters in extenuation,

mitigation, and aggravation, whether introduced before or after findings,

and matters introduced under R.C.M. 1001(b)(1), (2), (3) and (5).

##### Discussion

For example, tailored instructions on sentencing should bring attention

to the reputation or record of the accused in the service for good conduct,

efficiency, fidelity, courage, bravery, or other traits of good character,

and any pretrial restraint imposed on the accused.

### (f) Waiver.

Failure to object to an instruction or to omission of an instruction

 before the members close to deliberate on the sentence constitutes waiver

of the objection in the absence of plain error. The military judge may require

the party objecting to specify in what respect the instructions were improper.

The parties shall be given the opportunity to be heard on any objection outside

the presence of the members.

## Rule 1006. Deliberations and voting on sentence

### (a) In general.

The members shall deliberate and vote after the military judge

instructs the members on sentence. Only the members shall be present during

deliberations and voting. Superiority in rank shall not be used in any manner

to control the independence of members in the exercise of their judgment.

### (b) Deliberations.

Deliberations may properly include full and free discussion of the

 sentence to be imposed in the case. Unless otherwise directed by the military

judge, members may take with them in deliberations their notes, if any,

any exhibits admitted in evidence, and any written instructions. Members

may request that the court-martial be reopened and that portions of the record

be read to them or additional evidence introduced. The military judge may,

in the exercise of discretion, grant such requests.

### (c) Proposal of sentences.

Any member may propose a sentence. Each proposal shall be in writing

 and shall contain the complete sentence proposed. The junior member shall

collect the proposed sentences and submit them to the president.

#### Discussion

A proposal should state completely each kind and, where appropriate,

 amount of authorized punishment proposed by that member. For example, a

proposal of confinement for life would state whether it is with or without

eligibility for parole. _See_ R.C.M.1003(b).

### (d) Voting.

#### (1) Duty of members.

Each member has the duty to vote for a proper sentence for the

offenses of which the court-martial found the accused guilty, regardless

of the member's vote or opinion as to the guilt of the accused.

#### (2) Secret ballot.

 Proposed sentences shall be voted on by secret written ballot.

#### (3) Procedure.

##### (A) Order.

All members shall vote on each proposed sentence in its entirety

 beginning with the least severe and continuing, as necessary, with the next

least severe, until a sentence is adopted by the concurrence of the number

of members required under subsection (d)(4) of this rule. The process of

proposing sentences and voting on them may be repeated as necessary until

a sentence is adopted.

##### (B) Counting votes.

 The junior member shall collect the ballots and count the votes.

The president shall check the count and inform the other members of the

result.

###### Discussion

A sentence adopted by the required number of members may be reconsidered

only in accordance with R.C.M. 1009.

#### (4) Number of votes required.

##### (A) Death.

A sentence which includes death may be adjudged only if all members

 present vote for that sentence.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1004.

##### (B) Confinement for life, with or without eligibility for parole, or more

 than 10 years.

A sentence that includes confinement for life, with or without

eligibility for parole, or more than 10 years may be adjudged only if at

least three-fourths of the members present vote for that sentence.

##### (C) Other.

A sentence other than those described in subsection (d)(4)(A) or

(B) of this rule may be adjudged only if at least two-thirds of the members

present vote for that sentence.

###### Discussion

In computing the number of votes required to adopt a sentence, any

 fraction of a vote is rounded up to the next whole number. For example,

if there are seven members, at least six would have to concur to impose a

 sentence requiring a three-fourths vote, while at least five would have to

 concur to impose a sentence requiring a two-thirds vote.

#### (5) Mandatory sentence.

When a mandatory minimum is prescribed under Article 118 the members

 shall vote on a sentence in accordance with this rule.

#### (6) Effect of failure to agree.

If the required number of members do not agree on a sentence after

a reasonable effort to do so, a mistrial may be declared as to the sentence

and the case shall be returned to the convening authority, who may order

a rehearing on sentence only or order that a sentence of no punishment be

imposed.

### (e) Action after a sentence is reached.

After the members have agreed upon a sentence, the court-martial

 shall be opened and the president shall inform the military judge that a

sentence has been reached. The military judge may, in the presence of the

parties, examine any writing which the president intends to read to announce

the sentence and may assist the members in putting the sentence in proper

form. Neither that writing nor any oral or written clarification or discussion

concerning it shall constitute announcement of the sentence.

#### Discussion

Ordinarily a sentence worksheet should be provided to the members

as an aid to putting the sentence in proper form. _See_ Appendix

11 for a format for forms of sentences. If a sentence worksheet has been

provided, the military judge should examine it before the president announces

 the sentence. If the military judge intends to instruct the members after

such examination, counsel should be permitted to examine the worksheet and

to be heard on any instructions the military judge may give.

  The

president should not disclose any specific number of votes for or against

any sentence.

  If the sentence is ambiguous or apparently

illegal, _ see_ R.C.M. 1009.

## Rule 1007. Announcement of sentence

### (a) In general.

The sentence shall be announced by the president or, in a court-martial

composed of a military judge alone, by the military judge, in the presence

of all parties promptly after it has been determined.

#### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 11.

  An element

of a sentence adjudged by members about which no instructions were given

and which is not listed on a sentence worksheet is not proper.

### (b) Erroneous announcement.

If the announced sentence is not the one actually determined by

the court-martial, the error may be corrected by a new announcement made

before the record of trial is authenticated and forwarded to the convening

authority. This action shall not constitute reconsideration of the sentence.

If the court-martial has been adjourned before the error is discovered,

the military judge may call the court-martial into session to correct the

announcement.

#### Discussion

For procedures governing reconsideration of the sentence, _

 see_ R.C.M. 1009. _See also_ R.C.M. 1102 concerning

the action to be taken if the error in the announcement is discovered after

the record is authenticated and forwarded to the convening authority.

### (c) Polling prohibited.

Except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 606, members may not otherwise

be questioned about their deliberations and voting.

## Rule 1008. Impeachment of sentence

A sentence which is proper on its face may be impeached only when

 extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the attention

of a member, outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member,

or unlawful command influence was brought to bear upon any member.

### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 923 Discussion concerning impeachment

of findings.

## Rule 1009. Reconsideration of sentence

### (a) Reconsideration.

Subject to this rule, a sentence may be reconsidered at any time

 before such sentence is announced in open session of the court.

### (b) Exceptions.

(1) If the sentence announced in open session was less than the mandatory

 minimum prescribed for an offense of which the accused has been found guilty,

the court that announced the sentence may reconsider such sentence upon

reconsideration in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule.

(2) If the sentence announced in open session exceeds the maximum permissible

punishment for the offense or the jurisdictional limitation of the court-martial,

the sentence may be reconsidered after announcement in accordance with subsection

(e) of this rule.

### (c) Clarification of sentence.

A sentence may be clarified at any time prior to action of the

convening authority on the case.

#### (1) Sentence adjudged by the military judge.

When a sentence adjudged by the military judge is ambiguous, the

 military judge shall call a session for clarification as soon as practical

after the ambiguity is discovered.

#### (2) Sentence adjudged by members.

When a sentence adjudged by members is ambiguous, the military judge

 shall bring the matter to the attention of the members if the matter is

discovered before the court-martial is adjourned. If the matter is discovered

 after adjournment, the military judge may call a session for clarification

by the members who adjudged the sentence as soon as practical after the ambiguity

 is discovered.

### (d) Action by the convening authority.

When a sentence adjudged by the court-martial is ambiguous, the

 convening authority may return the matter to the court-martial for clarification.

 When a sentence adjudged by the court-martial is apparently illegal, the

convening authority may return the matter to the court-martial for reconsideration

or may approve a sentence no more severe than the legal, unambiguous portions

of the adjudged sentence.

### (e) Reconsideration procedure.

Any member of the court-martial may propose that a sentence reached

 by the members be reconsidered.

#### (1) Instructions.

When a sentence has been reached by members and reconsideration

has been initiated, the military judge shall instruct the members on the

procedure for reconsideration.

#### (2) Voting.

The members shall vote by secret written ballot in closed session

 whether to reconsider a sentence already reached by them.

#### (3) Number of votes required.

##### (A) With a view to increasing.

Subject to subsection (b) of this rule, members may reconsider a

 sentence with a view of increasing it only if at least a majority vote for

reconsideration.

##### (B) With a view to decreasing.

Members may reconsider a sentence with a view to decreasing it only

 if:

(i) In the case of a sentence which includes death, at least one member

 votes to reconsider;

(ii) In the case of a sentence which includes confinement for life, with

 or without eligibility for parole, or more than 10 years, more than one-fourth

of the members vote to reconsider; or;

(iii) In the case of any other sentence, more than one-third of the members

 vote to reconsider.

####### Discussion

After a sentence has been adopted by secret ballot vote in closed

 session, no other vote may be taken on the sentence unless a vote to reconsider

succeeds.

  For example, if six of nine (two-thirds) members

adopt a sentence, a vote of at least five would be necessary to reconsider

to increase it; four would have to vote to reconsider in order to decrease

it. If seven of nine (three-fourths) members is required to adopt a sentence,

a vote of at least five would be necessary to reconsider to increase it,

while three would be necessary to reconsider to decrease it.

#### (4) Successful vote.

If a vote to reconsider a sentence succeeds, the procedures in R.C.M.

 1006 shall apply.

## Rule 1010. Notice concerning post-trial and appellate rights

In each general and special court-martial, prior to adjournment,

the military judge shall ensure that the defense counsel has informed the

accused orally and in writing of:

(a) The right to submit matters to the convening authority to consider

 before taking action;

(b) The right to appellate review, as applicable, and the effect of

 waiver or withdrawal of such right;

(c) The right to apply for relief from the Judge Advocate General if

the case is neither reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals nor reviewed

by the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1); and

(d) The right to the advice and assistance of counsel in the exercise

of the foregoing rights or any decision to waive them.

 The written

advice to the accused concerning post-trial and appellate rights shall be

signed by the accused and the defense counsel and inserted in the record

of trial as an appellate exhibit.

#### Discussion

The post-trial duties of the defense counsel concerning the appellate

 rights of the accused are set forth in paragraph (E)(iv) of the Discussion

accompanying R.C.M. 502(d)(6). The defense counsel shall explain the appellate

rights to the accused and prepare the written document of such advisement

prior to or during trial.

## Rule 1011. Adjournment

The military judge may adjourn the court-martial at the end of the

 trial of an accused or proceed to trial of other cases referred to that

court-martial. Such an adjournment may be for a definite or indefinite period.

### Discussion

A court-martial and its personnel have certain powers and responsibilities

following the trial. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 502(d)(5) Discussion

(F); 502(d)(6) Discussion (E); 808; 1007; 1009; Chapter XI.

# CHAPTER XI. POST-TRIAL PROCEDURE

## Rule 1101. Report of result of trial; post-trial restraint; deferment of confinement,

 forfeitures and reduction in grade; waiver of Article 58b forfeitures

### (a) Report of the result of trial.

After final adjournment of the court-martial in a case, the trial

 counsel shall promptly notify the accused's immediate commander, the convening

authority or the convening authority's designee, and, if appropriate, the

officer in charge of the confinement facility of the findings and sentence.

### (b) Post-trial confinement.

#### (1) In general.

An accused may be placed in post-trial confinement if the sentence

 adjudged by the court-martial includes death or confinement.

#### (2) Who may order confinement.

Unless limited by superior authority, a commander of the accused

may order the accused into post-trial confinement when post-trial confinement

is authorized under subsection (b)(1) of this rule. A commander authorized

 to order post-trial confinement under this subsection may delegate this

authority to the trial counsel.

##### Discussion

The commander may release the accused, order confinement, or order

 other appropriate restraint. Regardless whether the accused is ordered into

confinement, a sentence to confinement begins to run on the date it is adjudged

unless it is deferred under subsection (c) of this rule. _See_ Article

57.

#### (3) Confinement on other grounds.

Nothing in this rule shall prohibit confinement of a person after

a court-martial on proper grounds other than the offenses for which the

accused was tried at the court-martial.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 304, 305, and paragraph 5b(2), Part

V, for other grounds for confinement.

### (c) Deferment of confinement, forfeitures or reduction in grade.

#### (1) In general.

Deferment of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction

in grade is a postponement of the running of the sentence.

##### Discussion

Deferment is not suspension of the sentence or a form of clemency.

#### (2) Who may defer.

The convening authority or, if the accused is no longer in the

convening authority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is assigned, may, upon

written application of the accused, at any time after the adjournment of

the court-martial, defer the accused's service of a sentence to confinement,

forfeitures, or reduction in grade that has not been ordered executed.

#### (3) Action on deferment request.

The authority acting on the deferment request may, in that authority's

discretion, defer service of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction

in grade. The accused shall have the burden of showing that the interests

of the accused and the community in deferral outweigh the community's interests

in imposition of the punishment on its effective date. Factors that the authority

acting on a deferment request may consider in determining whether to grant

the deferment request include, where applicable: the probability of the

 accused's flight; the probability of the accused's commission of other offenses,

intimidation of witnesses, or interference with the administration of justice;

the nature of the offenses (including the effect on the victim) of which

the accused was convicted; the sentence adjudged; the command's immediate

need for the accused; the effect of deferment on good order and discipline

in the command; the accused's character, mental condition, family situation,

and service record. The decision of the authority acting on the deferment

 request shall be subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion.

The action of the authority acting on the deferment request shall be in

writing and a copy shall be provided to the accused.

##### Discussion

The deferment request and the action on the request must be attached

 to the record of trial. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(D). If the

request for deferment is denied, the basis for the denial should be in writing

and attached to the record of trial.

#### (4) Orders.

The action granting deferment shall be reported in the convening

 authority's action under R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E) and shall include the date

of the action on the request when it occurs prior to or concurrently with

the action. Action granting deferment after the convening authority's action

under R.C.M. 1107 shall be reported in orders under R.C.M. 1114 and included

in the record of trial.

#### (5) Restraint when deferment is granted.

When deferment of confinement is granted, no form of restraint or

 other limitation on the accused's liberty may be ordered as a substitute

form of punishment. An accused may, however, be restricted to specified

limits or conditions may be placed on the accused's liberty during the period

 of deferment for any other proper reason, including a ground for restraint

under R.C.M. 304.

#### (6) End of deferment.

Deferment of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction

in grade ends when:

(A) The convening authority takes action under R.C.M. 1107, unless the

 convening authority specifies in the action that service of confinement

after the action is deferred;

(B) The confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade are suspended;

(C) The deferment expires by its own terms; or

(D) The deferment is otherwise rescinded in accordance with subsection

 (c)(7) of this rule. Deferment of confinement may not continue after the

conviction is final under R.C.M. 1209.

###### Discussion

When the sentence is ordered executed, forfeitures or reduction

in grade may be suspended, but may not be deferred; deferral of confinement

may continue after action in accordance with R.C.M. 1107.  A form of punishment

cannot be both deferred and suspended at the same time.  When deferment of

confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade ends, the sentence to confinement,

 forfeitures, or reduction in grade begins to run or resumes running, as

appropriate. When the convening authority has specified in the action that

confinement will be deferred after the action, the deferment may not be terminated,

except under subsections (6)(B), (C), or (D), until the conviction is final

under R.C.M. 1209.

  See R.C.M. 1203 for deferment of a sentence

to confinement pending review under Article 67(a)(2).

#### (7) Rescission of deferment.

##### (A) Who may rescind.

The authority who granted the deferment or, if the accused is no

 longer within that authority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising general

court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is assigned,

may rescind the deferment.

##### (B) Action.

Deferment of confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade may

be rescinded when additional information is presented to a proper authority

which, when considered with all other information in the case, that authority

finds, in that authority's discretion, is grounds for denial of deferment

under subsection (c)(3) of this rule. The accused shall promptly be informed

of the basis for the rescission and of the right to submit written matters

in the accused's behalf and to request that the rescission be reconsidered.

 However, the accused may be required to serve the sentence to confinement,

 forfeitures, or reduction in grade pending this action.

##### (C) Execution.

When deferment of confinement is rescinded after the convening

authority's action under R.C.M. 1107, the confinement may be ordered executed.

However, no such order to rescind a deferment of confinement may be issued

within 7 days of notice of the rescission of a deferment of confinement to

the accused under subsection (c)(7)(B) of this rule, to afford the accused

an opportunity to respond. The authority rescinding the deferment may extend

this period for good cause shown. The accused shall be credited with any

confinement actually served during this period.

##### (D) Orders.

Rescission of a deferment before or concurrently with the initial

 action in the case shall be reported in the action under R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E),

which action shall include the dates of the granting of the deferment and

the rescission. Rescission of a deferment of confinement after the convening

authority's action shall be reported in supplementary orders in accordance

with R.C.M. 1114 and shall state whether the approved period of confinement

 is to be executed or whether all or part of it is to be suspended.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 16 for forms.

### (d) Waiving forfeitures resulting from a sentence to confinement to provide

 for dependent support.

(1) With respect to forfeiture of pay and allowances resulting only

by operation of law and not adjudged by the court, the convening authority

may waive, for a period not to exceed six months, all or part of the forfeitures

for the purpose of providing support to the accused's dependent(s). The

convening authority may waive and direct payment of any such forfeitures

when they become effective by operation of Article 57(a).

(2) Factors that may be considered by the convening authority in determining

the amount of forfeitures, if any, to be waived include, but are not limited

to, the length of the accused's confinement, the number and age(s) of the

accused's family members, whether the accused requested waiver, any debts

owed by the accused, the ability of the accused's family members to find

employment, and the availability of transitional compensation for abused

dependents permitted under 10 U.S.C. 1059.

(3) For the purposes of this Rule, a "dependent" means any

 person qualifying as a "dependent" under 37 U.S.C. 401.

##### Discussion

Forfeitures resulting by operation of law, rather than those adjudged

 as part of a sentence, may be waived for six months or for the duration

of the period of confinement, whichever is less. The waived forfeitures

are paid as support to dependent(s) designated by the convening authority.

 When directing waiver and payment, the convening authority should identify

by name the dependent(s) to whom the payments will be made and state the

number of months for which the waiver and payment shall apply. In cases

where the amount to be waived and paid is less than the jurisdictional limit

of the court, the monthly dollar amount of the waiver and payment should

be stated.

## Rule 1102. Post-trial sessions

### (a) In general.

Post-trial sessions may be proceedings in revision or Article 39(a)

 sessions. Such sessions may be directed by the military judge or the convening

authority in accordance with this rule.

### (b) Purpose.

#### (1) Proceedings in revision.

Proceedings in revision may be directed to correct an apparent error,

 omission, or improper or inconsistent action by the court-martial, which

can be rectified by reopening the proceedings without material prejudice

to the accused.

##### Discussion

Because the action at a proceeding in revision is corrective, a

 proceeding in revision may not be conducted for the purpose of presenting

additional evidence.

  Examples when a proceeding in revision

is appropriate include: correction of an ambiguous or apparently illegal

action by the court-martial; inquiry into the terms of a pretrial agreement;

and inquiry to establish the accused's awareness of certain rights.

  _

See also_ R.C.M. 1104(d) concerning correction of the record by certificate

 of correction.

#### (2) Article 39(a) sessions.

An Article 39(a) session under this rule may be called, upon motion of either party or _sua sponte_ by the military judge, for the purpose of inquiring into, and, when appropriate, resolving any matter that arises after trial and that substantially affects the legal sufficiency of any findings of guilty or the sentence.  The military judge may also call an Article 39(a) session, upon motion of either party or sua sponte, to reconsider any trial ruling that substantially affects the legal sufficiency of any findings of guilty or the sentence. The military judge may, _sua sponte_, at any time prior to authentication of the record of trial, enter a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses charged, or may enter a finding of not guilty of a part of a specification as long as a lesser offense charged is alleged in the remaining portion of the specification.  Prior to entering such a finding or findings, the military judge shall give each party an opportunity to be heard on the matter in a post-trial Article 39(a) session.

##### Discussion

For example, an Article 39(a) session may be called to permit a

 military judge to reconsider a trial ruling, or to examine allegations of

misconduct by a counsel, a member, or a witness. _See_ R.C.M. 917(d) for

the standard to be used to determine the legal sufficiency of evidence.

### (c) Matters not subject to post-trial sessions.

Post-trial session may not be directed:

(1) For reconsideration of a finding of not guilty of any specification,

 or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not guilty;

(2) For reconsideration of a finding of not guilty of any charge, unless

 the record shows a finding of guilty under a specification laid under that

charge, which sufficiently alleges a violation of some article of the code;

or

(3) For increasing the severity of the sentence unless the sentence

 prescribed for the offense is mandatory.

### (d) When directed.

The military judge may direct a post-trial session any time before

 the record is authenticated. The convening authority may direct a post-trial

session any time before the convening authority takes initial action on

the case or at such later time as the convening authority is authorized to

do so by a reviewing authority.

### (e) Procedure.

#### (1) Personnel.

The requirements of R.C.M. 505 and 805 shall apply at post-trial

 sessions except that-

(A) For a proceeding in revision, if trial was before members and the

 matter subject to the proceeding in revision requires the presence of members:

(i) The absence of any members does not invalidate the proceedings if,

in the case of a general court-martial, at least five members are present,

or, in the case of a special court-martial, at least three members are present;

and

(ii) A different military judge may be detailed, subject to R.C.M. 502(c)

 and 902, if the military judge who presided at the earlier proceedings is

not reasonably available.

(B) For an Article 39(a) session, a different military judge may be

 detailed, subject to R.C.M. 502(c) and 902, for good cause.

#### (2) Action.

The military judge shall take such action as may be appropriate,

 including appropriate instructions when members are present. The members

may deliberate in closed session, if necessary, to determine what corrective

action, if any, to take. Prior to the military judge _sua sponte_ entering a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses charged or entering a finding of not guilty of a part of a specification as long as a lesser offense charged is alleged in the remaining portion of the specification, the military judge shall give each party an opportunity to be heard on the matter.

#### (3) Record.

All post-trial sessions, except any deliberations by the members,

 shall be held in open session. The record of the post-trial sessions shall

be prepared, authenticated, and served in accordance with R.C.M. 1103 and

1104 and shall be included in the record of the prior proceedings.

## Rule 1102A. Post-trial hearing for person found not guilty only by reason of lack

of mental responsibility

### (a) In general.

The military judge shall conduct a hearing not later than forty

days following the finding that an accused is not guilty only by reason

of a lack of mental responsibility.

### (b) Psychiatric or psychological examination and report.

Prior to the hearing, the military judge or convening authority

shall order a psychiatric or psychological examination of the accused, with

the resulting psychiatric or psychological report transmitted to the military

 judge for use in the post-trial hearing.

### (c) Post-trial hearing.

(1) The accused shall be represented by defense counsel and shall have

 the opportunity to testify, present evidence, call witnesses on his or her

behalf, and to confront and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.

(2) The military judge is not bound by the rules of evidence except

with respect to privileges.

(3) An accused found not guilty only by reason of a lack of mental

responsibility of an offense involving bodily injury to another, or serious

damage to the property of another, or involving a substantial risk of such

injury or damage, has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence

that his or her release would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury

to another person or serious damage to property of another due to a present

mental disease or defect. With respect to any other offense, the accused

has the burden of such proof by a preponderance of the evidence.

(4) If, after the hearing, the military judge finds the accused has

 satisfied the standard specified in subsection (3) of this section, the

military judge shall inform the general court-martial convening authority

 of this result and the accused shall be released. If, however, the military

 judge finds after the hearing that the accused has not satisfied the standard

specified in subsection (3) of this section, then the military judge shall

inform the general court-martial convening authority of this result and that

authority may commit the accused to the custody of the Attorney General.

## Rule 1103. Preparation of record of trial

### (a) In general.

Each general, special, and summary court-martial shall keep a separate

record of the proceedings in each case brought before it.

### (b) General courts-martial.

#### (1) Responsibility for preparation.

 The trial counsel shall:

(A) Under the direction of the military judge, cause the record of trial

 to be prepared; and

(B) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, cause to

be retained stenographic or other notes or mechanical or electronic recordings

from which the record of trial was prepared.

#### (2) Contents.

##### (A) In general.

 The record of trial in each general court-martial shall be separate,

 complete, and independent of any other document.

##### (B) Verbatim transcript required.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) of this rule, the record of trial shall include a verbatim transcript of all sessions except sessions closed for deliberations and voting when:

(i) Any part of the sentence adjudged exceeds six months confinement,

 forfeiture of pay greater than two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture

of pay for more than six months or other punishments that may be adjudged

by a special court-martial; or

(ii) A bad-conduct discharge has been adjudged.

####### Discussion

A verbatim transcript includes: all proceedings including sidebar

 conferences, arguments of counsel, and rulings and instructions by the military

judge; matter which the military judge orders stricken from the record or

disregarded; and when a record is amended in revision proceedings (_

see_ R.C.M. 1102), the part of the original record changed and the

changes made, without physical alteration of the original record. Conferences

under R.C.M. 802 need not be recorded, but matters agreed upon at such conferences

must be included in the record. If testimony is given through an interpreter,

a verbatim transcript must so reflect.

##### (C) Verbatim transcript not required.

If a verbatim transcript is not required under subsection (b)(2)(B)

 of this rule, a summarized report of the proceedings may be prepared instead

of a verbatim transcript.

###### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 910(i) concerning guilty plea

inquiries.

##### (D) Other matters.

In addition to the matter required under subsection (b)(2)(B) or

 (b)(2)(C) of this rule, a complete record shall include:

(i) The original charge sheet or a duplicate;

(ii) A copy of the convening order and any amending order(s);

(iii) The request, if any, for trial by military judge alone, or that

the membership of the court-martial include enlisted persons, and, when applicable,

any statement by the convening authority required under R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B)(ii)

or 503(a)(2);

(iv) The original dated, signed action by the convening authority; and

(v) Exhibits, or, with the permission of the military judge, copies,

 photographs, or descriptions of any exhibits which were received in evidence

 and any appellate exhibits.

#### (3) Matters attached to the record.

The following matters shall be attached to the record:

(A) If not used as exhibits-

(i) The report of preliminary hearing under Article 32, if any;

(ii) The staff judge advocate's pretrial advice under Article 34, if

any;

(iii) If the trial was a rehearing or new or other trial of the case,

the record of the former hearing(s); and

(iv) Written special findings, if any, by the military judge.

(B) Exhibits or, with the permission of the military judge, copies,

 photographs, or descriptions of any exhibits which were marked for and referred

to on the record but not received in evidence;

(C) Any matter filed by the accused under R.C.M. 1105, or any written

 waiver of the right to submit such matter;

(D) Any deferment request and the action on it;

(E) Explanation for any substitute authentication under R.C.M. 1104(a)(2)(B);

(F) Explanation for any failure to serve the record of trial on the

 accused under R.C.M. 1104(b);

(G) The post-trial recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal

 officer and proof of service on defense counsel in accordance with R.C.M.

 1106(f)(1);

(H) Any response by defense counsel to the post-trial review;

(I) Recommendations and other papers relative to clemency;

(J) Any statement why it is impracticable for the convening authority

to act;

(K) Conditions of suspension, if any, and proof of service on probationer

 under R.C.M. 1108;

(L) Any waiver or withdrawal of appellate review under R.C.M. 1110;

and

(M) Records of any proceedings in connection with vacation of suspension

 under R.C.M. 1109.

(N) Documents pertaining to the receipt of the record of trial by the victim pursuant to subsection (g)(3) of this rule.

###### Discussion

Per R.C.M. 1114(f), consult service regulations for distribution of promulgating orders.

### (c) Special courts-martial.

#### (1) Involving a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months,

or forfeiture of pay for more than six months.

The requirements of subsections (b)(1), (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), (b)(2)(D),

and (b)(3) of this rule shall apply in a special court-martial in which a

bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture

of pay for more than six months, has been adjudged.

#### (2)  All other special courts-martial.

If the special court-martial resulted in findings of guilty but

a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture

of pay for more than six months, was not adjudged, the requirements of subsections

(b)(1), (b)(2)(D), and (b)(3)(A)-(F) and (I)-(M) of this rule shall apply.

### (d) Summary courts-martial.

The summary court-martial record of trial shall be prepared as

prescribed in R.C.M. 1305.

### (e) Acquittal; courts-martial resulting in findings of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility; termination prior to findings; termination after findings.

Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this rule, if proceedings resulted in an acquittal of all charges and specifications or in a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility of all charges and specifications, or if the proceedings were terminated by withdrawal, mistrial, or dismissal before findings, or if the proceedings were terminated after findings by approval of an administrative discharge in lieu of court-martial, the record may consist of the original charge sheet, a copy of the convening order and amending orders (if any), and sufficient information to establish jurisdiction over the accused and the offenses (if not shown on the charge sheet).  The convening authority or higher authority may prescribe additional requirements.

#### Discussion

The notes or recordings of court-martial proceedings described in

 this subsection should be retained if reinstitution and re-referral of the

affected charges is likely or when they may be necessary for the trial of

another accused in a related case. _See_ R.C.M. 905(g) and

914.

### (f) Loss of notes or recordings of the proceedings.

If, because of loss of recordings or notes, or other reasons, a

 verbatim transcript cannot be prepared when required by subsection (b)(2)(B)

or (c)(1) of this rule, a record which meets the requirements of subsection

(b)(2)(C) of this rule shall be prepared, and the convening authority may:

(1) Approve only so much of the sentence that could be adjudged by a

 special court-martial, except that a bad-conduct discharge, confinement

for more than six months, or forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for

more than six months, may not be approved; or

(2) Direct a rehearing as to any offense of which the accused was found

guilty if the finding is supported by the summary of the evidence contained

in the record, provided that the convening authority may not approve any sentence

imposed at such a rehearing more severe than or in excess of that adjudged

by the earlier court-martial.

### (g) Copies of the record of trial.

#### (1)  General and special courts-martial.

##### (A) In general.

In general and special courts-martial that require a verbatim transcript under subsections (b) or (c) of this rule and are subject to a review by a Court of Criminal Appeals under Article 66, the trial counsel shall cause to be prepared an original record of trial.

###### Discussion

An original record of trial includes any record of the proceedings recorded in a form that satisfies the definition of a "writing" in R.C.M. 103.  Any requirement to prepare a printed record of trial pursuant to this rule, either in lieu of or in addition to a record of trial recorded or compiled in some other format, including electronic or digital formats, is subject to service regulation.

##### (B) Additional copies.

The convening or higher authority may direct that additional copies

 of the record of trial of any general or special court-martial be prepared.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

Copies of the summary court-martial record of trial shall be prepared

 as prescribed in R.C.M. 1305(b).

#### (3) Cases involving sexual offenses.

##### (A) "Victim" defined.

  For the purposes of this rule, a victim is a person who suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of matters set forth in a charge or specification; and is named in a specification under Article 120, Article 120b, Article 120c, Article 125, or any attempt to commit such offense in violation of Article 80.

##### (B) Scope; qualifying victim.

 In a general or special court-martial, a copy of the record of trial shall be given free of charge to a victim as defined in subparagraph (A) for a specification identified in subparagraph (A) that resulted in any finding under R.C.M. 918 (a)(1). If a victim is a minor, a copy of the record of trial shall instead be provided to the parent or legal guardian of the victim.

###### Discussion

This rule is not intended to limit the Services' discretion to provide records of trial to other individuals.

##### (C) Notice.

 In accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned, and no later than authentication of the record, trial counsel shall cause each qualifying victim to be notified of the opportunity to receive a copy of the record of trial. Qualifying victims may decline receipt of such documents in writing and any written declination shall be attached to the original record of trial.

##### (D) Documents to be provided.

 For purposes of this subsection, the record of trial shall consist of documents described in subsection (b)(2) of this rule, except for proceedings described in subsection (e) of this rule, in which case the record of trial shall consist of items described in subsection (e). Matters attached to the record as described in subsection (b)(3) of this rule are not required to be provided.

###### Discussion

Subsections (b)(3)(N) and (g)(3) of this rule were added to implement Article 54(e), UCMJ, in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81, &sect; 586). Service of a copy of the record of trial on a victim is prescribed in R.C.M. 1104 (b)(1)(E).

### (h) Security classification.

If the record of trial contains matter which must be classified

under applicable security regulations, the trial counsel shall cause a proper

security classification to be assigned to the record of trial and on each

page thereof on which classified material appears.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1104(b)(1)(D) concerning the disposition

of records of trial requiring security protection.

### (i) Examination and correction before authentication.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

##### (A) Examination and correction by trial counsel.

In general and special courts-martial, the trial counsel shall

examine the record of trial before authentication and cause those changes

to be made which are necessary to report the proceedings accurately. The

trial counsel shall not change the record after authentication.

###### Discussion

The trial counsel may personally correct and initial the necessary

 changes or, if major changes are necessary, direct the reporter to rewrite

the entire record or the portion of the record which is defective.

  The

trial counsel must ensure that the reporter makes a true, complete, and accurate

record of the proceedings such that the record will meet the applicable requirements

 of this rule.

##### (B) Examination by defense counsel.

Except when unreasonable delay will result, the trial counsel shall

 permit the defense counsel to examine the record before authentication.

###### Discussion

If the defense counsel discovers errors or omissions in the record,

 the defense counsel may suggest to the trial counsel appropriate changes

to make the record accurate, forward for attachment to the record under

Article 38(c) any objections to the record, or bring any suggestions for

correction of the record to the attention of the person who authenticates

the record.

  The defense counsel should be granted reasonable

access to the reporter's notes and tapes to facilitate the examination of

the record.

  A suitable notation that the defense counsel

has examined the record should be made on the authentication page. _

See_ Appendix 13 or 14 for sample forms.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

The summary court-martial shall examine and correct the summary

 court-martial record of trial as prescribed in R.C.M. 1305(a).

### (j) Videotape and similar records.

#### (1) Recording proceedings.

If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, general

and special courts-martial may be recorded by videotape, audiotape, or similar

material from which sound and visual images may be reproduced to accurately

depict the entire court-martial. Such means of recording may be used in lieu

of recording by a qualified court reporter, when one is required, subject

to this rule.

#### (2) Preparation of written record.

When the court-martial, or any part of it, is recorded by videotape, audiotape, or similar material under subsection (j)(1) of this rule, a transcript or summary in writing (as defined in R.C.M. 103), as required in subsection (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), (b)(2)(C), or (c) of this rule, as appropriate, shall be prepared in accordance with this rule and R.C.M. 1104 before the record is forwarded under R.C.M. 1104(e), unless military exigencies prevent transcription.

#### (3) Military exigency.

If military exigency prevents preparation of a written transcript

or summary, as required, and when the court-martial has been recorded by

videotape, audiotape, or similar material under subsection (j)(1) of this

rule, the videotape, audiotape, or similar material, together with the matters

in subsections (b)(2)(D) and (b)(3) of this rule shall be authenticated and

forwarded in accordance with R.C.M. 1104, provided that in such case the

convening authority shall cause to be attached to the record a statement

of the reasons why a written record could not be prepared, and provided further

that in such case the defense counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity

to listen to or to view and listen to the recording whenever defense counsel

 is otherwise entitled to examine the record under these rules. Subsection

(g) of this rule shall not apply in case of military exigency under this

subsection.

#### (4) Further review.

##### (A) Cases reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeals.

Before review, if any, by a Court of Criminal Appeals of a case

in which the record includes an authenticated recording prepared under subsection

(j)(3) of this rule, a complete written transcript shall be prepared and

certified as accurate in accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

The authenticated recording shall be retained for examination by appellate

authorities.

##### (B) Cases not reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeals.

In cases in which the record includes an authenticated recording

 prepared under subsection (j)(3) of this rule, a written record shall be

prepared under such circumstances as the Secretary concerned may prescribe.

#### (5) Accused's copy.

When a record includes an authenticated recording under subsection

 (j)(3) of this rule, the Government shall, in order to comply with R.C.M.

1104(b):

(A) Provide the accused with a duplicate copy of the videotape, audiotape,

or similar matter and copies of any written contents of and attachments to

the record, and give the accused reasonable opportunity to use such viewing

equipment as is necessary to listen to or view and listen to the recording;

or

(B) With the written consent of the accused, defer service of the record

 until a written record is prepared under subsection (4) of this rule.

## Rule 1103A. Sealed exhibits and proceedings.

### (a) In general.

If the report of preliminary hearing or record of trial contains exhibits, proceedings, or other matter ordered sealed by the preliminary hearing officer or military judge, counsel for the government or trial counsel shall cause such materials to be sealed so as to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure. Counsel for the government or trial counsel shall ensure that such materials are properly marked, including an annotation that the material was sealed by order of the preliminary hearing officer or military judge, and inserted at the appropriate place in the original record of trial. Copies of the report of preliminary hearing or record of trial shall contain appropriate annotations that matters were sealed by order of the preliminary hearing officer or military judge and have been inserted in the report of preliminary hearing or original record of trial.

#### (b) Examination of sealed exhibits and proceedings.

Except as provided in the following subsections to this rule, sealed exhibits may not be examined.

##### (1) Prior to referral.

The following individuals may examine sealed materials only if necessary for proper fulfillment of their responsibilities under the UCMJ, the MCM, governing directives, instructions, regulations, applicable rules for practice and procedure, or rules of professional responsibility: the judge advocate advising the convening authority who directed the Article 32 preliminary hearing; the convening authority who directed the Article 32 preliminary hearing; the staff judge advocate to the general court-martial convening authority; and the general court-martial convening authority.

###### (2) Prior to authentication.

 Prior to authentication of the record by the military judge, sealed materials may not be examined in the absence of an order from the military judge based on good cause shown.

####### (3) Authentication through action.

After authentication and prior to disposition of the record of trial pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial 1111, sealed materials may not be examined in the absence of an order from the military judge upon a showing of good cause at a post-trial Article 39a session directed by the Convening Authority.

######## Discussion

 A convening authority who has granted clemency based upon review of sealed materials in the record of trial is not permitted to disclose the contents of the sealed materials when providing a written explanation of the reason for such action, as directed under R.C.M. 1107.

######## (4) Reviewing and appellate authorities.

(A) Reviewing and appellate authorities may examine sealed matters when those authorities determine that such action is reasonably necessary to a proper fulfillment of their responsibilities under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Manual for Courts-Martial, governing directives, instructions, regulations, applicable rules for practice and procedure, or rules of professional responsibility.

(B) Reviewing and appellate authorities shall not, however, disclose sealed matter or information in the absence of:

(i) Prior authorization of the Judge Advocate General in the case of review under Rule for Courts-Martial 1201(b); or

(ii) Prior authorization of the appellate court before which a case is pending review under Rules for Courts-Martial 1203 and 1204.

(C) In those cases in which review is sought or pending before the United States Supreme Court, authorization to disclose sealed materials or information shall be obtained under that Court's rules of practice and procedure.

(D) The authorizing officials in paragraph (B)(ii) above may place conditions on authorized disclosures in order to minimize the disclosure.

(E) For purposes of this rule, reviewing and appellate authorities are limited to:

(i) Judge advocates reviewing records pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial 1112;

(ii) Officers and attorneys in the office of the Judge Advocate General reviewing records pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial 1201(b);

(iii) Appellate government counsel;

(iv) Appellate defense counsel;

(v) Appellate judges of the Courts of Criminal Appeals and their professional staffs;

(vi) The judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and their professional staffs;

(vii) The Justices of the United States Supreme Court and their professional staffs; and

(viii) Any other court of competent jurisdiction.

######## (5) Examination of sealed matters.

For the purpose of this rule, "examination" includes reading, viewing, photocopying, photographing, disclosing, or manipulating the sealed matters in any way.

## Rule 1104. Records of trial: Authentication; service; loss; correction; forwarding

### (a) Authentication.

#### (1) In general.

A record is authenticated by the signature of a person specified in this rule who thereby declares that the record accurately reports the proceedings.  An electronic record of trial may be authenticated with the electronic signature of the military judge or other authorized person.  Service of an authenticated electronic copy of the record of trial with a means to review the record of trial satisfies the requirement of service under R.C.M. 1105(c) and 1305(d).  No person may be required to authenticate a record of trial if that person is not satisfied that it accurately reports the proceedings.

#### (2) General and special courts-martial.

##### (A) Authentication by the military judge.

In special courts-martial in which a bad-conduct discharge, confinement

for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months,

has been adjudged and in general courts-martial, except as provided in subsection

(a)(2)(B) of this rule, the military judge present at the end of the proceedings

shall authenticate the record of trial, or that portion over which the military

 judge presided. If more than one military judge presided over the proceedings,

each military judge shall authenticate the record of the proceedings over

which that military judge presided, except as provided in subsection (a)(2)(B)

of this rule. The record of trial of special courts-martial in which a bad-conduct

 discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for

more than six months, was not adjudged shall be authenticated in accordance

 with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

##### (B) Substitute authentication.

If the military judge cannot authenticate the record of trial because

 of the military judge's death, disability, or absence, the trial counsel

present at the end of the proceedings shall authenticate the record of trial.

If the trial counsel cannot authenticate the record of trial because of the

trial counsel's death, disability, or absence, a member shall authenticate

the record of trial. In a court-martial composed of a military judge alone,

or as to sessions without members, the court reporter shall authenticate

the record of trial when this duty would fall upon a member under this subsection.

A person authorized to authenticate a record under this subsection may authenticate

the record only as to those proceedings at which that person was present.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 13 or 14 for sample forms.

  Substitute

authentication is authorized only in emergencies. A brief, temporary absence

of the military judge from the situs of the preparation of the record of

trial does not justify a substitute authentication. Prolonged absence, including

permanent change of station, ordinarily justifies substitute authentication.

  The

person who authenticates the record of trial instead of the military judge

should attach to the record of trial an explanation for the substitute authentication.

 _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3) (E).

#### (3) Summary courts-martial.

The summary court-martial shall authenticate the summary court-martial

record of trial as prescribed in R.C.M. 1305(a).

### (b) Service.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

##### (A) Service of record of trial on accused.

In each general and special court-martial, except as provided in

 subsection (b)(1)(C) or (D) of this rule, the trial counsel shall cause

a copy of the record of trial to be served on the accused as soon as the

record of trial is authenticated.

##### (B) Proof of service of record of trial on accused.

The trial counsel shall cause the accused's receipt for the copy

of the record of trial to be attached to the original record of trial. If

it is impracticable to secure a receipt from the accused before the original

 record of trial is forwarded to the convening authority, the trial counsel

 shall prepare a certificate indicating that a copy of the record of trial

has been transmitted to the accused, including the means of transmission

 and the address, and cause the certificate to be attached to the original

 record of trial. In such a case the accused's receipt shall be forwarded

to the convening authority as soon as it is obtained.

##### (C) Substitute service.

If it is impracticable to serve the record of trial on the accused

 because of the transfer of the accused to a distant place, the unauthorized

absence of the accused, or military exigency, or if the accused so requests

on the record at the court-martial or in writing, the accused's copy of the

record shall be forwarded to the accused's defense counsel, if any. Trial

counsel shall attach a statement to the record explaining why the accused

was not served personally. If the accused has more than one counsel, R.C.M.

1106(f)(2) shall apply. If the accused has no counsel and if the accused

is absent without authority, the trial counsel shall prepare an explanation

for the failure to serve the record. The explanation and the accused's copy

 of the record shall be forwarded with the original record. The accused shall

 be provided with a copy of the record as soon as practicable.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 13 or 14 for sample forms.

##### (D) Classified information.

###### (i) Forwarding to convening authority.

If the copy of the record of trial prepared for the accused contains

 classified information, the trial counsel, unless directed otherwise by

the convening authority, shall forward the accused's copy to the convening

authority, before it is served on the accused.

###### (ii) Responsibility of the convening authority.

The convening authority shall:

(a) cause any classified information to be deleted or withdrawn from

the accused's copy of the record of trial;

(b) cause a certificate indicating that classified information has been

 deleted or withdrawn to be attached to the record of trial; and

(c) cause the expurgated copy of the record of trial and the attached

 certificate regarding classified information to be served on the accused

as provided in subsections (b)(1)(A) and (B) of this rule except that the

accused's receipt shall show that the accused has received an expurgated

copy of the record of trial.

###### (iii) Contents of certificate.

The certificate regarding deleted or withdrawn classified information

 shall indicate:

(a) that the original record of trial may be inspected in the Office

of the Judge Advocate General concerned under such regulations as the Secretary

concerned may prescribe;

(b) the pages of the record of trial from which matter has been deleted;

(c) the pages of the record of trial which have been entirely deleted;

 and

(d) the exhibits which have been withdrawn.

####### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1103(h) concerning classified information.

##### (E) Victims of Sexual Assault.

Qualifying victims, as defined in R.C.M. 1103 (g)(3)(A), shall be served a copy of the record of trial in the same manner as the accused under subsection (b) of this rule. In accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned:

###### Discussion

Subsection (b)(1)(E) of this rule was added to implement Article 54(e), UCMJ, in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81, &sect; 586). The content of the victim's record of trial is prescribed in R.C.M. 1103(g)(3)(D).

  Promulgating orders are to be distributed in accordance with R.C.M. 1114(f).

(i) A copy of the record of trial shall be provided to each qualifying victim as soon as it is authenticated or, if the victim requests, at a time thereafter. The victim's receipt of the record of trial, including any delay in receiving it, shall be documented and attached to the original record of trial.

(ii) A copy of the convening authority's action as described in R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(D)(iv) shall be provided to each qualifying victim as soon as each document is prepared. If the victim makes a request in writing, service of the record of trial may be delayed until the action is available.

(iii) Classified information pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(D) of this rule, sealed matters pursuant to R.C.M. 1103A, or other portions of the record the release of which would unlawfully violate the privacy interests of any party, to include those afforded by 5 U.S.C.&sect;552a, the Privacy Act of 1974, shall not be provided. Matters attached to the record as described in R.C.M. 1103 (b)(3) are not required to be provided.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

The summary court-martial record of trial shall be disposed of as

 provided in R.C.M. 1305(d). Subsection (b)(1)(D) of this rule shall apply

if classified information is included in the record of trial of a summary

court-martial.

### (c) Loss of record.

If the authenticated record of trial is lost or destroyed, the trial

 counsel shall, if practicable, cause another record of trial to be prepared

for authentication. The new record of trial shall become the record of trial

in the case if the requirements of R.C.M. 1103 and this rule are met.

### (d) Correction of record after authentication; certificate of correction.

#### (1) In general.

A record of trial found to be incomplete or defective after authentication

may be corrected to make it accurate. A record of trial may be returned to

the convening authority by superior competent authority for correction under

this rule.

##### Discussion

The record of trial is corrected with a certificate of correction.

  _

See_ Appendix 13 or 14 for a form for a certificate of correction.

A certificate of correction may be used only to make the record of trial

correspond to the actual proceedings. If the members were not sworn, for

example, the error cannot be cured by a certificate of correction. If the

members were sworn but the record did not so reflect, the record could be

corrected.

#### (2) Procedure.

An authenticated record of trial believed to be incomplete or defective

may be returned to the military judge or summary court-martial for a certificate

of correction. The military judge or summary court-martial shall give notice

of the proposed correction to all parties and permit them to examine and

respond to the proposed correction before authenticating the certificate

of correction. All parties shall be given reasonable access to any original

reporter's notes or tapes of the proceedings.

##### Discussion

The type of opportunity to respond depends on the nature and scope

of the proposed correction. In many instances an adequate opportunity can

be provided by allowing the respective parties to present affidavits and

 other documentary evidence to the person authenticating the certificate of

 correction or by a conference telephone call among the authenticating person,

the parties, and the reporter. In other instances, an evidentiary hearing

 with witnesses may be required. The accused need not be present at any hearing

 on a certificate of correction.

#### (3) Authentication of certificate of correction; service on the accused.

The certificate of correction shall be authenticated as provided

in subsection (a) of this rule and a copy served on the accused as provided

in subsection (b) of this rule. The certificate of correction and the accused's

receipt for the certificate of correction shall be attached to each copy

of the record of trial required to be prepared under R.C.M. 1103(g).

### (e) Forwarding.

After every court-martial, including a rehearing and new and other

 trials, the authenticated record shall be forwarded to the convening authority

for initial review and action, provided that in case of a special court-martial

in which a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year was adjudged

or a general court-martial, the convening authority shall refer the record

to the staff judge advocate or legal officer for recommendation under R.C.M.

1106 before the convening authority takes action.

## Rule 1105. Matters submitted by the accused

**[Note: R.C.M. 1105(b)(1) and (b)(2) apply to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.]**

### (a) In general.

After a sentence is adjudged in any court-martial, the accused may

 submit matters to the convening authority in accordance with this rule.

### (b) Matters which may be submitted.

(1) The accused may submit to the convening authority any matters that may reasonably tend to affect the convening authority's decision whether to disapprove any findings of guilty or to approve the sentence, except as may be limited by R.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(C). The convening authority is only required to consider written submissions.

(2) Submissions are not subject to the Military Rules of Evidence and

may include:

(A) Allegations of errors affecting the legality of the findings or

 sentence;

(B) Portions or summaries of the record and copies of documentary evidence

offered or introduced at trial;

(C) Matters in mitigation which were not available for consideration at the court-martial, except as may be limited by R.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(B); and

###### Discussion

For example, post-trial conduct of the accused, such as providing

 restitution to the victim or exemplary behavior, might be appropriate.

(D) Clemency recommendations by any member, the military judge, or any

 other person. The defense may ask any person for such a recommendation.

###### Discussion

A clemency recommendation should state reasons for the recommendation

 and should specifically indicate the amount and character of the clemency

recommended.

  A clemency recommendation by a member should

not disclose the vote or opinion of any member expressed in deliberations.

Except as provided in R.C.M. 923 and 1008 and Mil. R. Evid. 606(b), a clemency

 recommendation does not impeach the findings or the sentence. If the sentencing

authority makes a clemency recommendation in conjunction with the announced

sentence, _see_ R.C.M. 1106(d)(3).

  Although

only written submissions must be considered, the convening authority may

consider any submission by the accused, including, but not limited to, videotapes,

 photographs, and oral presentations.

### (c) Time periods.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

After a general or special court-martial, the accused may submit

 matters under this rule within the later of 10 days after a copy of the

authenticated record of trial or, if applicable, the recommendation of the

staff judge advocate or legal officer, or an addendum to the recommendation

containing new matter is served on the accused. If, within the 10-day period,

the accused shows that additional time is required for the accused to submit

such matters, the convening authority or that authority's staff judge advocate

 may, for good cause, extend the 10-day period for not more than 20 additional

 days; however, only the convening authority may deny a request for such

an extension.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

After a summary court-martial, the accused may submit matters under

 this rule within 7 days after the sentence is announced. If the accused

shows that additional time is required for the accused to submit such comments,

the convening authority may, for good cause, extend the period in which comments

may be submitted for up to 20 additional days.

#### (3) Post-trial sessions.

A post-trial session under R.C.M. 1102 shall have no effect on the

 running of any time period in this rule, except when such session results

in the announcement of a new sentence, in which case the period shall run

from that announcement.

#### (4) Good cause.

For purposes of this rule, good cause for an extension ordinarily

 does not include the need for securing matters which could reasonably have

been presented at the court-martial.

### (d) Waiver.

#### (1) Failure to submit matters.

Failure to submit matters within the time prescribed by this rule

 shall be deemed a waiver of the right to submit such matters.

#### (2) Submission of matters.

Submission of any matters under this rule shall be deemed a waiver

of the right to submit additional matters unless the right to submit additional

matters within the prescribed time limits is expressly reserved in writing.

#### (3) Written waiver.

The accused may expressly waive, in writing, the right to submit

 matters under this rule. Once filed, such waiver may not be revoked.

#### (4) Absence of accused.

If, as a result of the unauthorized absence of the accused, the

 record cannot be served on the accused in accordance with R.C.M. 1104(b)(1)

and if the accused has no counsel to receive the record, the accused shall

be deemed to have waived the right to submit matters under this rule within

the time limit which begins upon service on the accused of the record of

trial.

##### Discussion

The accused is not required to raise objections to the trial proceedings

in order to preserve them for later review.

## Rule 1105A. Matters submitted by a crime victim

### (a) In general.

 A crime victim of an offense tried by any court-martial shall have the right to submit a written statement to the convening authority after the sentence is adjudged.

### (b) "Crime victim" defined.

 For purposes of this rule, a crime victim is a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense of which the accused was found guilty, and on which the convening authority is taking action under R.C.M. 1107. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the term includes one of the following (in order of precedence): a spouse, legal guardian, parent, child, sibling, or similarly situated family member. For a victim that is an institutional entity, the term includes an authorized representative of the entity.

### (c) Format of statement.

 The statement shall be in writing, and signed by the crime victim. Statements may include photographs, but shall not include video, audio, or other media.

#### Discussion

Statements should be submitted to the convening authority's staff judge advocate or legal officer, or, in the case of a summary court-martial, to the summary court-martial officer.

### (d) Timing of statement.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

 The crime victim shall submit the statement to the convening authority's staff judge advocate or legal officer no later than 10 days after the later of:

(A) if the victim is entitled to a copy of the record of proceedings in accordance with Article 54(e), UCMJ, the date on which the victim receives an authenticated copy of the record of trial or waives the right to receive such a copy; or

(B) the date on which the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer is served on the victim.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

 The crime victim shall submit the statement to the summary court-martial officer no later than 7 days after the sentence is announced.

#### (3) Extensions.

 If a victim shows that additional time is required for submission of matters, the convening authority or other person taking action, for good cause, may extend the submission period for not more than an additional 20 days.

### (e) Notice.

 Subject to such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, trial counsel or the summary court-martial officer shall make reasonable efforts to inform crime victims of their rights under this rule, and shall advise such crime victims on the manner in which their statements may be submitted.

### (f) Waiver.

#### (1) Failure to submit a statement.

 Failure to submit a statement within the time prescribed by this rule shall be deemed a waiver of the right to submit such a statement.

#### (2) Submission of a statement.

 Submission of a statement under this rule shall be deemed a waiver of the right to submit an additional statement.

#### (3) Written waiver.

 A crime victim may expressly waive, in writing, the right to submit a statement under this rule. Once filed, such waiver may not be revoked.

## Rule 1106. Recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer

### (a) In general.

Before the convening authority takes action under R.C.M. 1107 on a record of trial by general court-martial, on a record of trial by special court-martial that includes a sentence to a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year, or on a record of trial by special court-martial in which a victim is entitled to submit a statement pursuant to R.C.M. ll05A, that convening authority's staff judge advocate or legal officer shall, except as provided in subsection (c) of this rule, forward to the convening authority a recommendation under this rule.

### (b) Disqualification.

No person who has acted as member, military judge, trial counsel,

 assistant trial counsel, defense counsel, associate or assistant defense

counsel, or preliminary hearing officer in any case may later act as a staff judge

advocate or legal officer to any reviewing or convening authority in the

same case.

#### Discussion

The staff judge advocate or legal officer may also be ineligible

 when, for example, the staff judge advocate or legal officer; served as

the defense counsel in a companion case; testified as to a contested matter

 (unless the testimony is clearly uncontroverted); has other than an official

 interest in the same case; or must review that officer's own pretrial action

(such as the pretrial advice under Article 34; _see_ R.C.M.

406) when the sufficiency or correctness of the earlier action has been placed

in issue.

### (c) When the convening authority has no staff judge advocate.

#### (1) When the convening authority does not have a staff judge advocate or

 legal officer or that person is disqualified.

If the convening authority does not have a staff judge advocate

or legal officer, or if the person serving in that capacity is disqualified

under subsection (b) of this rule or otherwise, the convening authority

shall:

(A) Request the assignment of another staff judge advocate or legal

 officer to prepare a recommendation under this rule; or

(B) Forward the record for action to any officer exercising general

 court-martial jurisdiction as provided in R.C.M. 1107(a).

#### (2) When the convening authority has a legal officer but wants the recommendation

of a staff judge advocate.

If the convening authority has a legal officer but no staff judge

 advocate, the convening authority may, as a matter of discretion, request

designation of a staff judge advocate to prepare the recommendation.

### (d) Form and content of recommendation.

(1) The purpose of the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer is to assist the convening authority to decide what action to take on the sentence in the exercise of command prerogative.  The staff judge advocate or legal officer shall use the record of trial in the preparation of the recommendation, and may also use the personnel records of the accused or other matters in advising the convening authority whether clemency is warranted.

#### (2) Form.

The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall be a concise written communication.

#### (3) Required contents.

Except as provided in subsection (e), the staff judge advocate or legal advisor shall provide the convening authority with a copy of the report of results of the trial, setting forth the findings, sentence, and confinement credit to be applied; a copy or summary of the pretrial agreement, if any; a copy of any statement submitted by a crime victim pursuant to R.C.M. 1l05A; any recommendation for clemency by the sentencing authority made in conjunction with the announced sentence; and the staff judge advocate's concise recommendation.

##### Discussion

 The recommendation required by this rule need not include information regarding other recommendations for clemency. It may include a summary of clemency actions authorized under R.C.M. 1107. _See_ R.C.M. 1105(b)(2)(D) (pertaining to clemency recommendations that may be submitted by the accused to the convening authority).

##### (4) Legal errors.

The staff judge advocate or legal officer is not required to examine the record for legal errors.  However, when the recommendation is prepared by a staff judge advocate, the staff judge advocate shall state whether, in the staff judge advocate's opinion, corrective action on the findings or sentence should be taken when an allegation of legal error is raised in matters submitted under R.C.M. 1105 or when otherwise deemed appropriate by the staff judge advocate.  The response may consist of a statement of agreement or disagreement with the matter raised by the accused.  An analysis or rationale for the staff judge advocate's statement, if any, concerning legal error is not required.

##### (5) Optional matters.

The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer may include, in addition to matters included under subsection (d)(3) and (4) of this rule, any additional matters deemed appropriate by the staff judge advocate or legal officer.  Such matter may include matters outside the record.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(B)(iii) if matters adverse to the accused from outside the record are included.

##### (6) Effect of error.

In case of error in the recommendation not otherwise waived under subsection (f)(6) of this rule, appropriate corrective action shall be taken by appellate authorities without returning the case for further action by a convening authority.

### (e) No findings of guilty; findings of not guilty only by reason of lack

of mental responsibility.

If the proceedings resulted in an acquittal or in a finding of not

 guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility of all charges and

specifications, or if, after the trial began, the proceedings were terminated

without findings and no further action is contemplated, a recommendation

under this rule is not required.

### (f) Service of recommendation on defense counsel, accused,

and victim; defense response.

#### (1) Service of recommendation on defense counsel, accused, and victim.

 Before forwarding the recommendation and the record of trial to the convening authority for action under R.C.M. 1107, the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall cause a copy of the recommendation to be served on the counsel for the accused. A separate copy will be served on the accused. If it is impracticable to serve the recommendation on the accused for reasons including the transfer of the accused to a different place, the unauthorized absence of the accused, or military exigency, or if the accused so requests on the record at the court-martial or in writing, the accused's copy shall be forwarded to the accused's defense counsel. A statement shall be attached to the record explaining why the accused was not served personally. If the accused was found guilty of any offense that resulted in direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm to a victim or victims, a separate copy of the recommendation will be served on that victim or those victims. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, deceased, or otherwise unavailable, service shall be made on one of the following (in order of precedence): the victim's attorney, spouse, legal guardian, parent, child, sibling, or similarly situated family member. For a victim that is an institutional entity, service shall be made on an authorized representative of the entity.

##### Discussion

The method of service and the form of the proof of service are not

 prescribed and may be by any appropriate means. _See_ R.C.M.

1103(b)(3)(G). For example, a certificate of service, attached to the record

of trial, would be appropriate when the accused is served personally.

#### (2) Counsel for the accused.

The accused may, at trial or in writing to the staff judge advocate

 or legal officer before the recommendation has been served under this rule,

designate which counsel (detailed, individual military, or civilian) will

be served with the recommendation. In the absence of such designation, the

staff judge advocate or legal officer shall cause the recommendation to be

served in the following order of precedence, as applicable, on: (1) civilian

counsel; (2) individual military counsel; or (3) detailed defense counsel.

If the accused has not retained civilian counsel and the detailed defense

counsel and individual military counsel, if any, have been relieved or are

not reasonably available to represent the accused, substitute military counsel

to represent the accused shall be detailed by an appropriate authority. Substitute

counsel shall enter into an attorney-client relationship with the accused

before examining the recommendation and preparing any response.

##### Discussion

When the accused is represented by more than one counsel, the military

judge should inquire of the accused and counsel before the end of the court-martial

as to who will act for the accused under this rule.

#### (3) Record of trial.

The staff judge advocate or legal officer shall, upon request of

 counsel for the accused served with the recommendation, provide that counsel

with a copy of the record of trial for use while preparing the response

to the recommendation.

#### (4) Response.

Counsel for the accused may submit, in writing, corrections or rebuttal to any matter in the recommendation and its enclosures believed to be erroneous, inadequate, or misleading, and may comment on any other matter.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1105.

#### (5) Time period.

Counsel for the accused shall be given 10 days from service of the

 record of trial under R.C.M. 1104(b) or receipt of the recommendation, whichever

is later, in which to submit comments on the recommendation. The convening

authority may, for good cause, extend the period in which comments may be

submitted for up to 20 additional days.

#### (6) Waiver.

Failure of counsel for the accused to comment on any matter in the

 recommendation or matters attached to the recommendation in a timely manner

shall waive later claim of error with regard to such matter in the absence

of plain error.

##### Discussion

The accused is not required to raise objections to the trial proceedings

in order to preserve them for later review.

#### (7) New matter in addendum to recommendation.

The staff judge advocate or legal officer may supplement the recommendation

after the accused and counsel for the accused have been served with the recommendation

and given an opportunity to comment. When new matter is introduced after

the accused and counsel for the accused have examined the recommendation,

 however, the accused and counsel for the accused must be served with the

new matter and given 10 days from service of the addendum in which to submit

comments. Substitute service of the accused's copy of the addendum upon

counsel for the accused is permitted in accordance with the procedures outlined

in subparagraph (f)(1) of this rule.

##### Discussion

"New matter" includes discussion of the effect of new decisions on issues in the case, matter from outside the record of trial, and issues not previously discussed. "New matter" does not ordinarily include any discussion by the staff judge advocate or legal officer of the correctness of the initial defense comments on the recommendation. The method of service and the form of the proof of service are not prescribed and may be by any appropriate means. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(G). For example, a certificate of service, attached to the record of trial, would be appropriate when the accused is served personally. If a victim statement, submitted under R.C.M. 1105A, is served on the accused prior to service of the recommendation, then that statement shall not be considered a "new matter" when it is again served on the accused as an enclosure to the recommendation.

## Rule 1107. Action by convening authority

**[Note: R.C.M. 1107(b)-(f) apply to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014; however, if at least one offense in a case occurred prior to 24 June 2014, then the prior version of RCM 1107 applies to all offenses in the case, except that mandatory minimum sentences under Article 56(b) and applicable rules under RCM 1107(d)(1)(D)-(E) still apply.]**

### (a) Who may take action.

The convening authority shall take action on the sentence and, in

the discretion of the convening authority, the findings, unless it is impracticable.

If it is impracticable for the convening authority to act, the convening

authority shall, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned

may prescribe, forward the case to an officer exercising general court-martial

 jurisdiction who may take action under this rule.

#### Discussion

The convening authority may not delegate the function of taking

 action on the findings or sentence. The convening authority who convened

the court-martial may take action on the case regardless whether the accused

is a member of or present in the convening authority's command.

  It

would be impracticable for the convening authority to take initial action

when, for example, a command has been decommissioned or inactivated before

the convening authority's action; when a command has been alerted for immediate

overseas movement; or when the convening authority is disqualified because

 the convening authority has other than an official interest in the case or

 because a member of the court-martial which tried the accused later became

the convening authority.

  If the convening authority forwards

the case to an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction for

initial review and action, the record should include a statement of the reasons

why the convening authority did not act.

### (b) General considerations.

#### (1) Discretion of convening authority.

Any action to be taken on the findings and sentence is within the sole discretion of the convening authority. The convening authority is not required to review the case for legal errors or factual sufficiency.

##### Discussion

The action is taken in the interests of justice, discipline, mission

 requirements, clemency, and other appropriate reasons. If errors are noticed

by the convening authority, the convening authority may take corrective

action under this rule.

#### (2) When action may be taken.

The convening authority may take action only after the applicable

 time periods under R.C.M. 1105(c) have expired or the accused has waived

the right to present matters under R.C.M. 1105(d), whichever is earlier,

subject to regulations of the Secretary concerned.

#### (3) Matters considered.

##### (A) Required matters.

Before taking action, the convening authority shall consider:

(i) The result of trial;

####### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1101(a).

(ii) The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer

under R.C.M. 1106, if applicable; and

(iii) Any matters submitted by the accused under R.C.M. 1105 or, if applicable, R.C.M. 1106(f);

(iv) Any statement submitted by a crime victim pursuant to R.C.M. 1105A and subsection (C) below.

##### (B) Additional matters.

Before taking action the convening authority may consider:

(i) The record of trial, subject to the provisions of R.C.M. 1103A and subsection (C) below;

(ii) The personnel records of the accused; and

(iii) Such other matters as the convening authority deems appropriate.

 However, if the convening authority considers matters adverse to the accused

from outside the record, with knowledge of which the accused is not chargeable,

the accused shall be notified and given an opportunity to rebut.

##### (C) Prohibited matters.

The convening authority shall not consider any matters that relate to the character of a victim unless such matters were presented as evidence at trial and not excluded at trial.

#### (4) When proceedings resulted in finding of not guilty or not guilty only

by reason of lack of mental responsibility, or there was a ruling amounting

to a finding of not guilty.

The convening authority shall not take action disapproving a finding

 of not guilty, a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental

responsibility, or a ruling amounting to a finding of not guilty. When an

accused is found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility,

the convening authority, however, shall commit the accused to a suitable

facility pending a hearing and disposition in accordance with R.C.M. 1102A.

##### Discussion

Commitment of the accused to the custody of the Attorney General

for hospitalization is discretionary.

#### (5) Action when accused lacks mental capacity.

The convening authority may not approve a sentence while the accused

 lacks mental capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligently

in the post-trial proceedings. In the absence of substantial evidence to

the contrary, the accused is presumed to have the capacity to understand

and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the post-trial proceedings.

If a substantial question is raised as to the requisite mental capacity

of the accused, the convening authority may direct an examination of the

accused in accordance with R.C.M. 706 before deciding whether the accused

lacks mental capacity, but the examination may be limited to determining

 the accused's present capacity to understand and cooperate in the post-trial

 proceedings. The convening authority may approve the sentence unless it

is established, by a preponderance of the evidence-including matters

outside the record of trial-that the accused does not have the requisite

mental capacity. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the convening

authority from disapproving the findings of guilty and sentence.

### (c) Action on findings.

Action on the findings is not required. However, the convening authority may take action subject to the following limitations:

(1) For offenses charged under subsection (a) or (b) of Article 120; offenses charged under Article 120b; and offenses charged under Article 125.

(A) The convening authority is prohibited from:

(i) Setting aside any finding of guilt or dismissing a specification; or

(ii) Changing a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification.

(B) The convening authority may direct a rehearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule.

(2) For offenses other than those listed in subsection (c)(1) for which the maximum sentence of confinement that may be adjudged does not exceed two years without regard to the jurisdictional limits of the court; and the sentence adjudged does not include dismissal, a dishonorable discharge, bad-conduct discharge, or confinement for more than six months:

(A) The convening authority may change a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification; or

(B) Set aside any finding of guilty and:

(i) Dismiss the specification and, if appropriate, the charge; or

(ii) Direct a rehearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule.

(3) If the convening authority acts to dismiss or change any charge or specification for an offense, the convening authority shall provide, at the same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.

### (d) Action on the sentence.

#### (1) In general.

(A) The convening authority may not disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, any portion of an adjudged sentence of confinement for more than six months.

(B) The convening authority may not disapprove, commute, or suspend that portion of an adjudged sentence that includes a dismissal, dishonorable discharge, or bad-conduct discharge.

(C) The convening authority may disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, any portion of an adjudged sentence not explicitly prohibited by this rule, to include reduction in pay grade, forfeitures of pay and allowances, fines, reprimands, restrictions, and hard labor without confinement.

(D) The convening authority shall not disapprove, commute, or suspend any mandatory minimum sentence of dismissal or dishonorable discharge except in accordance with subsection (E) below.

##### (E) Exceptions.

###### (i) Trial counsel recommendation.

 Upon the recommendation of the trial counsel, in recognition of the substantial assistance by the accused in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section shall have the authority to disapprove, commute, or suspend the adjudged sentence, in whole or in part, even with respect to an offense for which a mandatory minimum sentence exists.

####### Discussion

 The phrase "investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense" includes offenses under the UCMJ or other Federal, State, local, or foreign criminal statutes.

###### (ii) Pretrial agreement.

 If a pretrial agreement has been entered into by the convening authority and the accused as authorized by R.C.M. 705, the convening authority shall have the authority to approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend a sentence, in whole or in part, pursuant to the terms of the pretrial agreement. The convening authority may commute a mandatory sentence of a dishonorable discharge to a bad-conduct discharge pursuant to the terms of the pretrial agreement.

(F) If the convening authority acts to disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, the sentence of the court-martial for an offense, the convening authority shall provide, at the same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.

###### Discussion

 A sentence adjudged by a court-martial may be approved if it was within the jurisdiction of the court-martial to adjudge (_see_ R.C.M.201(f)) and did not exceed the maximum limits prescribed in Part IV and Chapter X of this Part for the offense(s) of which the accused legally has been found guilty.

 When mitigating forfeitures, the duration and amounts of forfeiture may be changed as long as the total amount forfeited is not increased and neither the amount nor duration of the forfeitures exceeds the jurisdiction of the court-martial. When mitigating confinement or hard labor without confinement, the convening authority should use the equivalencies at

R.C.M. 1003(b)(5)-(6), as appropriate.

 Unless prohibited by this rule, the convening authority may disapprove, mitigate or change to a less severe punishment any individual component of a sentence. For example, if an accused is found guilty of assault consummated by a battery and sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, three months of confinement, and reduction to E-1, without a pre-trial agreement and without being able to apply the substantial assistance exception, the convening authority may disapprove or reduce any part of the sentence except the bad-conduct discharge.

#### (2) Determining what sentence should be approved.

The convening authority shall, subject to the limitations in subsection (d)(1) above, approve that sentence which is warranted by the circumstances of the offense and appropriate for the accused.

##### Discussion

 In determining what sentence should be approved, the convening authority should consider all relevant and permissible factors including the possibility of rehabilitation, the deterrent effect of the sentence, and all matters relating to clemency, such as pretrial confinement. _See also_ R.C.M. 1001- 1004.

 When an accused is not serving confinement, the accused should not be deprived of more than two-thirds pay for any month as a result of one or more sentences by court-martial and other stoppages or involuntary deductions, unless requested by the accused. Since court-martial forfeitures constitute a loss of entitlement of the pay concerned, they take precedence over all debts.

#### (3) Deferring service of a sentence to confinement.

(A) In a case in which a court-martial sentences an accused referred

to in subsection (B), below, to confinement, the convening authority may

defer service of a sentence to confinement by a court-martial, without the

consent of the accused, until after the accused has been permanently released

to the armed forces by a state or foreign country.

(B) Subsection (A) applies to an accused who, while in custody of a

state or foreign country, is temporarily returned by that state or foreign

country to the armed forces for trial by court-martial; and after the court-martial,

is returned to that state or foreign country under the authority of a mutual

 agreement or treaty, as the case may be.

(C) As used in subsection (d)(3), the term "state" means

a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, a territory, and

a possession of the United States.

###### Discussion

The convening authority's decision to postpone service of a court-martial

sentence to confinement normally should be reflected in the action.

#### (4) Limitations on sentence based on record of trial.

If the record of trial does not meet the requirements of R.C.M.

 1103(b)(2)(B) or (c)(1), the convening authority may not approve a sentence

in excess of that which may be adjudged by a special court-martial, or one

that includes a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months,

forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture of

pay for more than six months.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(f).

#### (5) Limitations on sentence of a special court-martial where a fine has

been adjudged.

A convening authority may not approve in its entirety a sentence

 adjudged at a special court-martial when, if approved, the cumulative impact

of the fine and forfeitures, whether adjudged or by operation of Article

58b, would exceed the jurisdictional maximum dollar amount of forfeitures

that may be adjudged at that court-martial.

### (e) Ordering rehearing or other trial.

#### (1) Rehearing.

##### (A) In general.

Subject to subsections (e)(1)(B) through (e)(1)(E) of this rule,

the convening authority may in the convening authority's discretion order

a rehearing. A rehearing may be ordered as to some or all offenses of which

 findings of guilty were entered and the sentence, or as to sentence only.

###### Discussion

A rehearing may be appropriate when an error substantially affecting

 the findings or sentence is noticed by the convening authority. The severity

of the findings or the sentence of the original court-martial may not be

 increased at a rehearing unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is

 mandatory. _See_ R.C.M. 810(d). If the accused is placed

under restraint pending a rehearing, _ see_ R.C.M. 304; 305.

##### (B) When the convening authority may order a rehearing.

The convening authority may order a rehearing:

(i) When taking action on the court-martial under this rule;

(ii) In cases subject to review by the Court of Criminal Appeals, before the case is forwarded under R.C.M. 1111(a)(1) or (b)(1), but only as to any sentence which was approved or findings of guilty as we not disapproved in any earlier action.  In cases of rehearing under paragraph (c)(2), a supplemental action disapproving the sentence and some or all of the findings , as appropriate, shall be taken; or

###### (iii) When authorized to do so by superior competent authority.

If the convening authority finds a rehearing as to any offenses

 impracticable, the convening authority may dismiss those specifications

and, when appropriate, charges.

####### Discussion

A sentence rehearing, rather than a reassessment, may be more appropriate

in cases where a significant part of the government's case has been dismissed.

 The convening authority may not take any actions inconsistent with directives

of superior competent authority. Where that directive is unclear, appropriate

clarification should be sought from the authority issuing the original directive.

###### (iv) Sentence reassessment.

If a superior authority has approved some of the findings of guilty

and has authorized a rehearing as to other offenses and the sentence, the

convening authority may, unless otherwise directed, reassess the sentence

based on the approved findings of guilty and dismiss the remaining charges.

 Reassessment is appropriate only where the convening authority determines

that the accused's sentence would have been at least of a certain magnitude

had the prejudicial error not been committed and the reassessed sentence is

appropriate in relation to the affirmed findings of guilty.

##### (C) Limitations.

###### (i) Sentence approved.

A rehearing shall not be ordered if, in the same action, a sentence

 is approved.

###### (ii) Rehearing on sentence only.

A rehearing on sentence only shall not be referred to a different

 kind of court-martial from that which made the original findings. If the

convening authority determines a rehearing on sentence is impracticable,

 the convening authority may approve a sentence of no punishment without

conducting a rehearing.

##### (D) Additional charges.

Additional charges may be referred for trial together with charges

as to which a rehearing has been directed.

##### (E) Lesser included offenses.

If at a previous trial the accused was convicted of a lesser included

 offense, a rehearing may be ordered only as to that included offense or

as to an offense included in that found. If, however, a rehearing is ordered

improperly on the original offense charged and the accused is convicted of

that offense at the rehearing, the finding as to the lesser included offense

of which the accused was convicted at the original trial may nevertheless

be approved.

#### (2) "Other" trial.

The convening or higher authority may order an "other"

 trial if the original proceedings were invalid because of lack of jurisdiction

or failure of a specification to state an offense. The authority ordering

an "other" trial shall state in the action the basis for declaring

the proceedings invalid.

### (f) Contents of action and related matters.

#### (1) In general.

The convening authority shall state in writing and insert in the

 record of trial the convening authority's decision as to the sentence, whether

any findings of guilty are disapproved, and orders as to further disposition.

 The action shall be signed personally by the convening authority. The convening

authority's authority to sign shall appear below the signature.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 16 for forms.

#### (2) Modification of initial action.

Subject to the limitations in subsections (c) and (d) above, the convening authority may recall and modify any action taken by that convening authority at any time before it has been published or before the accused has been officially notified. The convening authority may also recall and modify any action at any time prior to forwarding the record for review, as long as the modification does not result in action less favorable to the accused than the earlier action. In addition, in any special court-martial, the convening authority may recall and correct an illegal, erroneous, incomplete, or ambiguous action at any time before completion of review under R.C.M. 1112, as long as the correction does not result in action less favorable to the accused than the earlier action. When so directed by a higher reviewing authority or the Judge Advocate General, the convening authority shall modify any incomplete, ambiguous, void, or inaccurate action noted in review of the record of trial under Articles 64, 66, 67, or examination of the record of trial under Article 69. The convening authority shall personally sign any supplementary or corrective action. A written explanation is required for any modification of initial action which: 1) sets aside any finding of guilt or dismisses or changes any charge or specification for an offense; or 2) disapproves, commutes, or suspends, in whole or in part, the sentence. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.

##### Discussion

For purposes of this rule, a record is considered to have been

forwarded for review when the convening authority has either delivered it

in person or has entrusted it for delivery to a third party over whom the

 convening authority exercises no lawful control (_e.g._, the

 United States Postal Service).

#### (3) Findings of guilty.

If any findings of guilty are disapproved, the action shall so state.

 If a rehearing is not ordered, the affected charges and specifications shall

be dismissed by the convening authority in the action. If a rehearing or

other trial is directed, the reasons for the disapproval shall be set forth

 in the action.

##### Discussion

If a rehearing or other trial is not directed, the reasons for

disapproval need not be stated in the action, but they may be when appropriate.

It may be appropriate to state them when the reasons may affect administrative

disposition of the accused; for example, when the finding is disapproved

because of the lack of mental responsibility of the accused or the running

of the statute of limitations.

  No express action is necessary

to approve findings of guilty. _See_ subsection (c) of this

rule.

#### (4) Action on sentence.

##### (A) In general.

The action shall state whether the sentence adjudged by the court-martial

is approved. If only part of the sentence is approved, the action shall state

which parts are approved. A rehearing may not be directed if any sentence

is approved.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 16 for forms.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1108 concerning suspension of sentences.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1113 concerning execution of sentences.

##### (B) Execution; suspension.

The action shall indicate, when appropriate, whether an approved

 sentence is to be executed or whether the execution of all or any part of

the sentence is to be suspended. No reasons need be stated.

##### (C) Place of confinement.

If the convening authority orders a sentence of confinement into

 execution, the convening authority shall designate the place of confinement

in the action, unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned. If

a sentence of confinement is ordered into execution after the initial action

of the convening authority, the authority ordering the execution shall designate

the place of confinement unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(2)(C) concerning the place

of confinement.

##### (D) Custody or confinement pending appellate review; capital cases.

When a record of trial involves an approved sentence to death, the

 convening authority shall, unless any approved sentence of confinement has

been ordered into execution and a place of confinement designated, provide

in the action for the temporary custody or confinement of the accused pending

final disposition of the case on appellate review.

##### (E) Deferment of service of sentence to confinement.

Whenever the service of the sentence to confinement is deferred

by the convening authority under R.C.M. 1101(c) before or concurrently with

the initial action in the case, the action shall include the date on which

the deferment became effective. The reason for the deferment need not be

 stated in the action.

##### (F) Credit for illegal pretrial confinement.

When the military judge has directed that the accused receive credit

 under R.C.M. 305(k), the convening authority shall so direct in the action.

##### (G) Reprimand.

The convening authority shall include in the action any reprimand

 which the convening authority has ordered executed.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1003(b)(1) concerning reprimands.

#### (5) Action on rehearing or new or other trial.

##### (A) Rehearing or other trial.

In acting on a rehearing or other trial the convening authority

shall be subject to the sentence limitations prescribed in R.C.M. 810(d).

Except when a rehearing or other trial is combined with a trial on additional

offenses and except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 810(d), if any part

of the original sentence was suspended and the suspension was not properly

vacated before the order directing the rehearing, the convening authority

shall take the necessary suspension action to prevent an increase in the

same type of punishment as was previously suspended. The convening authority

may approve a sentence adjudged upon a rehearing or other trial regardless

whether any kind or amount of the punishment adjudged at the former trial

has been served or executed. However, in computing the term or amount of punishment

to be actually served or executed under the new sentence, the accused shall

be credited with any kind or amount of the former sentence included within

the new sentence that was served or executed before the time it was disapproved

or set aside. The convening authority shall, if any part of a sentence adjudged

upon a rehearing or other trial is approved, direct in the action that any

part or amount of the former sentence served or executed between the date

it was adjudged and the date it was disapproved or set aside shall be credited

 to the accused. If, in the action on the record of a rehearing, the convening

 authority disapproves the findings of guilty of all charges and specifications

which were tried at the former hearing and that part of the sentence which

was based on these findings, the convening authority shall, unless a further

 rehearing is ordered, provide in the action that all rights, privileges,

and property affected by any executed portion of the sentence adjudged at

the former hearing shall be restored. The convening authority shall take

 the same restorative action if a court-martial at a rehearing acquits the

 accused of all charges and specifications which were tried at the former

hearing.

##### (B) New trial.

The action of the convening authority on a new trial shall, insofar

 as practicable, conform to the rules prescribed for rehearings and other

trials in subsection (f)(5)(A) of this rule.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 810 for procedures at other trials.

  In approving a sentence not in excess of or more severe than one previously approved (_see_ R.C.M. 810(d)), a convening authority is prohibited from approving a punitive discharge more severe than one formerly approved, e.g., a convening authority is prohibited from approving a dishonorable discharge if a bad conduct discharge had formerly been approved.  Otherwise, in approving a sentence not in excess of or more severe than one previously imposed, a convening authority is not limited to approving the same or lesser type of "other punishments" formerly approved.

### (g) Incomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous action.

When the action of the convening authority or of a higher authority is incomplete or ambiguous or contains error, the authority who took the incomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous action may be instructed by an authority acting under Articles 64, 66, 67, 67a, or 69 to withdraw the original action and substitute a corrected action.

### (h) Service on accused.

A copy of the convening authority's action shall be served on the

 accused or on defense counsel. If the action is served on defense counsel,

 defense counsel shall, by expeditious means, provide the accused with a

copy.

#### Discussion

If the promulgating order is prepared promptly, service of it will

 satisfy subsection (h).

## Rule 1108. Suspension of execution of sentence; remission

### (a) In general.

Suspension of a sentence grants the accused a probationary period

 during which the suspended part of an approved sentence is not executed,

and upon the accused's successful completion of which the suspended part

of the sentence shall be remitted. Remission cancels the unexecuted part

 of a sentence to which it applies.

### (b) Who may suspend and remit.

**[Note: R.C.M. 1108(b) applies to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.]**

The convening authority may, after approving the sentence, suspend the execution of all or any part of the sentence of a court-martial, except for a sentence of death or as prohibited under R.C.M. 1107(d). The general court-martial convening authority over the accused at the time of the court-martial may, when taking action under R.C.M. 1112(f), suspend or remit any part of the sentence. The Secretary concerned and, when designated by the Secretary concerned, any Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Judge Advocate General, or commanding officer may suspend or remit any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence other than a sentence approved by the President or a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole that has been ordered executed. The Secretary concerned may, however, suspend or remit the unexecuted part of a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole only after the service of a period of confinement of not less than 20 years. The commander of the accused who has the authority to convene a court-martial of the kind that adjudged the sentence may suspend or remit any part of the unexecuted part of any sentence by summary court-martial or of any sentence by special court-martial that does not include a bad-conduct discharge regardless of whether the person acting has previously approved the sentence. The "unexecuted part of any sentence" is that part that has been approved and ordered executed but that has not actually been carried out.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1113 (execution of sentences); R.C.M.

 1201 (action by the Judge Advocate General); R.C.M. 1206 (powers and responsibilities

of the Secretary).

  The military judge and members of courts-martial

may not suspend sentences.

### (c) Conditions of suspension.

The authority who suspends the execution of the sentence of a court-martial

shall:

(1) Specify in writing the conditions of the suspension;

(2) Cause a copy of the conditions of the suspension to be served on

the probationer; and

(3) Cause a receipt to be secured from the probationer for service of

the conditions of the suspension.

 Unless otherwise stated, an

action suspending a sentence includes as a condition that the probationer

 not violate any punitive article of the code.

### (d) Limitations on suspension.

Suspension shall be for a stated period or until the occurrence

of an anticipated future event. The period shall not be unreasonably long.

The Secretary concerned may further limit by regulations the period for

which the execution of a sentence may be suspended. The convening authority

shall provide in the action that unless the suspension is sooner vacated,

the expiration of the period of suspension shall remit the suspended portion

of the sentence. An appropriate authority may, before the expiration of the

period of suspension, remit any part of the sentence, including a part which

has been suspended; reduce the period of suspension; or, subject to R.C.M.

1109, vacate the suspension in whole or in part.

### (e) Termination of suspension by remission.

Expiration of the period provided in the action suspending a sentence

 or part of a sentence shall remit the suspended portion unless the suspension

is sooner vacated. Death or separation which terminates status as a person

subject to the code shall result in remission of the suspended portion of

the sentence.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1109(b)(4) concerning interruption

of the period of suspension.

## Rule 1109. Vacation of suspension of sentence

### (a) In general.

Suspension of execution of the sentence of a court-martial may be

 vacated for violation of the conditions of the suspension as provided in

this rule.

### (b) Timeliness.

#### (1) Violation of conditions.

Vacation shall be based on a violation of the conditions of suspension

which occurs within the period of suspension.

#### (2) Vacation proceedings.

Vacation proceedings under this rule shall be completed within a

 reasonable time.

#### (3) Order vacating the suspension.

The order vacating the suspension shall be issued before the expiration

of the period of suspension.

##### Discussion

The order vacating a suspended sentence must be issued before the

end of suspension even though, in certain cases, it may not be effective

as an order of execution of the suspended sentence until the completion

of appellate review or action by the President or the Secretary concerned.

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113 concerning execution of sentences.

#### (4) Interruptions to the period of suspension.

Unauthorized absence of the probationer or the commencement of

proceedings under this rule to vacate suspension interrupts the running of

the period of suspension.

### (c) Confinement of probationer pending vacation proceedings.

#### (1) In general.

A probationer under a suspended sentence to confinement may be

confined pending action under subsection (d)(2) of this rule, in accordance

with the procedures in this subsection.

#### (2) Who may order confinement.

Any person who may order pretrial restraint under R.C.M. 304(b)

may order confinement of a probationer under a suspended sentence to confinement.

#### (3) Basis for confinement.

A probationer under a suspended sentence to confinement may be

ordered into confinement upon probable cause to believe the probationer violated

any conditions of the suspension.

##### Discussion

A determination that confinement is necessary to ensure the presence

 of the probationer or to prevent further misconduct is not required.

  If

the violation of the conditions also constitutes an offense under the code

for which trial by court-martial is considered, an appropriate form of pretrial

 restraint may be imposed as an alternative to confinement under this rule. _

See_ R.C.M. 304 and 305.

#### (4) Review of confinement.

Unless proceedings under subsection (d)(1), (e), (f), or (g) of

this rule are completed within 7 days of imposition of confinement of the

probationer (not including any delays requested by probationer), a preliminary

hearing shall be conducted by a neutral and detached officer appointed in

accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

##### (A) Rights of accused.

 Before the preliminary hearing, the accused shall be notified in

 writing of:

(i) The time, place, and purpose of the hearing, including the alleged

 violation(s) of the conditions of suspension;

(ii) The right to be present at the hearing;

(iii) The right to be represented at the hearing by civilian counsel

provided by the probationer or, upon request, by military counsel detailed

for this purpose; and

(iv) The opportunity to be heard, to present witnesses who are reasonably

 available and other evidence, and the right to confront and cross-examine

adverse witnesses unless the hearing officer determines that this would

subject these witnesses to risk or harm. For purposes of this subsection,

a witness is not reasonably available if the witness requires reimbursement

by the United States for cost incurred in appearing, cannot appear without

unduly delaying the proceedings or, if a military witness, cannot be excused

from other important duties.

##### (B) Rules of evidence.

Except for Mil. R. Evid. Section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid.

302 and 305, the Military Rules of Evidence shall not apply to matters considered

at the preliminary hearing under this rule.

##### (C) Decision.

The hearing officer shall determine whether there is probable cause

 to believe that the probationer violated the conditions of the probationer's

suspension. If the hearing officer determines that probable cause is lacking,

the hearing officer shall issue a written order directing that the probationer

released from confinement. If the hearing officer determines that there is

probable cause to believe that the probationer violated the conditions of

suspension, the hearing officer shall set forth in a written memorandum,

detailing therein the evidence relied upon and reasons for making the decision.

 The hearing officer shall forward the original memorandum or release order

to the probationer's commander and forward a copy to the probationer and

 the officer in charge of the confinement facility.

### (d) Vacation of suspended general court-martial sentence.

#### (1) Action by officer having special court-martial jurisdiction over probationer.

##### (A) In general.

Before vacation of the suspension of any general court-martial

sentence, the officer having special court-martial jurisdiction over the

probationer shall personally hold a hearing on the alleged violation of

the conditions of suspension. If there is no officer having special court-martial

jurisdiction over the probationer who is subordinate to the officer having

general court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer, the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer shall personally

hold a hearing under subsection (d)(1) of this rule. In such cases, subsection

(d)(1)(D) of this rule shall not apply.

##### (B) Notice to probationer.

Before the hearing, the officer conducting the hearing shall cause

 the probationer to be notified in writing of:

(i) The time, place, and purpose of the hearing;

(ii) The right to be present at the hearing;

(iii) The alleged violation(s) of the conditions of suspension and the

 evidence expected to be relied on;

(iv) The right to be represented at the hearing by civilian counsel

provided by the probationer or, upon request, by military counsel detailed

for this purpose; and

(v) The opportunity to be heard, to present witnesses and other evidence,

 and the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses unless the

hearing officer determines that there is good cause for not allowing confrontation

and cross-examination.

####### Discussion

The notice should be provided sufficiently in advance of the hearing

 to permit adequate preparation.

##### (C) Hearing.

The procedure for the vacation hearing shall follow that prescribed

 in R.C.M. 405(g), (h)(1), and (i).

##### (D) Record and recommendation.

The officer who conducts the vacation proceeding shall make a summarized

record of the proceeding and forward the record and that officer's written

recommendation concerning vacation to the officer exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction over the probationer.

##### (E) Release from confinement.

If the special court-martial convening authority finds there is

not probable cause to believe that the probationer violated the conditions

of the suspension, the special court-martial convening authority shall order

the release of the probationer from any confinement ordered under subsection

(c) of this rule. The special court-martial convening authority shall, in

any event, forward the record and recommendation under subsection (d)(1)(D)

of this rule.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 18 for a sample of a Report of Proceedings

to Vacate Suspension of a General Court-Martial Sentence under Article 72,

UCMJ, and R.C.M. 1109 (DD Form 455).

#### (2) Action by officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over

 probationer.

##### (A) In general.

The officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the

 probationer shall review the record produced by and the recommendation of

the officer exercising special court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer,

decide whether the probationer violated a condition of suspension, and, if

so, decide whether to vacate the suspended sentence. If the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction decides to vacate the suspended sentence,

that officer shall prepare a written statement of the evidence relied on

and the reasons for vacating the suspended sentence.

##### (B) Execution.

Any unexecuted part of a suspended sentence ordered vacated under

 this rule shall, subject to R.C.M. 1113(c), be ordered executed.

### (e)  Vacation of a suspended special court-martial sentence wherein a

bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year was not adjudged.

#### (1) In general.

Before vacating the suspension of a special court-martial punishment

 that does not include a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year,

the special court-martial convening authority for the command in which the

 probationer is serving or assigned shall cause a hearing to be held on the

 alleged violation(s) of the conditions of suspension.

#### (2) Notice to probationer.

The person conducting the hearing shall notify the probationer,

in writing, before the hearing of the rights specified in subsection (d)(1)(B)

 the suspension, the person who conducts the hearing shall make a summarized

record of the hearing and forward the record and that officer's written

recommendation concerning vacation to the commander with authority to vacate

the suspension.

#### (6) Decision.

The special court-martial convening authority shall review the record

 produced by and the recommendation of the person who conducted the vacation

proceeding, decide whether the probationer violated a condition of suspension,

and, if so, decide whether to vacate the suspended sentence.  If the officer

exercising jurisdiction decides to vacate the suspended sentence, that officer

shall prepare a written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons

for vacating the suspended sentence.

#### (7) Execution.

Any unexecuted part of a suspended sentence ordered vacated under

 this subsection shall be ordered executed.

### (f)  Vacation of a suspended special court-martial sentence that includes

a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year.

(1) The procedure for the vacation of a suspended approved bad-conduct

 discharge or of any suspended portion of an approved sentence to confinement

for one year, shall follow that set forth in subsection (d) of this rule.

(2) The procedure for the vacation of a suspension of any lesser special

 court-martial punishment shall follow that set forth in subsection (e) of

this rule.

##### Discussion

An officer exercising special court-martial jurisdiction may vacate

 any suspended punishments other than an approved suspended bad-conduct discharge

or any suspended portion of an approved sentence to confinement for one

year, regardless of whether they are contained in the same sentence as the

bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year. See Appendix 18 for a

sample of a Report of Proceedings to Vacate Suspension of a Special Court-Martial

Sentence including a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year under

Article 72, UCMJ, and R.C.M. 1109 (DD Form 455).

### (g) Vacation of a suspended summary court-martial sentence.

The person conducting the hearing shall notify the probationer before

 the hearing of the rights specified in subsections (d)(1)(B)(i), (ii), (iii),

and (v) of this rule.

#### (6) Decision.

A commander with authority to vacate the suspension shall review

the record produced by and the recommendation of the person who conducted

the vacation proceeding, decide whether the probationer violated a condition

 of suspension, and, if so, decide whether to vacate the suspended sentence.

 If the officer exercising jurisdiction decides to vacate the suspended

sentence, that officer shall prepare a written statement of the evidence

relied on and the reasons for vacating the suspended sentence.

#### (7) Execution.

Any unexecuted part of a suspended sentence ordered vacated under

 this subsection shall be ordered executed.

## Rule 1110. Waiver or withdrawal of appellate review

### (a) In general.

After any general court-martial, except one in which the approved

 sentence includes death, and after any special court-martial in which the

approved sentence includes a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one

year, the accused may waive or withdraw appellate review.

#### Discussion

Appellate review is not available for special courts-martial in

which a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year was not adjudged

or approved or for summary courts-martial. Cases not subject to appellate

review, or in which appellate review is waived or withdrawn, are reviewed

by a judge advocate under R.C.M. 1112. Such cases may also be submitted to

the Judge Advocate General for review. _See_ R.C.M. 1201(b)(3).

Appellate review is mandatory when the approved sentence includes death.

### (b) Right to counsel.

#### (1) In general.

 under R.C.M. 502(d)(1) before submitting a waiver or withdrawal of appellate

review.

#### (2) Waiver.

##### (A) Counsel who represented the accused at the court-martial.

The accused shall have the right to consult with any civilian,

individual military, or detailed counsel who represented the accused at the

court-martial concerning whether to waive appellate review unless such counsel

has been excused under R.C.M. 505(d)(2)(B).

##### (B) Associate counsel.

If counsel who represented the accused at the court-martial has

not been excused but is not immediately available to consult with the accused,

because of physical separation or other reasons, associate defense counsel

 shall be detailed to the accused upon request by the accused. Such counsel

 shall communicate with counsel who represented the accused at the court-martial,

and shall advise the accused concerning whether to waive appellate review.

##### (C) Substitute counsel.

If counsel who represented the accused at the court-martial has

been excused under R.C.M. 505(d)(2)(B), substitute defense counsel shall

be detailed to advise the accused concerning waiver of appellate rights.

#### (3) Withdrawal.

##### (A) Appellate defense counsel.

If the accused is represented by appellate defense counsel, the

 accused shall have the right to consult with such counsel concerning whether

to withdraw the appeal.

##### (B) Associate defense counsel.

If the accused is represented by appellate defense counsel, and

such counsel is not immediately available to consult with the accused, because

of physical separation or other reasons, associate defense counsel shall

be detailed to the accused, upon request by the accused. Such counsel shall

communicate with appellate defense counsel and shall advise the accused whether

to withdraw the appeal.

##### (C) No counsel.

If appellate defense counsel has not been assigned to the accused,

 defense counsel shall be detailed for the accused. Such counsel shall advise

the accused concerning whether to withdraw the appeal. If practicable, counsel

who represented the accused at the court-martial shall be detailed.

#### (4) Civilian counsel.

Whether or not the accused was represented by civilian counsel at

the court-martial, the accused may consult with civilian counsel, at no

expense to the United States, concerning whether to waive or withdraw appellate

review.

#### (5) Record of trial.

Any defense counsel with whom the accused consults under this rule

 shall be given reasonable opportunity to examine the record of trial.

##### Discussion

Ordinarily counsel may use the accused's copy of the record. If

this is not possible, as when the accused and counsel are physically separated,

another copy should be made available to counsel.

#### (6) Consult.

The right to consult with counsel, as used in this rule, does not

 require communication in the presence of one another.

### (c) Compulsion, coercion, inducement prohibited.

No person may compel, coerce, or induce an accused by force, promises

 of clemency, or otherwise to waive or withdraw appellate review.

### (d) Form of waiver or withdrawal.

A waiver or withdrawal of appellate review shall:

(1) Be written;

(2) State that the accused and defense counsel have discussed the accused's

right to appellate review and the effect of waiver or withdrawal of appellate

review and that the accused understands these matters;

(3) State that the waiver or withdrawal is submitted voluntarily; and

(4) Be signed by the accused and by defense counsel.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 19 (DD Form 2330) or Appendix 20

(DD Form 2331) for samples of forms.

bar review by the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1) and by

the Court of Criminal Appeals. Once submitted, a waiver or withdrawal in

If the accused files a timely waiver of appellate review in accordance

with this rule, the record shall be forwarded for review by a judge advocate

under R.C.M. 1112.

#### (3) Withdrawal.

Action on a withdrawal of appellate review shall be carried out

in accordance with procedures established by the Judge Advocate General,

or if the case is pending before a Court of Criminal Appeals, in accordance

with the rules of such court. If the appeal is withdrawn, the Judge Advocate

General shall forward the record to an appropriate authority for compliance

with R.C.M. 1112.

#### (4) Substantial compliance required.

A purported waiver or withdrawal of an appeal which does not substantially

comply with this rule shall have no effect.

## Rule 1111. Disposition of the record of trial after action

### (a) General courts-martial.

#### (1) Cases forwarded to the Judge Advocate General.

A record of trial by general court-martial and the convening authority's

action shall be sent directly to the Judge Advocate General concerned if

the approved sentence includes death or if the accused has not waived review

under R.C.M. 1110. Unless otherwise prescribed by regulations of the Secretary

concerned, 10 copies of the order promulgating the result of trial as to

each accused shall be forwarded with the original record of trial. Two additional

copies of the record of trial shall accompany the original record if the

 approved sentence includes death or if it includes dismissal of an officer,

 cadet, or midshipman, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or confinement

for one year or more and the accused has not waived appellate review. Forwarding of an authenticated electronic copy of the record of trial satisfies the requirements under this rule.

#### (2) Cases forwarded to a judge advocate.

A record of trial by general court-martial and the convening authority's

action shall be sent directly to a judge advocate for review under R.C.M.

1112 if the sentence does not include death and if the accused has waived

appellate review under R.C.M. 1110. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary

 concerned, 4 copies of the order promulgating the result of trial shall be

 forwarded with the original record of trial.

### (b) Special courts-martial.

#### (1) Cases including an approved bad-conduct discharge or confinement for

one year.

If the approved sentence of a special court-martial includes a

bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year, the record shall be disposed

of as provided in subsection (a) of this rule.

#### (2) Other cases.

The record of trial by a special court-martial in which the approved

 sentence does not include a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one

year shall be forwarded directly to a judge advocate for review under R.C.M.

1112. Four copies of the order promulgating the result of trial shall be

forwarded with the record of trial, unless otherwise prescribed by regulations

of the Secretary concerned.

### (c) Summary courts-martial.

The convening authority shall dispose of a record of trial by summary

 court-martial as provided by R.C.M. 1306.

#### Discussion

 _See_ DD Form 494 (Court-Martial Data Sheet).

## Rule 1112. Review by a judge advocate

### (a) In general.

Except as provided in subsection (b) of this rule, under regulations

 of the Secretary concerned, a judge advocate shall review:

(1) Each general court-martial in which the accused has waived or withdrawn

appellate review under R.C.M. 1110.

not include a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year; and

(3) Each summary court-martial.

### (b) Exception.

If the accused was found not guilty or not guilty only by reason

of lack of mental responsibility of all offenses or if the convening authority

disapproved all findings of guilty, no review under this rule is required.

### (c) Disqualification.

No person may review a case under this rule if that person has acted

 in the same case as an accuser, preliminary hearing officer, member of the court-martial,

military judge, or counsel, or has otherwise acted on behalf of the prosecution

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113 concerning when the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction may order parts of the sentence executed. _

See_ R.C.M. 1114 concerning orders promulgating the action of the

officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction. _See also_

Appendix 16 (Forms for actions) and Appendix 17 (Forms for court-martial

If the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction orders

a rehearing, but the convening authority finds a rehearing impracticable,

the convening authority shall dismiss the charges.

#### (3) Notification.

After the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction

has taken action, the accused shall be notified of the action and the accused

shall be provided with a copy of the judge advocate's review.

### (g) Forwarding following review under this rule.

#### (1) Records forwarded to the Judge Advocate General.

If the judge advocate who reviews the case under this rule states

 that corrective action is required as a matter of law, and the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction does not take action that is at least

as favorable to the accused as that recommended by the judge advocate, the

record of trial and the action thereon shall be forwarded to the Judge Advocate

General concerned for review under R.C.M. 1201(b)(2).

#### (2) Sentence including dismissal.

If the approved sentence includes dismissal, the record shall be

 forwarded to the Secretary concerned.

##### Discussion

A dismissal may not be ordered executed until approved by the Secretary

or the Secretary's designee. _See_ R.C.M. 1206.

#### (3) Other records.

Records reviewed under this rule which are not forwarded under

subsection (g)(1) of this rule shall be disposed of as prescribed by the

Secretary concerned.

##### Discussion

A dismissal may not be ordered executed until approved by the Secretary

or the Secretary's designee under R.C.M. 1206.

## Rule 1113. Execution of sentences

### (a) In general.

No sentence of a court-martial may be executed unless it has been

 approved by the convening authority.

#### Discussion

An order executing the sentence directs that the sentence be carried

 out. Except as provided in subsections (d)(2), (3), and (5) of this rule,

no part of a sentence may be carried out until it is ordered executed.

### (b) Punishments which the convening authority may order executed in the

 initial action.

Except as provided in subsection (c) of this rule, the convening

 authority may order all or part of the sentence of a court-martial executed

 when the convening authority takes initial action under R.C.M. 1107.

### (c) Punishments which the convening authority may not order executed in

the initial action.

#### (1) Dishonorable or a bad-conduct discharge.

Except as may otherwise be prescribed by the Secretary concerned,

a dishonorable or a bad-conduct discharge may be ordered executed only by:

(A) The officer who reviews the case under R.C.M. 1112(f), as part of

the action approving the sentence, except when that action must be forwarded

under R.C.M. 1112(g)(1); or

(B) The officer then exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over

 the accused.

A dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge may be ordered

executed only after a final judgment within the meaning of R.C.M. 1209 has

been rendered in the case. If on the date of final judgment a servicemember

is not on appellate leave and more than 6 months have elapsed since approval

 of the sentence by the convening authority, before a dishonorable or a bad-conduct

discharge may be executed, the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction

over the servicemember shall consider the advice of that officer's staff

judge advocate as to whether retention of the servicemember would be in the

best interest of the service. Such advice shall include the findings and

sentence as finally approved, the nature and character of duty since approval

of the sentence by the convening authority, and a recommendation whether

the discharge should be executed.

#### (2) Dismissal of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman.

Dismissal of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman may be

 approved and ordered executed only by the Secretary concerned or such Under

 Secretary or Assistant Secretary as the Secretary concerned may designate.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1206(a) concerning approval by the

Secretary.

#### (3) Sentences extending to death.

A punishment of death may be ordered executed only by the President.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1207 concerning approval by the President.

### (d) Self-executing punishments.

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge that has been approved by an appropriate convening authority may be self-executing after final judgment at such time as:

(1) The accused has received a sentence of no confinement or has completed all confinement;

(2) The accused has been placed on excess or appellate leave; and,

(3) The appropriate official has certified that the accused's case is final.  Upon completion of the certification, the official shall forward the certification to the accused's personnel office for preparation of a final discharge order and certificate.

### (e) Other considerations concerning the execution of certain sentences.

#### (1) Death.

##### (A) Manner carried out.

A sentence to death which has been finally ordered executed shall

be carried out in the manner prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

##### (B) Action when accused lacks mental capacity.

An accused lacking the mental capacity to understand the punishment

 to be suffered or the reason for imposition of the death sentence may not

be put to death during any period when such incapacity exists. The accused

is presumed to have such mental capacity. If a substantial question is raised

as to whether the accused lacks capacity, the convening authority then exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the accused shall order a hearing

on the question. A military judge, counsel for the government, and counsel

for the accused shall be detailed. The convening authority shall direct an

 examination of the accused in accordance with R.C.M. 706, but the examination

 may be limited to determining whether the accused understands the punishment

to be suffered and the reason therefore. The military judge shall consider

all evidence presented, including evidence provided by the accused. The accused

has the burden of proving such lack of capacity by a preponderance of the

evidence. The military judge shall make findings of fact, which will then

be forwarded to the convening authority ordering the hearing. If the accused

is found to lack capacity, the convening authority shall stay the execution

until the accused regains appropriate capacity.

###### Discussion

A verbatim transcript of the hearing should accompany the findings

of fact.

#### (2) Confinement.

##### (A) Effective date of confinement.

Any period of confinement included in the sentence of a court-martial

 begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial,

but the following shall be excluded in computing the service of the term

of confinement:

(i) Periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or

 deferred;

(ii) Periods during which the accused is in custody of civilian authorities

under Article 14 from the time of the delivery to the return to military

custody, if the accused was convicted in the civilian court;

(iii) Periods during which the accused is in custody of civilian or foreign authorities after the convening authority, pursuant to Article 57a.(b)(1), has postponed the service of a sentence to confinement.

####### Discussion

The convening authority's decision to postpone service of a court-martial

sentence to confinement normally should be reflected in the action.

(iv) Periods during which the accused has escaped or is absent without

 authority, or is absent under a parole which proper authority has later

revoked, or is erroneously released from confinement through misrepresentation

or fraud on the part of the prisoner, or is erroneously released from confinement

upon the prisoner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus under a court order

which is later reversed; and

(v) Periods during which another sentence by court-martial to confinement

 is being served. When a prisoner serving a court-martial sentence to confinement

is later convicted by a court-martial of another offense and sentenced to

confinement, the later sentence interrupts the running of the earlier sentence.

Any unremitted remaining portion of the earlier sentence will be served after

the later sentence is fully executed.

##### (B) Nature of the confinement.

The omission of "hard labor" from any sentence of a

 court-martial which has adjudged confinement shall not prohibit the authority

who orders the sentence executed from requiring hard labor as part of the

punishment.

##### (C) Place of confinement.

The authority who orders a sentence to confinement into execution

 shall designate the place of confinement under regulations prescribed by

the Secretary concerned, unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

 Under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, a sentence

to confinement adjudged by a court-martial or other military tribunal, regardless

whether the sentence includes a punitive discharge or dismissal and regardless

whether the punitive discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be ordered

to be served in any place of confinement under the control of any of the

armed forces or in any penal or correctional institution under the control

of the United States or which the United States may be allowed to use. Persons

 so confined in a penal or correctional institution not under the control

of one of the armed forces are subject to the same discipline and treatment

as persons confined or committed by the courts of the United States or of

the State, Territory, District of Columbia, or place in which the institution

is situated. When the service of a sentence to confinement has been deferred

and the deferment is later rescinded, the convening authority shall designate

the place of confinement in the initial action on the sentence or in the

order rescinding the deferment. No member of the armed forces, or person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, may be placed in confinement in immediate association with enemy prisoners or with other foreign nationals not subject to the code.  The Secretary concerned may prescribe regulations governing the place and conditions of confinement.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1101(c) concerning deferment of a sentence

to confinement.

#### (3) Confinement in lieu of fine.

Confinement may not be executed for failure to pay a fine if the

 accused demonstrates that the accused has made good faith efforts to pay

but cannot because of indigency, unless the authority considering imposition

of confinement determines, after giving the accused notice and opportunity

to be heard, that there is no other punishment adequate to meet the Government's

interest in appropriate punishment.

#### (4) Restriction; hard labor without confinement.

When restriction and hard labor without confinement are included

in the same sentence, they shall, unless one is suspended, be executed concurrently.

#### (5) More than one sentence.

If at the time forfeitures may be ordered executed, the accused

is already serving a sentence to forfeitures by another court-martial, the

authority taking action may order that the later forfeitures will be executed

when the earlier sentence to forfeitures is completed.

## Rule 1114. Promulgating orders

### (a) In general.

#### (1) Scope of rule.

Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, orders

promulgating the result of trial and the actions of the convening or higher

authorities on the record shall be prepared, issued, and distributed as

prescribed in this rule.

#### (2) Purpose.

A promulgating order publishes the result of the court-martial and

 the convening authority's action and any later action taken on the case.

#### (3) Summary courts-martial.

An order promulgating the result of a trial by summary court-martial

 need not be issued.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1306(b)(2) concerning summary courts-martial.

#### (4) Self-executing final orders.

An order promulgating a self-executing dishonorable or bad conduct discharge need not be issued.  The original action by a convening authority approving a discharge and certification by the appropriate official that the case is final may be forwarded to the accused's personnel office for preparation of a discharge order and certificate.

### (b) By whom issued.

#### (1) Initial orders.

The order promulgating the result of trial and the initial action

of the convening authority shall be issued by the convening authority.

#### (2) Orders issued after the initial action.

Any action taken on the case subsequent to the initial action shall

 be promulgated in supplementary orders. The subsequent action and the supplementary

order may be the same document if signed personally by the appropriate convening

or higher authority.

##### (A) When the President or the Secretary concerned has taken final action.

General court-martial orders publishing the final result in cases

in which the President or the Secretary concerned has taken final action

shall be promulgated as prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned.

##### (B) Other cases.

In cases other than those in subsection (b)(2)(A) of this rule,

the final action may be promulgated by an appropriate convening authority.

### (c) Contents.

#### (1) In general.

The order promulgating the initial action shall set forth: the type

 of court-martial and the command by which it was convened; the charges and

specifications, or a summary thereof, on which the accused was arraigned;

the accused's pleas; the findings or other disposition of each charge and

specification; the sentence, if any; and the action of the convening authority,

or a summary thereof. Supplementary orders shall recite, verbatim, the action

or order of the appropriate authority, or a summary thereof.

#### (2) Dates.

A promulgating order shall bear the date of the initial action,

if any, of the convening authority. An order promulgating an acquittal,

a court-martial terminated before findings, a court-martial resulting in

a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility of

 all charges and specifications, or action on the findings or sentence taken

after the initial action of the convening authority shall bear the date

of its publication. A promulgating order shall state the date the sentence

was adjudged, the date on which the acquittal was announced, or the date

on which the proceedings were otherwise terminated.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 17 for sample forms for promulgating

 orders.

#### (3) Order promulgated regardless of the result of trial or nature of the

 action.

An order promulgating the result of trial by general or special

 court-martial shall be issued regardless of the result and regardless of

the action of the convening or higher authorities.

### (d) Orders containing classified information.

When an order contains information which must be classified, only

the order retained in the unit files and those copies which accompany the

record of trial shall be complete and contain the classified information.

The order shall be assigned the appropriate security classification. Asterisks

shall be substituted for the classified information in the other copies of

the order.

### (e) Authentication.

The promulgating order shall be authenticated by the signature of

the convening or other competent authority acting on the case, or a person

acting under the direction of such authority. A promulgating order prepared

in compliance with this rule shall be presumed authentic.

### (f) Distribution.

Promulgating orders shall be distributed as provided in regulations

 of the Secretary concerned.

# CHAPTER XII. APPEALS AND REVIEW

## Rule 1201. Action by the Judge Advocate General

### (a) Cases required to be referred to a Court of Criminal Appeals.

The Judge Advocate General shall refer to a Court of Criminal Appeals

 the record in each trial by court-martial:

(1) In which the sentence, as approved, extends to death; or

(2) In which-

(A) The sentence, as approved, extends to dismissal of a commissioned

 officer, cadet, or midshipman, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or

confinement for 1 year or longer; and

(B) The accused has not waived or withdrawn appellate review.

###### Discussion

_ See_ R.C.M. 1110 concerning waiver or withdrawal

of appellate review.

  _See_ also subsection

(b)(1) of this rule concerning cases reviewed by the Judge Advocate General

which may be referred to a Court of Criminal Appeals.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1203 concerning review by the Court of Criminal Appeals

and the powers and responsibilities of the Judge Advocate General after such

review. _See_ R.C.M. 1202 concerning appellate counsel.

### (b) Cases reviewed by the Judge Advocate General.

#### (1) Mandatory examination of certain general courts-martial.

Except when the accused has waived the right to appellate review

or withdrawn such review, the record of trial by a general court-martial

in which there has been a finding of guilty and a sentence, the appellate

 review of which is not provided for in subsection (a) of this rule, shall

be examined in the office of the Judge Advocate General. If any part of

the findings or sentence is found unsupported in law, or if reassessment

 of the sentence is appropriate, the Judge Advocate General may modify or

set aside the findings or sentence or both. If the Judge Advocate General

so directs, the record shall be reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals

in accordance with R.C.M. 1203. If the case is forwarded to a Court of Criminal

Appeals, the accused shall be informed and shall have the rights under R.C.M.

1202(b)(2).

##### Discussion

A case forwarded to a Court of Criminal Appeals under this subsection

 is subject to review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces upon petition

by the accused under Article 67(a)(3) or when certified by the Judge Advocate

General under Article 67(a)(2).

#### (2) Mandatory review of cases forwarded under R.C.M. 1112(g)(1).

The Judge Advocate General shall review each case forwarded under

 R.C.M. 1112(g)(1). On such review, the Judge Advocate General may vacate

or modify, in whole or part, the findings or sentence, or both, of a court-martial

on the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court-martial,

lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to

the substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the sentence.

#### (3) Review by the Judge Advocate General after final review.

##### (A) In general.

Notwithstanding R.C.M. 1209, the Judge Advocate General may,_

 sua sponte_ or upon application of the accused or a person with

authority to act for the accused, vacate or modify, in whole or in part,

the findings, sentence, or both of a court-martial which has been finally

reviewed, but has not been reviewed either by a Court of Criminal Appeals

or by the Judge Advocate General under subsection (b)(1) of this rule, on

the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court-martial, lack

of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to the

 substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the sentence.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1210 concerning petition for new trial.

 Review of a case by a Judge Advocate General under this subsection is not

part of appellate review within the meaning of Article 76 or R.C.M. 1209.

  Review

of a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility

under this rule may not extend to the determination of lack of mental responsibility.

 Thus, modification of a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental

 responsibility under this rule is limited to changing the finding to not

guilty or not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility of a

 lesser included offense.

##### (B) Procedure.

Each Judge Advocate General shall provide procedures for considering

 all cases properly submitted under subsection (b)(3) of this rule and may

 prescribe the manner by which an application for relief under subsection

(b)(3) of this rule may be made and, if submitted by a person other than

the accused, may require that the applicant show authority to act on behalf

of the accused.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1114 concerning orders promulgating

 action under this rule.

##### (C) Time limits on applications.

Any application for review by the Judge Advocate General under

Article 69 must be made on or before the last day of the two year period

beginning on the date the sentence is approved by the convening authority

or the date the findings are announced for cases which do not proceed to

 sentencing, unless the accused establishes good cause for failure to file

 within that time.

#### (4) Rehearing.

If the Judge Advocate General sets aside the findings or sentence,

 the Judge Advocate General may, except when the setting aside is based on

lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order

a rehearing. If the Judge Advocate General sets aside the findings and sentence

and does not order a rehearing, the Judge Advocate General shall order that

the charges be dismissed. If the Judge Advocate General orders a rehearing

but the convening authority finds a rehearing impractical, the convening

authority shall dismiss the charges.

### (c) Remission and suspension.

The Judge Advocate General may, when so authorized by the Secretary

 concerned under Article 74, at any time remit or suspend the unexecuted part

of any sentence, other than a sentence approved by the President.

## Rule 1202. Appellate counsel

### (a) In general.

The Judge Advocate General concerned shall detail one or more commissioned

officers as appellate Government counsel and one or more commissioned officers

as appellate defense counsel who are qualified under Article 27(b)(1).

### (b) Duties.

#### (1) Appellate Government counsel.

Appellate Government counsel shall represent the United States before

 the Court of Criminal Appeals or the United States Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces when directed to do so by the Judge Advocate General concerned.

Appellate Government counsel may represent the United States before the United

States Supreme Court when requested to do so by the Attorney General.

#### (2) Appellate defense counsel.

Appellate defense counsel shall represent the accused before the

 Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or

the Supreme Court when the accused is a party in the case before such court

and:

(A) The accused requests to be represented by appellate defense counsel;

(B) The United States is represented by counsel; or

(C) The Judge Advocate General has sent the case to the United States

 Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Appellate defense counsel is authorized

to communicate directly with the accused. The accused is a party in the

case when named as a party in pleadings before the court or, even if not

so named, when the military judge is named as respondent in a petition by

the Government for extraordinary relief from a ruling in favor of the accused

at trial.

###### Discussion

For a discussion of the duties of the trial defense counsel concerning

post-trial and appellate matters, _see_ R.C.M. 502(d)(6) Discussion

(E). Appellate defense counsel may communicate with trial defense counsel

concerning the case. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 502 (privileges).

  If

all or part of the findings and sentence are affirmed by the Court of Criminal

Appeals, appellate defense counsel should advise the accused whether the

accused should petition for further review in the United States Court of

Appeals for the Armed Forces and concerning which issues should be raised.

  The

accused may be represented by civilian counsel before the Court of Criminal

Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and the Supreme Court.

Such counsel will not be provided at the expense of the United States. Civilian

counsel may represent the accused before these courts in addition to or

instead of military counsel.

  If, after any decision of the

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the accused may apply for a writ

of certiorari (_see_ R.C.M. 1205), appellate defense counsel

should advise the accused whether to apply for review by the Supreme Court

and which issues might be raised. If authorized to do so by the accused,

appellate defense counsel may prepare and file a petition for a writ of certiorari

on behalf of the accused.

  The accused has no right to select

appellate defense counsel. Under some circumstances, however, the accused

may be entitled to request that the detailed appellate defense counsel be

replaced by another appellate defense counsel.

  _

See also_ R.C.M. 1204(b)(1) concerning detailing counsel with respect

to the right to petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review.

## Rule 1203. Review by a Court of Criminal Appeals

### (a) In general.

Each Judge Advocate General shall establish a Court of Criminal

 Appeals composed of appellate military judges.

#### Discussion

 _See_ Article 66 concerning the composition of the

Courts of Criminal Appeals, the qualifications of appellate military judges,

the grounds for their ineligibility, and restrictions upon the official

relationship of the members of the court to other members. Uniform rules

of court for the Courts of Criminal Appeals are prescribed by the Judge Advocates

General.

### (b) Cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals.

A Court of Criminal Appeals shall review cases referred to it by

the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(a) or (b)(1).

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1110 concerning withdrawal of a case

pending before a Court of Criminal Appeals.

  _See

_ R.C.M. 908 concerning procedures for interlocutory appeals by the

Government.

  In cases referred to it under R.C.M. 1201, a

Court of Criminal Appeals may act only with respect to the findings and

sentence as approved by proper authority. It may affirm only such findings

 of guilty or such part of a finding of guilty as includes an included offense,

 as it finds correct in law and fact and determines on the basis of the entire

record should be approved. A Court of Criminal Appeals has generally the

same powers as the convening authority to modify a sentence (_see

_ R.C.M. 1107), but it may not suspend all or part of a sentence.

However, it may reduce the period of a suspension prescribed by a convening

authority. It may not defer service of a sentence to confinement. (_

see_ R.C.M. 1101(c)). It may, however, review a decision by a convening

authority concerning deferral, to determine whether that decision was an

abuse of the convening authority's discretion.

  In considering

the record of a case referred to it under R.C.M. 1201, a Court of Criminal

 Appeals may weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and

determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the court-martial

saw and heard the evidence. A finding or sentence of a court-martial may

not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially

prejudices the substantial rights of the accused. Article 59(a).

  If

a Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside any findings of guilty or the sentence,

it may, except as to findings set aside for lack of sufficient evidence in

the record to support the findings, order an appropriate type of rehearing

or reassess the sentence as appropriate. _See_ R.C.M. 810

 concerning rehearings. If the Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside all the

 findings and the sentence and does not order a rehearing, it must order

the charges dismissed. _ See_ Articles 59(a) and 66.

  A

Court of Criminal Appeals may on petition for extraordinary relief issue

all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction and agreeable

to the usages and principles of law. Any party may petition a Court of Criminal

Appeals for extraordinary relief.

### (c) Action on cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals.

#### (1) Forwarding by the Judge Advocate General to the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces.

The Judge Advocate General may forward the decision of the Court

of Criminal Appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review

with respect to any matter of law. In such a case, the Judge Advocate General

shall cause a copy of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals and the

order forwarding the case to be served on the accused and on appellate defense

counsel. While a review of a forwarded case is pending, the Secretary concerned

may defer further service of a sentence to confinement that has been ordered

executed in such a case.

#### (2) Action when sentence is set aside.

In a case reviewed by it under this rule in which the Court of

Criminal Appeals has set aside the sentence and which is not forwarded to

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces under subsection (c)(1) of this

rule, the Judge Advocate General shall instruct an appropriate convening

authority to take action in accordance with the decision of the Court of

Criminal Appeals. If the Court of Criminal Appeals has ordered a rehearing,

the record shall be sent to an appropriate convening authority. If that convening

authority finds a rehearing impracticable that convening authority may dismiss

the charges.

##### Discussion

If charges are dismissed, _see_ R.C.M. 1208 concerning

 restoration of rights, privileges, and property. _See_ R.C.M.

1114 concerning promulgating orders.

#### (3) Action when sentence is affirmed in whole or part.

##### (A) Sentence requiring approval by the President.

If the Court of Criminal Appeals affirms any sentence which includes

 death, the Judge Advocate General shall transmit the record of trial and

the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals directly to the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces when any period for reconsideration provided by the

rules of the Courts of Criminal Appeals has expired.

##### (B) Other cases.

If the Court of Criminal Appeals affirms any sentence other than

one which includes death, the Judge Advocate General shall cause a copy

of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals to be served on the accused

in accordance with subsection (d) of this rule.

#### (4) Remission or suspension.

If the Judge Advocate General believes that a sentence as affirmed

by the Court of Criminal Appeals, other than one which includes death, should

be remitted or suspended in whole or part, the Judge Advocate General may,

before taking action under subsections (c)(1) or (3) of this rule, transmit

the record of trial and the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals to

the secretary concerned with a recommendation for action under Article 74

or may take such action as may be authorized by the Secretary concerned under

Article 74(a).

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1201(c); 1206.

#### (5) Action when accused lacks mental capacity.

An appellate authority may not affirm the proceedings while the

 accused lacks mental capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate

intelligently in the appellate proceedings. In the absence of substantial

 evidence to the contrary, the accused is presumed to have the capacity to

 understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the appellate proceedings.

If a substantial question is raised as to the requisite mental capacity

of the accused, the appellate authority may direct that the record be forwarded

to an appropriate authority for an examination of the accused in accordance

with R.C.M. 706, but the examination may be limited to determining the accused's

present capacity to understand and cooperate in the appellate proceedings.

The order of the appellate authority will instruct the appropriate authority

as to permissible actions that may be taken to dispose of the matter. If

the record is thereafter returned to the appellate authority, the appellate

authority may affirm part or all of the findings or sentence unless it is

established, by a preponderance of the evidence-including matters

outside the record of trial-that the accused does not have the requisite

 mental capacity. If the accused does not have the requisite mental capacity,

 the appellate authority shall stay the proceedings until the accused regains

appropriate capacity, or take other appropriate action. Nothing in this

subsection shall prohibit the appellate authority from making a determination

in favor of the accused which will result in the setting aside of a conviction.

### (d) Notification to accused.

#### (1) Notification of decision.

The accused shall be notified of the decision of the Court of Criminal

Appeals in accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

##### Discussion

The accused may be notified personally, or a copy of the decision

may be sent, after service on appellate counsel of record, if any, by first

class certified mail to the accused at an address provided by the accused

or, if no such address has been provided by the accused, at the latest address

listed for the accused in the accused's official service record.

  If

the Judge Advocate General has forwarded the case to the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces, the accused should be so notified. _See_

subsection (c)(1) of this rule.

#### (2) Notification of right to petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed

 Forces for review.

If the accused has the right to petition the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces for review, the accused shall be provided with a copy of

the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals bearing an endorsement notifying

the accused of this right. The endorsement shall inform the accused that

such a petition:

(A) May be filed only within 60 days from the time the accused was in

 fact notified of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals or the mailed

copy of the decision was postmarked, whichever is earlier; and

(B) May be forwarded through the officer immediately exercising general

 court-martial jurisdiction over the accused and through the appropriate

Judge Advocate General or filed directly with the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Article 67(c).

  _

See also_ R.C.M. 1204(b).

  The accused may petition

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review, as to any matter of

law, of any decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals except: (1) a case

which was referred to the Court of Criminal Appeals by the Judge Advocate

General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1); (2) a case in which the Court of Criminal

Appeals has set aside the sentence; and (3) a case in which the sentence

includes death (because review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

is mandatory).

  The placing of a petition for review in proper

military channels divests the Court of Criminal Appeals of jurisdiction

over the case, and jurisdiction is thereby conferred on the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces. _See_ R.C.M. 1113 concerning action

to be taken if the accused does not file or the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces denies a petition for review.

#### (3) Receipt by the accused-disposition.

When the accused has the right to petition the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces for review, the receipt of the accused for the copy

of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals, a certificate of service

on the accused, or the postal receipt for delivery of certified mail shall

be transmitted in duplicate by expeditious means to the appropriate Judge

Advocate General. If the accused is personally served, the receipt or certificate

of service shall show the date of service. The Judge Advocate General shall

forward one copy of the receipt, certificate, or postal receipt to the clerk

of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces when required by the court.

### (e) Cases not reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

If the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals is not subject

to review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or if the Judge

Advocate General has not forwarded the case to the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces and the accused has not filed or the Court of Appeals for

 the Armed Forces has denied a petition for review, the Judge Advocate General

shall-

(1) If the sentence affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals includes

a dismissal, transmit the record, the decision of the Court of Criminal

Appeals, and the Judge Advocate General's recommendation to the Secretary

concerned for action under R.C.M. 1206; or

(2) If the sentence affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals does not

 include a dismissal, notify the convening authority, the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the accused, or the Secretary concerned,

 as appropriate, who, subject to R.C.M. 1113(c)(1), may order into execution

 any unexecuted sentence affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals or take

other action, as authorized.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113, 1206, and Article 74(a) concerning

the authority of the Secretary and others to take action.

### (f) Scope.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this rule, this rule does

 not apply to appeals by the Government under R.C.M. 908.

## Rule 1204. Review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

### (a) Cases reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

Under such rules as it may prescribe, the Court of Appeals for the

 Armed Forces shall review the record in all cases:

 extends to death;

(2) Reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals which the Judge Advocate

 General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review;

and

(3) Reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals, except those referred to

it by the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1), in which, upon

petition by the accused and on good cause shown, the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces has granted a review.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Article 67(a) concerning the composition of

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. In any case reviewed by it, the

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may act only with respect to the findings

and sentence as approved by the convening authority and as affirmed or set

aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal Appeals. _See_ Article

67(d) and (e). The rules of practice and procedure before the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces are published in the Military Justice Reporter.

  The

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may entertain petitions for extraordinary

relief and may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction

 and agreeable to the usages and principles of law. Any party may petition

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for extraordinary relief. However,

in the interest of judicial economy, such petitions usually should be filed

with and adjudicated before the appropriate Court of Criminal Appeals prior

to submission to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

### (b) Petition by the accused for review by the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces.

#### (1) Counsel.

When the accused is notified of the right to forward a petition

for review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, if requested by

the accused, associate counsel qualified under R.C.M. 502(d)(1) shall be

detailed to advise and assist the accused in connection with preparing a

petition for further appellate review.

##### Discussion

If reasonably available, the counsel who conducted the defense at

 trial may perform these duties. The counsel detailed to represent the accused

should communicate with the appellate defense counsel representing the accused. _

See_ R.C.M. 1202.

#### (2) Forwarding petition.

The accused shall file any petition for review by the Court of

Appeals for the Armed Forces under subsection (a)(3) of this rule directly

with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Article 67(c) and R.C.M. 1203(d)(2) concerning

notifying the accused of the right to petition the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces for review and the time limits for submitting a petition. _

See also_ the rules of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

concerning when the time for filing a petition begins to run and when a petition

is now timely.

### (c) Action on decision by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

#### (1) In general.

After it has acted on a case, the Court of Appeals for the Armed

 Forces may direct the Judge Advocate General to return the record to the

Court of Criminal Appeals for further proceedings in accordance with the

decision of the court. Otherwise, unless the decision is subject to review

 by the Supreme Court, or there is to be further action by the President

or the Secretary concerned, the Judge Advocate General shall instruct the

convening authority to take action in accordance with that decision. If the

Court has ordered a rehearing, but the convening authority to whom the record

is transmitted finds a rehearing impracticable, the convening authority

may dismiss the charges.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1114 concerning final orders in the

case. _ See also_ R.C.M. 1206 and Article 74(a).

#### (2) Sentence requiring approval of the President.

(A) If the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has affirmed a sentence that must be approved by the President before it may be executed, the Judge Advocate General shall transmit the record of trial, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals, the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and the recommendation of the Judge Advocate General to the Secretary concerned.

(B) If the Secretary concerned is the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary concerned shall forward the material received under paragraph (A) to the Secretary of Defense, together with the recommendation of the Secretary concerned.  The Secretary of Defense shall forward the material, with the recommendation of the Secretary concerned and the recommendation of the Secretary of Defense, to the President for the action of the President.

######## Discussion

 _See_ Article 71(a) and R.C.M. 1207.

#### (3) Sentence requiring approval of the Secretary concerned.

If the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has affirmed a sentence

 which requires approval of the Secretary concerned before it may be executed,

the Judge Advocate General shall follow the procedure in R.C.M. 1203(e)(1).

##### Discussion

 _See_ Article 71(b) and R.C.M. 1206.

#### (4) Decision subject to review by the Supreme Court.

If the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is

 subject to review by the Supreme Court, the Judge Advocate General shall

take no action under subsections (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this rule until:

(A) the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme

Court has expired; or (B) the Supreme Court has denied any petitions for

writ of certiorari filed in the case. After (A) or (B) has occurred, the

Judge Advocate General shall take action under subsection (c)(1), (2), or

(3). If the Supreme Court grants a writ of certiorari, the Judge Advocate

General shall take action under R.C.M. 1205(b).

## Rule 1205. Review by the Supreme Court

### (a) Cases subject to review by the Supreme Court.

Under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1259 and Article 67(h), decisions of the

(3) of this rule in which the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces granted

relief.

 The Supreme Court may not review by writ of certiorari

any action of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in refusing to grant

a petition for review.

### (b) Action by the Supreme Court.

After the Supreme Court has taken action, other than denial of a

 petition for writ of certiorari, in any case, the Judge Advocate General

shall, unless the case is returned to the Court of Appeals for the Armed

Forces for further proceedings, forward the case to the President or the

Secretary concerned in accordance with R.C.M. 1204(c)(2) or (3) when appropriate,

or instruct the convening authority to take action in accordance with the

decision.

## Rule 1206. Powers and responsibilities of the Secretary

### (b) Remission and suspension.

#### (1) In general.

The Secretary concerned and, when designated by the Secretary concerned,

any Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Judge Advocate General, or commander

including all uncollected forfeitures, other than a sentence approved by

the President.

#### (2) Substitution of discharge.

The Secretary concerned may, for good cause, substitute an administrative

discharge for a discharge or dismissal executed in accordance with the sentence

of a court-martial.

#### (3) Sentence commuted by the President.

When the President has commuted a death sentence to a lesser punishment,

the Secretary concerned may remit or suspend any remaining part or amount

of the unexecuted portion of the sentence of a person convicted by a military

tribunal under the Secretary's jurisdiction.

## Rule 1207. Sentences requiring approval by the President

No part of a court-martial sentence extending to death may be executed

until approved by the President.

### Discussion

 _See_ Article 71(a). _See also_ R.C.M.

1203 and 1204 concerning review by the Court of Criminal Appeals and Court

of Appeals for the Armed Forces in capital cases.

## Rule 1208. Restoration

### (a) New trial.

All rights, privileges, and property affected by an executed portion

 of a court-martial sentence-except an executed dismissal or discharge-which

has not again been adjudged upon a new trial or which, after the new trial,

has not been sustained upon the action of any reviewing authority, shall

be restored. So much of the findings and so much of the sentence adjudged

at the earlier trial shall be set aside as may be required by the findings

and sentence at the new trial. Ordinarily, action taken under this subsection

shall be announced in the court-martial order promulgating the final results

 of the proceedings.

####### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1201, 1203, 1204, and 1205 concerning

 cases subject to review by a Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces, and the Supreme Court. _See also_ R.C.M.

1110.

(2) In cases not reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals-

(A) The findings and sentence have been found legally sufficient by

a judge advocate and, when action by such officer is required, have been

approved by the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over

the accused at the time the court-martial was convened (or that officer's

 successor); or

(B) The findings and sentence have been affirmed by the Judge Advocate

 General when review by the Judge Advocate General is required under R.C.M.

 1112(g)(1) or 1201(b)(1).

### (b) Effect of finality.

The appellate review of records of trial provided by the code, the

 proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed,

 or affirmed as required by the code, and all dismissals and discharges carried

into execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval, review,

or affirmation as required by the code, are final and conclusive. Orders

publishing the proceedings of courts-martial and all action taken pursuant

to those proceedings are binding upon all departments, courts, agencies,

and officers of the United States, subject only to action upon a petition

for a new trial under Article 73, to action by the Judge Advocate General

under Article 69(b), to action by the Secretary concerned as provided in

Article 74, and the authority of the President.

## Rule 1210. New trial

### (a) In general.

At any time within 2 years after approval by the convening authority

 of a court-martial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge Advocate

 General for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence or fraud

on the court-martial. A petition may not be submitted after the death of

the accused. A petition for a new trial of the facts may not be submitted

 on the basis of newly discovered evidence when the petitioner was found

guilty of the relevant offense pursuant to a guilty plea.

### (b) Who may petition.

A petition for a new trial may be submitted by the accused personally,

or by accused's counsel, regardless whether the accused has been separated

from the service.

### (c) Form of petition.

A petition for a new trial shall be written and shall be signed

under oath or affirmation by the accused, by a person possessing the power

of attorney of the accused for that purpose, or by a person with the authorization

of an appropriate court to sign the petition as the representative of the

accused. The petition shall contain the following information, or an explanation

why such matters are not included:

(1) The name, service number, and current address of the accused;

(2) The date and location of the trial;

(3) The type of court-martial and the title or position of the convening

 authority;

(4) The request for the new trial;

(5) The sentence or a description thereof as approved or affirmed, with

 any later reduction thereof by clemency or otherwise;

(6) A brief description of any finding or sentence believed to be unjust;

(7) A full statement of the newly discovered evidence or fraud on the

 court-martial which is relied upon for the remedy sought;

(8) Affidavits pertinent to the matters in subsection (c)(6) of this

 rule; and

(9) The affidavit of each person whom the accused expects to present

as a witness in the event of a new trial. Each such affidavit should set

forth briefly the relevant facts within the personal knowledge of the witness.

### (d) Effect of petition.

The submission of a petition for a new trial does not stay the

execution of a sentence.

### (e) Who may act on petition.

If the accused's case is pending before a Court of Criminal Appeals

 or the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the Judge Advocate General

shall refer the petition to the appropriate court for action. Otherwise,

the Judge Advocate General of the armed force which reviewed the previous

trial shall act on the petition, except that petitions submitted by persons

who, at the time of trial and sentence from which the petitioner seeks relief,

were members of the Coast Guard, and who, and who were members of the Coast

Guard at the time the petition is submitted, shall be acted on in the Department

in which the Coast Guard is serving at the time the petition is so submitted.

### (f) Grounds for new trial.

#### (1) In general.

A new trial may be granted only on grounds of newly discovered

evidence or fraud on the court-martial.

#### (2) Newly discovered evidence.

A new trial shall not be granted on the grounds of newly discovered

 evidence unless the petition shows that:

(A) The evidence was discovered after the trial;

(B) The evidence is not such that it would have been discovered by the

 petitioner at the time of trial in the exercise of due diligence; and

(C) The newly discovered evidence, if considered by a court-martial

in the light of all other pertinent evidence, would probably produce a substantially

more favorable result for the accused.

#### (3) Fraud on court-martial.

No fraud on the court-martial warrants a new trial unless it had

a substantial contributing effect on a finding of guilty or the sentence

 adjudged.

##### Discussion

Examples of fraud on a court-martial which may warrant granting

a new trial are: confessed or proved perjury in testimony or forgery of documentary

 evidence which clearly had a substantial contributing effect on a finding

of guilty and without which there probably would not have been a finding

of guilty of the offense; willful concealment by the prosecution from the

defense of evidence favorable to the defense which, if presented to the court-martial,

 would probably have resulted in a finding of not guilty; and willful concealment

of a material ground for challenge of the military judge or any member or

of the disqualification of counsel or the convening authority, when the basis

for challenge or disqualification was not known to the defense at the time

of trial (_see_ R.C.M. 912).

### (g) Action on the petition.

#### (1) In general.

The authority considering the petition may cause such additional

 investigation to be made and such additional information to be secured as

that authority believes appropriate. Upon written request, and in its discretion,

the authority considering the petition may permit oral argument on the matter.

#### (2) Courts of Criminal Appeals; Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

The Courts of Criminal Appeals and the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces shall act on a petition for a new trial in accordance with their

 respective rules.

#### (3) The Judge Advocates General.

When a petition is considered by the Judge Advocate General, any

 hearing may be before the Judge Advocate General or before an officer or

officers designated by the Judge Advocate General. If the Judge Advocate

 General believes meritorious grounds for relief under Article 74 have been

 established but that a new trial is not appropriate, the Judge Advocate

General may act under Article 74 if authorized to do so, or transmit the

petition and related papers to the Secretary concerned with a recommendation.

The Judge Advocate General may also, in cases which have been finally reviewed

but have not been reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals, act under Article

69.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1201(b)(3).

### (h) Action when new trial is granted.

#### (1) Forwarding to convening authority.

When a petition for a new trial is granted, the Judge Advocate

General shall select and forward the case to a convening authority for disposition.

#### (2) Charges at new trial.

At a new trial, the accused may not be tried for any offense of

which the accused was found not guilty or upon which the accused was not

tried at the earlier court-martial.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 810 concerning additional special

rules which apply at a new trial. In other respects a new trial is conducted

like any other court-martial.

#### (3) Action by convening authority.

The convening authority's action on the record of a new trial is

the same as in other courts-martial.

#### (4) Disposition of record.

The disposition of the record of a new trial is the same as for

other courts-martial.

#### (5) Court-martial orders.

Court-martial orders promulgating the final action taken as a result

 of a new trial, including any restoration of rights, privileges, and property,

shall be promulgated in accordance with R.C.M. 1114.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Article 75 and R.C.M. 1208 concerning restoration

of rights when the executed portion of a sentence is not sustained in a

new trial or action following it.

#### (6) Action by persons charged with execution of the sentence.

Persons charged with the administrative duty of executing a sentence

 adjudged upon a new trial after it has been ordered executed shall credit

the accused with any executed portion or amount of the original sentence

included in the new sentence in computing the term or amount of punishment

actually to be executed pursuant to the sentence.

# CHAPTER XIII. SUMMARY COURTS-MARTIAL

## Rule 1301. Summary courts-martial generally

### (a) Composition.

A summary court-martial is composed of one commissioned officer

on active duty. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned a

summary court-martial shall be of the same armed force as the accused. Summary courts-martial shall be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the military service to which the accused belongs. Whenever practicable, a summary court-martial should be an officer whose grade is

not below lieutenant of the Navy or Coast Guard or captain of the Army,

Air Force, or Marine Corps. When only one commissioned officer is present

 with a command or detachment, that officer shall be the summary court-martial

 of that command or detachment. When more than one commissioned officer is

present with a command or detachment, the convening authority may not be

the summary court-martial of that command or detachment.

### (b) Function.

The function of the summary court-martial is to promptly adjudicate

 minor offenses under a simple procedure. The summary court-martial shall

thoroughly and impartially inquire into both sides of the matter and shall

ensure that the interests of both the Government and the accused are safeguarded

and that justice is done. A summary court-martial may seek advice from a

judge advocate or legal officer on questions of law, but the summary court-martial

may not seek advice from any person on factual conclusions which should be

drawn from evidence or the sentence which should be imposed, as the summary

 court-martial has the independent duty to make these determinations.

#### Discussion

For a definition of "minor offenses," _see_

paragraph 1e, Part V.

### (c) Jurisdiction.

**[Note: R.C.M. 1301(c) applies to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.]**

(1) Subject to Chapter II, summary courts-martial have the power to

try persons subject to the code, except commissioned officers, warrant officers,

cadets, aviation cadets, and midshipmen, for any noncapital offense made

punishable by the code.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1) above, summary courts-martial do not have jurisdiction over offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), 120b(b), forcible sodomy under Article 125, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ. Such offenses shall not be referred to a summary court-martial.

##### Discussion

 Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, only a general court-martial has jurisdiction to try penetrative sex offenses under subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120, subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120b, Article 125, and attempts to commit such penetrative sex offenses under Article 80, UCMJ.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 103(3) for a definition of capital

 offenses.

### (d) Punishments.

#### (1) Limitations-amount.

Subject to R.C.M. 1003, summary courts-martial may adjudge any

punishment not forbidden by the code except death, dismissal, dishonorable

or bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than 1 month, hard labor

without confinement for more than 45 days, restriction to specified limits

for more than 2 months, or forfeiture of more than two-thirds of 1 month's

pay.

##### Discussion

The maximum penalty which can be adjudged in a summary court-martial

 is confinement for 30 days, forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for one

month, and reduction to the lowest pay grade. _See_ subsection

(2) below for additional limits on enlisted persons serving in pay grades

above the fourth enlisted pay grade.

  A summary court-martial

may not suspend all or part of a sentence, although the summary court-martial

may recommend to the convening authority that all or part of a sentence be

suspended. If a sentence includes both reduction in grade and forfeitures,

the maximum forfeiture is calculated at the reduced pay grade. _See

also_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning other punishments which may be adjudged,

the effects of certain types of punishment, and combination of certain types

of punishment. The summary court-martial should ascertain the effect of

Article 58a in that armed force.

#### (2) Limitations-pay grade.

In the case of enlisted members above the fourth enlisted pay grade,

 summary courts-martial may not adjudge confinement, hard labor without confinement,

or reduction except to the next pay grade.

##### Discussion

The provisions of this subsection apply to an accused in the fifth

 enlisted pay grade who is reduced to the fourth enlisted pay grade by the

summary court-martial.

### (e) Counsel.

The accused at a summary court-martial does not have the right to

 counsel. If the accused has civilian counsel provided by the accused and

qualified under R.C.M. 502(d)(3), that counsel shall be permitted to represent

the accused at the summary court-martial if such appearance will not unreasonably

delay the proceedings and if military exigencies do not preclude it.

#### Discussion

Neither the Constitution nor any statute establishes any right to

 counsel at summary courts-martial. Therefore, it is not error to deny an

accused the opportunity to be represented by counsel at a summary court-martial.

However, appearance of counsel is not prohibited. The detailing authority

 may, as a matter of discretion, detail, or otherwise make available, a military

attorney to represent the accused at a summary court-martial.

### (f) Power to obtain witnesses and evidence.

A summary court-martial may obtain evidence pursuant to R.C.M.

703.

#### Discussion

The summary court-martial must obtain witnesses for the prosecution

 and the defense pursuant to the standards in R.C.M. 703. The summary court-martial

rules on any request by the accused for witnesses or evidence in accordance

with the procedure in R.C.M. 703(c) and (f).

### (g) Secretarial limitations.

The Secretary concerned may prescribe procedural or other rules

for summary courts-martial not inconsistent with this Manual or the code.

## Rule 1302. Convening a summary court-martial

### (a) Who may convene summary courts-martial.

Unless limited by competent authority summary courts-martial may

be convened by:

(1) Any person who may convene a general or special court-martial;

(2) The commander of a detached company or other detachment of the Army;

(3) The commander of a detached squadron or other detachment of the

Air Force;

(4) The commander or officer in charge of any other command when empowered

by the Secretary concerned; or

(5) A superior competent authority to any of the above.

### (b) When convening authority is accuser.

If the convening authority or the summary court-martial is the

accuser, it is discretionary with the convening authority whether to forward

the charges to a superior authority with a recommendation to convene the

summary court-martial. If the convening authority or the summary court-martial

is the accuser, the jurisdiction of the summary court-martial is not affected.

### (c) Procedure.

After the requirements of Chapters III and IV of this Part have

been satisfied, summary courts-martial shall be convened in accordance with

R.C.M. 504(d)(2). The convening order may be by notation signed by the convening

authority on the charge sheet. Charges shall be referred to summary courts-martial

in accordance with R.C.M. 601.

#### Discussion

When the convening authority is the summary court-martial because

the convening authority is the only commissioned officer present with the

command or detachment, _ see_ R.C.M. 1301(a), that fact should

 be noted on the charge sheet.

## Rule 1303. Right to object to trial by summary court-martial

No person who objects thereto before arraignment may be tried by

 summary court-martial even if that person also refused punishment under

Article 15 and demanded trial by court-martial for the same offenses.

### Discussion

If the accused objects to trial by summary court-martial, the convening

authority may dispose of the case in accordance with R.C.M. 401.

## Rule 1304. Trial procedure

### (a) Pretrial duties.

#### (1) Examination of file.

The summary court-martial shall carefully examine the charge sheet,

 allied papers, and immediately available personnel records of the accused

before trial.

##### Discussion

"Personnel records" are those personnel records of the

 accused which are maintained locally and are immediately available. "Allied

papers" in a summary court-martial include convening orders, investigative

reports, correspondence relating to the case, and witness statements.

#### (2) Report of irregularity.

The summary court-martial shall report to the convening authority

any substantial irregularity in the charge sheet, allied papers, or personnel

records.

##### Discussion

The summary court-martial should examine the charge sheet, allied

 papers, and personnel records to ensure that they are complete and free

from errors or omissions which might affect admissibility. The summary court-martial

 should check the charges and specifications to ensure that each alleges

personal jurisdiction over the accused (_see_ R.C.M. 202)

and an offense under the code (_see_ R.C.M. 203 and Part IV).

 Substantial defects or errors in the charges and specifications must be

 reported to the convening authority, since such defects cannot be corrected

except by preferring and referring the affected charge and specification

anew in proper form. A defect or error is substantial if correcting it would

state an offense not otherwise stated, or include an offense, person, or

matter not fairly included in the specification as preferred. _See

_ subsection (3) below concerning minor errors.

#### (3) Correction and amendment.

The summary court-martial may, subject to R.C.M. 603, correct errors

 on the charge sheet and amend charges and specifications. Any such corrections

 or amendments shall be initialed.

### (b) Summary court-martial procedure.

## Rule 104. Unlawful command influence

### (a) General prohibitions.

#### (1) Convening authorities and commanders.

No convening authority or commander may censure, reprimand, or

admonish a court-martial or other military tribunal or any member, military

 judge, or counsel thereof, with respect to the findings or sentence adjudged

by the court-martial or tribunal, or with respect to any other exercise of

the functions of the court-martial or tribunal or such persons in the conduct

of the proceedings.

#### (2) All persons subject to the code.

No person subject to the code may attempt to coerce or, by any unauthorized

means, influence the action of a court-martial or any other military tribunal

or any member thereof, in reaching the findings or sentence in any case or

the action of any convening, approving, or reviewing authority with respect

to such authority's judicial acts.

#### (3) Exceptions.

##### (A) Instructions.

Subsections (a)(1) and (2) of the rule do not prohibit general instructional

or informational courses in military justice if such courses are designed

solely for the purpose of instructing personnel of a command in the substantive

and procedural aspects of courts-martial.

##### (B) Court-martial statements.

Subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this rule do not prohibit statements

and instructions given in open session by the military judge or counsel.

##### (C) Professional supervision.

Subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this rule do not prohibit action by

the Judge Advocate General concerned under R.C.M. 109.

##### (D) Offense.

Subsection (a)(1) and (2) of this rule do not prohibit appropriate

action against a person for an offense committed while detailed as a military

judge, counsel, or member of a court-martial, or while serving as individual

counsel.

### (b) Prohibitions concerning evaluations.

#### (1) Evaluation of member or defense counsel.

In the preparation of an effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency report

or any other report or document used in whole or in part for the purpose

of determining whether a member of the armed forces is qualified to be advanced

in grade, or in determining the assignment or transfer of a member of the

armed forces, or in determining whether a member of the armed forces should

be retained on active duty, no person subject to the code may:

(A) Consider or evaluate the performance of duty of any such person

as a member of a court-martial; or

(B) Give a less favorable rating or evaluation of any defense counsel

because of the zeal with which such counsel represented any accused.

#### (2) Evaluation of military judge.

##### (A) General courts-martial.

Unless the general court-martial was convened by the President or

the Secretary concerned, neither the convening authority nor any member of

the convening authority's staff may prepare or review any report concerning

the effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency of the military judge detailed to

a general court-martial, which relates to the performance of duty as a military

judge.

##### (B) Special courts-martial.

The convening authority may not prepare or review any report concerning

the effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency of a military judge detailed to

a special court-martial which relates to the performance of duty as a military

judge. When the military judge is normally rated or the military judge's report

is reviewed by the convening authority, the manner in which such military

judge will be rated or evaluated upon the performance of duty as a military

judge may be as prescribed in regulations of the Secretary concerned which

shall ensure the absence of any command influence in the rating or evaluation

of the military judge's judicial performance.

###### Discussion

_See_ paragraph 22 of Part IV concerning prosecuting

violations of Article 37 under Article 98.

## Rule 105. Direct communications: convening authorities and staff judge advocates;

 among staff judge advocates

### (a) Convening authorities and staff judge advocates.

Convening authorities shall at all times communicate directly with

their staff judge advocates in matters relating to the administration of

military justice.

### (b) Among staff judge advocates and with the Judge Advocate General.

The staff judge advocate of any command is entitled to communicate

directly with the staff judge advocate of a superior or subordinate command,

or with the Judge Advocate General.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 103(17) for a definition of staff judge

 advocate.

## Rule 106. Delivery of military offenders to civilian authorities

Under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe,

a member of the armed forces accused of an offense against civilian authority

may be delivered, upon request, to the civilian authority for trial. A member

may be placed in restraint by military authorities for this purpose only

upon receipt of a duly issued warrant for the apprehension of the member

or upon receipt of information establishing probable cause that the member

committed an offense, and upon reasonable belief that such restraint is necessary.

Such restraint may continue only for such time as is reasonably necessary

to effect the delivery.

### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(2)(A)(ii) for the effect of

such delivery on the execution of a court-martial sentence.

## Rule 107. Dismissed officer's right to request trial by court-martial

If a commissioned officer of any armed force is dismissed by order

of the President under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1161(a)(3), that officer may apply

for trial by general court-martial within a reasonable time.

### Discussion

_See_ Article 4 for the procedures to be followed. _

See also_ Article 75(c).

## Rule 108. Rules of court

The Judge Advocate General concerned and persons designated by the

 Judge Advocate General may make rules of court not inconsistent with these

 rules for the conduct of court-martial proceedings. Such rules shall be

disseminated in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Judge Advocate

 General concerned or a person to whom this authority has been delegated.

 Noncompliance with such procedures shall not affect the validity of any rule

of court with respect to a party who has received actual and timely notice

of the rule or who has not been prejudiced under Article 59 by the absence

of such notice. Copies of all rules of court issued under this rule shall

be forwarded to the Judge Advocate General concerned.

## Rule 109. Professional supervision of military judges and counsel

### (a) In general.

Each Judge Advocate General is responsible for the professional

supervision and discipline of military trial and appellate military judges,

judge advocates, and other lawyers who practice in proceedings governed by

the code and this Manual. To discharge this responsibility each Judge Advocate

General may prescribe rules of professional conduct not inconsistent with

this rule or this Manual. Rules of professional conduct promulgated pursuant

to this rule may include sanctions for violations of such rules. Sanctions

may include but are not limited to indefinite suspension from practice in

courts-martial and in the Courts of Criminal Appeals. Such suspensions may

only be imposed by the Judge Advocate General of the armed service of such

courts. Prior to imposing any discipline under this rule, the subject of the

proposed action must be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard. The

Judge Advocate General concerned may upon good cause shown modify or revoke

suspension. Procedures to investigate complaints against military trial judges

 and appellate military judges are contained in subsection (c) of this rule.

### (b) Action after suspension or disbarment.

When a Judge Advocate General suspends a person from practice or

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces disbars a person, any Judge Advocate

 General may suspend that person from practice upon written notice and opportunity

to be heard in writing.

### (c) Investigation of judges.

#### (1) In general.

These rules and procedures promulgated pursuant to Article 6a are

 established to investigate and dispose of charges, allegations, or information

 pertaining to the fitness of a military trial judge or appellate military

judge to perform the duties of the judge's office.

#### (2) Policy.

Allegations of judicial misconduct or unfitness shall be investigated

pursuant to the procedures of this rule and appropriate action shall be taken.

Judicial misconduct includes any act or omission that may serve to demonstrate

unfitness for further duty as a judge, including, but not limited to violations

of applicable ethical standards.

##### Discussion

The term "unfitness" should be construed broadly, including,

for example, matters relating to the incompetence, impartiality, and misconduct

of the judge. Erroneous decisions of a judge are not subject to investigation

under this rule. Challenges to these decisions are more appropriately left

to the appellate process.

#### (3) Complaints.

Complaints concerning a military trial judge or appellate military

 judge will be forwarded to the Judge Advocate General of the service concerned

 or to a person designated by the Judge Advocate General concerned to receive

such complaints.

##### Discussion

Complaints need not be made in any specific form, but if possible

 complaints should be made under oath. Complaints may be made by judges,

lawyers, a party, court personnel, members of the general public or members

of the military community. Reports in the news media relating to the conduct

of a judge may also form the basis of a complaint.

  An individual

designated to receive complaints under this subsection should have judicial

experience. The chief trial judge of a service may be designated to receive

complaints against military trial judges.

#### (4) Initial action upon receipt of a complaint.

Upon receipt, a complaint will be screened by the Judge Advocate

 General concerned or by the individual designated in subsection (c)(3) of

this rule to receive complaints. An initial inquiry is necessary if the

complaint, taken as true, would constitute judicial misconduct or unfitness

for further service as a judge. Prior to the commencement of an initial inquiry,

the Judge Advocate General concerned shall be notified that a complaint has

been filed and that an initial inquiry will be conducted. The Judge Advocate

General concerned may temporarily suspend the subject of a complaint from

performing judicial duties pending the outcome of any inquiry or investigation

conducted pursuant to this rule. Such inquiries or investigations shall be

conducted with reasonable promptness.

##### Discussion

Complaints under this subsection will be treated with confidentiality.

Confidentiality protects the subject judge and the judiciary when a complaint

is not substantiated. Confidentiality also encourages the reporting of allegations

of judicial misconduct or unfitness and permits complaints to be screened

with the full cooperation of others.

 Complaints containing allegations

of criminality should be referred to the appropriate criminal investigative

agency in accordance with Appendix 3 of this Manual.

#### (5) Initial inquiry.

##### (A) In general.

An initial inquiry is necessary to determine if the complaint is

 substantiated. A complaint is substantiated upon finding that it is more

likely than not that the subject judge has engaged in judicial misconduct

or is otherwise unfit for further service as a judge.

##### (B) Responsibility to conduct initial inquiry.

The Judge Advocate General concerned, or the person designated to

 receive complaints under subsection (c)(3) of this rule will conduct or order

 an initial inquiry. The individual designated to conduct the inquiry should,

if practicable, be senior to the subject of the complaint. If the subject

of the complaint is a military trial judge, the individual designated to

conduct the initial inquiry should, if practicable, be a military trial judge

or an individual with experience as a military trial judge. If the subject

of the complaint is an appellate military judge, the individual designated

to conduct the inquiry should, if practicable, have experience as an appellate

military judge.

###### Discussion

To avoid the type of conflict prohibited in Article 66(g), the Judge

 Advocate General's designee should not ordinarily be a member of the same

Court of Criminal Appeals as the subject of the complaint. If practicable,

a former appellate military judge should be designated.

##### (C) Due process.

During the initial inquiry, the subject of the complaint will, at

a minimum, be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

##### (D) Action following the initial inquiry.

If the complaint is not substantiated pursuant to subsection (c)(5)(A)

of this rule, the complaint shall be dismissed as unfounded. If the complaint

is substantiated, minor professional disciplinary action may be taken or

the complaint may be forwarded, with findings and recommendations, to the

Judge Advocate General concerned. Minor professional disciplinary action is

defined as counseling or the issuance of an oral or written admonition or

reprimand. The Judge Advocate General concerned will be notified prior to

taking minor professional disciplinary action or dismissing a complaint as

 unfounded.

#### (6) Action by the Judge Advocate General.

##### (A) In general.

The Judge Advocates General are responsible for the professional

 supervision and discipline of military trial and appellate military judges

under their jurisdiction. Upon receipt of findings and recommendations required

by subsection (c)(5) of this rule the Judge Advocate General concerned will

take appropriate action.

##### (B) Appropriate actions.

The Judge Advocate General concerned may dismiss the complaint,

order an additional inquiry, appoint an ethics commission to consider the

complaint, refer the matter to another appropriate investigative agency or

take appropriate professional disciplinary action pursuant to the rules of

 professional conduct prescribed by the Judge Advocate General under subsection

 (a) of this rule. Any decision of the Judge Advocate General, under this

rule, is final and is not subject to appeal.

###### Discussion

The discretionary reassignment of military trial judges or appellate

 military judges to meet the needs of the service is not professional disciplinary

action.

##### (C) Standard of proof.

Prior to taking professional disciplinary action, other than minor

disciplinary action as defined in subsection (c)(5) of this rule, the Judge

Advocate General concerned shall find, in writing, that the subject of the

complaint engaged in judicial misconduct or is otherwise unfit for continued

service as a military judge, and that such misconduct or unfitness is established

by clear and convincing evidence.

##### (D) Due process.

Prior to taking final action on the complaint, the Judge Advocate

 General concerned will ensure that the subject of the complaint is, at a

 minimum, given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

#### (7) The Ethics Commission.

##### (A) Membership.

If appointed pursuant to subsection (c)(6)(B) of this rule, an ethics

 commission shall consist of at least three members. If the subject

of the complaint is a military trial judge, the commission should include

one or more military trial judges or individuals with experience as a military

trial judge. If the subject of the complaint is an appellate military judge,

the commission should include one or more individuals with experience as

an appellate military judge. Members of the commission should, if practicable,

 be senior to the subject of the complaint.

##### (B) Duties.

The commission will perform those duties assigned by the Judge

Advocate General concerned. Normally, the commission will provide an opinion

as to whether the subject's acts or omissions constitute judicial misconduct

or unfitness. If the commission determines that the affected judge engaged

in judicial misconduct or is unfit for continued judicial service, the commission

may be required to recommend an appropriate disposition to The Judge Advocate

General concerned.

###### Discussion

The Judge Advocate General concerned may appoint an ad hoc or a

standing commission.

#### (8) Rules of procedure.

The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the service concerned

 may establish additional procedures consistent with this rule and Article

 6a.

# CHAPTER II. JURISDICTION

## Rule 201. Jurisdiction in general

### (a) Nature of courts-martial jurisdiction.

(1) The jurisdiction of courts-martial is entirely penal or disciplinary.

##### Discussion

"Jurisdiction" means the power to hear a case and to

 render a legally competent decision. A court-martial has no power to adjudge

 civil remedies. For example, a court-martial may not adjudge the payment

of damages, collect private debts, order the return of property, or order

a criminal forfeiture of seized property. A summary court-martial appointed

under 10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 4712 or 9712 to dispose of the effects of a

deceased person is not affected by these Rules or this Manual.

(2) The code applies in all places.

##### Discussion

 Except insofar as required by the Constitution, the Code, or the Manual, such as persons listed under Article 2(a)(10), jurisdiction of courts-martial does not depend on where the offense was committed.

(3) The jurisdiction of a court-martial with respect to offenses under

the code is not affected by the place where the court-martial sits. The jurisdiction

of a court-martial with respect to military government or the law of war

is not affected by the place where the court-martial sits except as otherwise

expressly required by this Manual or applicable rule of international law.

##### Discussion

In addition to the power to try persons for offenses under the code,

 general courts-martial have power to try certain persons for violations of

the law of war and for crimes or offenses against the law of the territory

occupied as an incident of war or belligerency whenever the local civil authority

is superseded in whole or part by the military authority of the occupying

power. _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(B). In cases where a person

is tried by general court-martial for offenses against the law of an occupied

territory, the court-martial normally sits in the country where the offense

is committed, and must do so under certain circumstances. _See_ Articles

4, 64, and 66, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons

in Time of War, August 12, 1949, arts. 4, 64, and 66, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 3559-60

 T.I.A.S. No. 3365.

### (b) Requisites of court-martial jurisdiction.

A court-martial always has jurisdiction to determine whether it

has jurisdiction. Otherwise for a court-martial to have jurisdiction:

(1) The court-martial must be convened by an official empowered to convene

it;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 504; 1302.

(2) The court-martial must be composed in accordance with these rules

 with respect to number and qualifications of its personnel. As used here

 "personnel" includes only the military judge, the members, and

the summary court-martial;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 501-504; 1301.

(3) Each charge before the court-martial must be referred to it by

competent authority;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 601.

(4) The accused must be a person subject to court-martial jurisdiction;

 and

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 202.

(5) The offense must be subject to court-martial jurisdiction.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 203.

  The judgment

of a court-martial without jurisdiction is void and is entitled to no legal

effect. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)(iv). _But see_ R.C.M.

 810(d) concerning the effect of certain decisions by courts-martial without

jurisdiction.

### (c) Contempt.

A judge detailed to a court-martial may punish for contempt any person who uses any menacing word, sign, or gesture in the presence of the judge during the proceedings of the court-martial; disturbs the proceedings of the court-martial by any riot or disorder; or willfully disobeys the lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the court-martial. The punishment may not exceed confinement for 30 days or a fine of $1,000, or both.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 809 for procedures and standards for

contempt proceedings.

### (d) Exclusive and nonexclusive jurisdiction.

(1) Courts-martial have exclusive jurisdiction of purely military offenses.

(2) An act or omission which violates both the code and local criminal

law, foreign or domestic, may be tried by a court-martial, or by a proper

civilian tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, subject to R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)

and regulations of the Secretary concerned, by both.

(3) Where an act or omission is subject to trial by court-martial and

by one or more civil tribunals, foreign or domestic, the determination which

nation, state, or agency will exercise jurisdiction is a matter for the nations,

states, and agencies concerned, and is not a right of the suspect or accused.

##### Discussion

In the case of an act or omission which violates the code and a

 criminal law of a State, the United States, or both, the determination which

agency shall exercise jurisdiction should normally be made through consultation

or prior agreement between appropriate military officials (ordinarily the

staff judge advocate) and appropriate civilian authorities (United States

Attorney, or equivalent). _See also_ Memorandum of Understanding

Between Departments of Justice and Defense Relating to the Investigation

and Prosecution of Crimes Over Which the Two Departments Have Concurrent

Jurisdiction at Appendix 3.

  Under the Constitution, a person

may not be tried for the same misconduct by both a court-martial and another

federal court. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Although it is constitutionally

permissible to try a person by court-martial and by a State court for the

same act, as a matter of policy a person who is pending trial or has been

tried by a State court should not ordinarily be tried by court-martial for

the same act. Overseas, international agreements might preclude trial by

one state of a person acquitted or finally convicted of a given act by the

other state.

  Under international law, a friendly foreign

nation has jurisdiction to punish offenses committed within its borders by

members of a visiting force, unless expressly or impliedly consents to relinquish

its jurisdiction to the visiting sovereign. The procedures and standards

for determining which nation will exercise jurisdiction are normally established

by treaty. _See_, for example, NATO Status of Forces Agreement,

June 19, 1951, 4 U.S.T. 1792, T.I.A.S. No. 2846. As a matter of policy, efforts

should be made to maximize the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over

persons subject to the code to the extent possible under applicable agreements.

 _

See_ R.C.M. 106 concerning delivery of offenders to civilian authorities.

 _

See_ also R.C.M. 201(g) concerning the jurisdiction of other military

tribunals.

### (e) Reciprocal jurisdiction.

(1) Each armed force has court-martial jurisdiction over all persons

subject to the code.

(2)(A) A commander of a unified or specified combatant command may convene

 courts-martial over members of any of the armed forces.

(B) So much of the authority vested in the President under Article

22(a)(9) to empower any commanding officer of a joint command or joint task

 force to convene courts-martial is delegated to the Secretary of Defense,

and such a commanding officer may convene general courts-martial for the

trial of members of any of the armed forces assigned or attached to a combatant command or joint command.

(C) A commander who is empowered to convene a court-martial under subsections

(e)(2)(A) or (e)(2)(B) of this rule may expressly authorize a commanding

officer of a subordinate joint command or subordinate joint task force who

is authorized to convene special and summary courts-martial to convene such

courts-martial for the trial of members of other armed forces assigned or attached to a joint command or joint task force, under regulations

which the superior command may prescribe.

(3) A member of one armed force may be tried by a court-martial convened

 by a member of another armed force, using the implementing regulations and procedures prescribed by the Secretary concerned of the military service of the accused, when:

(A) The court-martial is convened by a commander authorized to convene

 courts-martial under subsection (e)(2) of this rule; or

(B) The accused cannot be delivered to the armed force of which the

 accused is a member without manifest injury to the armed forces.

An

accused should not ordinarily be tried by a court-martial convened by a member

of a different armed force except when the circumstances described in (A)

or (B) exist. However, failure to comply with this policy does not affect

an otherwise valid referral.

(4) Nothing in this rule prohibits detailing to a court-martial a military

judge, member, or counsel who is a member of an armed force different from that of the accused

or the convening authority, or both.

(5) In all cases, departmental review after that by the officer with

authority to convene a general court-martial for the command which held the

trial, where that review is required by the code, shall be carried out by

the department that includes the armed force of which the accused is a member.

(6) When there is a disagreement between the Secretaries of two military

 departments or between the Secretary of a military department and the commander

 of a unified or specified combatant command or other joint command or joint

 task force as to which organization should exercise jurisdiction over a particular

case or class of cases, the Secretary of Defense or an official acting under

the authority of the Secretary of Defense shall designate which organization

will exercise jurisdiction.

(7) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) or as otherwise directed

by the President or Secretary of Defense, whenever action under this Manual

is required or authorized to be taken by a person superior to-

(A) a commander of a unified or specified combatant command or;

(B) a commander of any other joint command or joint task force that

is not part of a unified or specified combatant command, the matter

shall be referred to the Secretary of the armed force of which the accused

is a member. The Secretary may convene a court-martial, take other appropriate

action, or, subject to R.C.M. 504(c), refer the matter to any person authorized

to convene a court-martial of the accused.

###### Discussion

As to the authority to convene courts-martial, see R.C.M. 504.

"Manifest injury" does not mean minor inconvenience

or expense. Examples of manifest injury include direct and substantial effect

on morale, discipline, or military operations, substantial expense or delay,

or loss of essential witnesses.

  As to the composition of

a court-martial for the trial of an accused who is a member of another armed

force, _see_ R.C.M. 503(a)(3) Discussion. Cases involving

two or more accused who are members of different armed forces should not

be referred to a court-martial for a common trial.

### (f) Types of courts-martial.

**[Note: R.C.M. 201(f)(1) and (f)(2) apply to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.]**

#### (1) General courts-martial.

##### (A) Cases under the code.

(i) Except as otherwise expressly provided, general courts-martial may

try any person subject to the code for any offense made punishable under

the code. General courts-martial also may try any person for a violation

of Article 83, 104, or 106.

(ii) Upon a finding of guilty of an offense made punishable by the code,

 general courts-martial may, within limits prescribed by this Manual, adjudge

 any punishment authorized under R.C.M. 1003.

(iii) Notwithstanding any other rule, the death penalty may not be adjudged

if:

(a) Not specifically authorized for the offense by the code and Part

IV of this Manual; or

(b) The case has not been referred with a special instruction that the

case is to be tried as capital.

##### (B) Cases under the law of war.

(i) General courts-martial may try any person who by the law of war

is subject to trial by military tribunal for any crime or offense against:

(a) The law of war; or

(b) The law of the territory occupied as an incident of war or belligerency

whenever the local civil authority is superseded in whole or part by the

military authority of the occupying power. The law of the occupied territory

 includes the local criminal law as adopted or modified by competent authority,

and the proclamations, ordinances, regulations, or orders promulgated by

competent authority of the occupying power.

######## Discussion

Subsection (f)(1)(B)(i)(b) is an exercise of the

power of military government.

(ii) When a general court-martial exercises jurisdiction under the law

of war, it may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war.

####### Discussion

Certain limitations on the discretion of military tribunals to adjudge

punishment under the law of war are prescribed in international conventions. _

See_, for example, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of

Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 68, 6 U.S.T. 3516, T.I.A.S.

No. 3365.

##### (C) Limitations in judge alone cases.

A general court-martial composed only of a military judge does not

have jurisdiction to try any person for any offense for which the death penalty

may be adjudged unless the case has been referred to trial as noncapital.

##### (D) Jurisdiction for Certain Sexual Offenses.

 Only a general court-martial has jurisdiction to try offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), and 120b(b), UCMJ, forcible sodomy under Article 125, UCMJ, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ.

#### (2) Special courts-martial.

##### (A) In general.

Except as otherwise expressly provided, special courts-martial may

try any person subject to the code for any noncapital offense made punishable

by the code and, as provided in this rule, for capital offenses.

##### (B) Punishments.

(i) Upon a finding of guilty, special courts-martial may adjudge, under

limitations prescribed by this Manual, any punishment authorized under R.C.M.

1003 except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal, confinement for more

than 1 year, hard labor without confinement for more than 3 months, forfeiture

of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture of pay for more

than 1 year.

(ii) A bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or

forfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged by a special

court-martial unless:

(a) Counsel qualified under Article 27(b) is detailed to represent the

 accused; and

(b) A military judge is detailed to the trial, except in a case in which

a military judge could not be detailed because of physical conditions or

military exigencies. Physical conditions or military exigencies, as the terms

are here used, may exist under rare circumstances, such as on an isolated

ship on the high seas or in a unit in an inaccessible area, provided compelling

reasons exist why trial must be held at that time and at that place. Mere

 inconvenience does not constitute a physical condition or military exigency

and does not excuse a failure to detail a military judge. If a military judge

cannot be detailed because of physical conditions or military exigencies,

a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture

of pay for more than six months, may be adjudged provided the other conditions

have been met. In that event, however, the convening authority shall, prior

to trial, make a written statement explaining why a military judge could

not be obtained. This statement shall be appended to the record of trial

and shall set forth in detail the reasons why a military judge could not be

detailed, and why the trial had to be held at that time and place.

######## Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 503 concerning detailing the military

judge and counsel.

  The requirement for counsel is satisfied

when counsel qualified under Article 27(b), and not otherwise disqualified,

has been detailed and made available, even though the accused may not choose

to cooperate with, or use the services of, such detailed counsel.

  The

physical condition or military exigency exception to the requirement for

a military judge does not apply to the requirement for detailing counsel qualified

under Article 27(b).

  _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(c)

concerning the requirements for a record of trial in special courts-martial.

##### (C) Capital offenses

(i) A capital offense for which there is prescribed a mandatory punishment

beyond the punitive power of a special court-martial shall not be referred

to such a court-martial.

(ii) An officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the

command which includes the accused may permit any capital offense other than

one described in subsection (f)(2)(C)(i) of this rule to be referred to a

special court-martial for trial.

(iii) The Secretary concerned may authorize, by regulation, officers exercising

special court-martial jurisdiction to refer capital offenses, other than

those described in subsection (f)(2)(C)(i) of this rule, to trial by special

court-martial without first obtaining the consent of the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the command.

###### (D) Certain Offenses under Articles 120, 120b, and 125.

Notwithstanding subsection (f)(2)(A), special courts-martial do not have jurisdiction over offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), and 120b(b), forcible sodomy under Article 125, UCMJ, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ. Such offenses shall not be referred to a special court-martial.

####### Discussion

 Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, only a general court-martial has jurisdiction over penetrative sex offenses under subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120, subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120b, Article 125, and attempts to commit such penetrative sex offenses under Article 80, UCMJ.

####### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 103(3) for a definition of capital offenses.

#### (3) Summary courts-martial.

_See_ R.C.M. 1301(c) and (d)(1).

### (g) Concurrent jurisdiction of other military tribunals.

The provisions of the code and this Manual conferring jurisdiction

 upon courts-martial do not deprive military commissions, provost courts,

or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders

or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military

commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.

#### Discussion

_See_ Articles 104 and 106 for some instances of

concurrent jurisdiction.

## Rule 202. Persons subject to the jurisdiction of courts-martial

### (a) In general.

Courts-martial may try any person when authorized to do so under

the code.

#### Discussion

##### (1) Authority under the code.

Article 2 lists classes of persons who are subject to the code.

These include active duty personnel (Article 2(a)(1)); cadets, aviation cadets,

and midshipmen (Article 2(a)(2)); certain retired personnel (Article 2(a)(4)

and (5)); members of Reserve components not on active duty under some circumstances

(Article 2(a)(3) and (6)); persons in the custody of the armed forces serving

a sentence imposed by court-martial (Article 2(a)(7)); and, under some circumstances,

specified categories of civilians (Article 2(a)(8), (9), (10), (11), and

(12); _see_ subsection (3) and (4) of this discussion). In

 addition, certain persons whose status as members of the armed forces or

as persons otherwise subject to the code apparently has ended may, nevertheless,

be amendable to trial by court-martial. _See_ Article 3, 4,

and 73. A person need not be subject to the code to be subject to trial by

court-martial under Articles 83, 104, or 106. _See also_ Article

48 and R.C.M. 809 concerning who may be subject to the contempt powers of

a court-martial.

##### (2) Active duty personnel.

Court-martial jurisdiction is most commonly exercised over active

 duty personnel. In general, a person becomes subject to court-martial jurisdiction

upon enlistment in or induction into the armed forces, acceptance of a commission,

or entry onto active duty pursuant to orders. Court-martial jurisdiction

over active duty personnel ordinarily ends on delivery of a discharge certificate

 or its equivalent to the person concerned issued pursuant to competent orders.

Orders transferring a person to the inactive reserve are the equivalent of

a discharge certificate for purposes of jurisdiction.

  These

are several important qualifications and exceptions to these general guidelines.

###### (A) Inception of court-martial jurisdiction over active duty personnel.

####### (i) Enlistment.

"The voluntary enlistment of any person who has the capacity

to understand the significance of enlisting in the armed forces shall be

valid for purposes of jurisdiction under [Article 2(a)]

and a change of status from civilian to member of the armed forces shall be

 effective upon taking the oath of enlistment." Article 2(b). A person

who is, at the time of enlistment, insane, intoxicated, or under the age

of 17 does not have the capacity to enlist by law. No court-martial jurisdiction

over such a person may exist as long as the incapacity continues. If the incapacity

ceases to exist, a "constructive enlistment" may result under

Article 2(c). _See_ discussion of "constructive enlistment"

below. Similarly, if the enlistment was involuntary, court-martial jurisdiction

will exist only when the coercion is removed and a "constructive enlistment"

under Article 2(c) is established.

  Persons age 17 (but not

yet 18) may not enlist without parental consent. A parent or guardian may,

within 90 days of its inception, terminate the enlistment of a 17-year-old

who enlisted without parental consent, if the person has not yet reached

the age of 18. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1170. _See also_ DOD Directive

1332.14 and service regulations for specific rules on separation of persons

17 years of age on the basis of a parental request. Absent effective action

by a parent or guardian to terminate such an enlistment, court-martial jurisdiction

exists over the person. An application by a parent for release does not deprive

a court-martial of jurisdiction to try a person for offenses committed before

action is completed on such an application.

  Even if a person

lacked capacity to understand the effect of enlistment or did not enlist voluntarily,

a "constructive enlistment" may be established under Article

2(c), which provides:

    Notwithstanding any other

provision of law, a person serving with an armed force who-

submitted voluntary to military authority;

met the mental competency and minimum age qualifications

of sections 504 and 505 of this title at the time of voluntary submission

to military authority [that is, not insane, intoxicated, or under

the age of 17]

received military pay or allowances; and

performed military duties;



is subject to [the code] until such person's

active service has been terminated in accordance with law or regulations

promulgated by the Secretary concerned.

  Even if a person

never underwent an enlistment or induction proceeding of any kind, court-martial

jurisdiction could be established under this provision.

####### (ii) Induction.

Court-martial jurisdiction does not extend to a draftee until: the

 draftee has completed an induction ceremony which was in substantial compliance

with the requirements prescribed by statute and regulations; the draftee

by conduct after an apparent induction, has waived objection to substantive

defects in it; or a "constructive enlistment" under Article 2(c)

exists.

  The fact that a person was improperly inducted (for

example, because of incorrect classification or erroneous denial of exemption)

does not of itself negate court-martial jurisdiction. When a person has made

timely and persistent efforts to correct such an error, court-martial jurisdiction

may be defeated if improper induction is found, depending on all the circumstances

of the case.

####### (iii) Call to active duty.

A member of a reserve component may be called or ordered to active

 duty for a variety of reasons, including training, service in time of war

or national emergency, discipline, or as a result of failure to participate

satisfactorily in unit activities.

  When a person is ordered

to active duty for failure to satisfactorily participate in unit activities,

the order must substantially comply with procedures prescribed by regulations,

to the extent due process requires, for court-martial jurisdiction to exist.

Generally, the person must be given notice of the activation and the reasons

therefor, and an opportunity to object to the activation. A person waives

the right to contest involuntary activation by failure to exercise this right

 within a reasonable time after notice of the right to do so.

###### (B) Termination of jurisdiction over active duty personnel.

As indicated above, the delivery of a valid discharge certificate

or its equivalent ordinarily serves to terminate court-martial jurisdiction.

####### (i) Effect of completion of term of service.

Completion of an enlistment or term of service does not by itself

 terminate court-martial jurisdiction. An original term of enlistment may

be adjusted for a variety of reasons, such as making up time lost for unauthorized

absence. Even after such adjustments are considered, court-martial jurisdiction

normally continues past the time of scheduled separation until a discharge

certificate or its equivalent is delivered or until the Government fails to

act within a reasonable time after the person objects to continued retention.

  As

indicated in subsection (c) of this rule, servicemembers may be retained

past their scheduled time of separation, over protest, by action with a view

to trial while they are still subject to the code. Thus, if action with a

view to trial is initiated before discharge or the effective terminal date

of self-executing orders, a person may be retained beyond the date that the

 period of service would otherwise have expired or the terminal date of such

orders.

####### (ii) Effect of discharge and reenlistment.

For offenses occurring on or after 23 October 1992, under the 1992

 Amendment to Article 3(a), a person who reenlists following a discharge may

be tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service. For offenses

occurring prior to 23 October 1992, a person who reenlists following a discharge

may be tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service only

if the offense was punishable by confinement for five (5) years or more and

could not be tried in the courts of the United States or of a State, a Territory,

or the District of Columbia. However, _see_ (iii)(a) below.

####### (iii) Exceptions.

There are several exceptions to the general principle that court-martial

jurisdiction terminates on discharge or its equivalent.

(a) A person who was subject to the code at the time an offense was

 committed may be tried by court-martial for that offense despite a later

discharge or other termination of that status if:

(1) For offenses occurring on or after 23 October 1992, the person is,

at the time of the court-martial, subject to the code, by reentry into the

armed forces or otherwise. _See_ Article 3(a) as amended by

the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-484,

106 Stat. 2315, 2505 (1992);

(2) For offenses occurring before 23 October 1992,

(A) The offense is one for which a court-martial may adjudge confinement

for five (5) or more years;

(B) The person cannot be tried in the courts of the United States or

of a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia; and

(C) The person is, at the time of the court-martial, subject to the

code, by reentry into the armed forces or otherwise. _See_ Article

3(a) prior to the 1992 amendment.

(b) A person who was subject to the code at the time the offense was

committed is subject to trial by court-martial despite a later discharge

if-

(1) The discharge was issued before the end of the accused's term of

enlistment for the purpose of reenlisting;

(2) The person remains, at the time of the court-martial, subject to

the code; and

(3) The reenlistment occurred after 26 July 1982.

(c) Persons in the custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposed

by a court-martial remain subject to the code and court-martial jurisdiction.

A prisoner who has received a discharge and who remains in the custody of

an armed force may be tried for an offense committed while a member of the

armed forces and before the execution of the discharge as well as for offenses

committed after it.

(d) A person discharged from the armed forces who is later charged with

having fraudulently obtained that discharge is, subject to the statute of

limitations, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge, and is after

apprehension subject to the code while in the custody of the armed forces

for trial. Upon conviction of that charge such a person is subject to trial

by court-martial for any offenses under the code committed before the fraudulent

discharge.

(e) No person who has deserted from the armed forces is relieved from

court-martial jurisdiction by a separation from any later period of service.

(f) When a person's discharge or other separation does not interrupt

the status as a person belonging to the general category of persons subject

to the code, court-martial jurisdiction over that person does not end. For

example, when an officer holding a commission in a Reserve component of an

armed force is discharged from that commission while on active duty because

of acceptance of a commission in a Regular component of that armed force,

without an interval between the periods of service under the two commissions,

that officer's military status does not end. There is merely a change in

personnel status from temporary to permanent officer, and court-martial jurisdiction

over an offense committed before the discharge is not affected.

###### (3) Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Members of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and

Atmospheric Administration become subject to the code when assigned to and

serving with the armed forces.

###### (4) Limitations on jurisdiction over civilians.

Court-martial jurisdiction over civilians under the code is limited by the Constitution and other applicable laws, including as construed in judicial decisions. The exercise of jurisdiction under Article 2(a)(11) in peace time has been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.  Before initiating court-martial proceedings against a civilian, relevant statutes, decisions, service regulations, and policy memoranda should be carefully examined.

###### (5) Members of a Reserve Component.

Members of a reserve component in federal service on active duty,

as well as those in federal service on inactive-duty training, are subject

to the code. Moreover, members of a reserve component are amenable to the

jurisdiction of courts-martial notwithstanding the termination of a period

of such duty. _See_ R.C.M. 204.

### (b) Offenses under the law of war.

Nothing in this rule limits the power of general courts-martial

to try persons under the law of war. _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(B).

### (c) Attachment of jurisdiction over the person.

#### (1) In general.

Court-martial jurisdiction attaches over a person when action with

a view to trial of that person is taken. Once court-martial jurisdiction

over a person attaches, such jurisdiction shall continue for all purposes

of trial, sentence, and punishment, notwithstanding the expiration of that

person's term of service or other period in which that person was subject

to the code or trial by court-martial. When jurisdiction attaches over a

servicemember on active duty, the servicemember may be held on active duty

over objection pending disposition of any offense for which held and shall

remain subject to the code during the entire period.

##### Discussion

Court-martial jurisdiction exists to try a person as long as that

 person occupies a status as a person subject to the code. _See also

_ Article 104 and 106. Thus, a servicemember is subject to court-martial

jurisdiction until lawfully discharged or, when the servicemember's term of

 service has expired, the government fails to act within a reasonable time

on objection by the servicemember to continued retention.

  Court-martial

jurisdiction attaches over a person upon action with a view to trial. Once

court-martial jurisdiction attaches, it continues throughout the trial and

 appellate process, and for purposes of punishment.

  If jurisdiction

has attached before the effective terminal date of self-executing orders,

the person may be held for trial by court-martial beyond the effective terminal

date.

#### (2) Procedure.

Actions by which court-martial jurisdiction attaches include: apprehension;

imposition of restraint, such as restriction, arrest, or confinement; and

preferral of charges.

## Rule 203. Jurisdiction over the offense

To the extent permitted by the Constitution, courts-martial may

try any offense under the code and, in the case of general courts-martial,

the law of war.

### Discussion

#### (a) In general.

Courts-martial have power to try any offense under the code except

 when prohibited from so doing by the Constitution. The rule enunciated in_

Solorio v. United States_, 483 U.S. 435 (1987) is that jurisdiction

of courts-martial depends solely on the accused's status as a person subject

to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and not on the "service-connection"

of the offense charged.

#### (b) Pleading and proof.

Normally, the inclusion of the accused's rank or grade will be sufficient

to plead the service status of the accused. Ordinarily, no allegation of

the accused's armed force or unit is necessary for military members on active

duty. _See_ R.C.M. 307 regarding required specificity of pleadings.

## Rule 204. Jurisdiction over certain reserve component personnel

### (a) Service regulations.

The Secretary concerned shall prescribe regulations setting forth

 rules and procedures for the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction and nonjudicial

punishment authority over reserve component personnel under Article 2(a)(3)

and 2(d), subject to the limitations of this Manual and the UCMJ.

#### Discussion

Such regulations should describe procedures for ordering a reservist

 to active duty for disciplinary action, for the preferral, investigation,

 forwarding, and referral of charges, designation of convening authorities

and commanders authorized to conduct nonjudicial punishment proceedings,

and for other appropriate purposes.

  _See_ definitions

in R.C.M. 103 (Discussion). _See_ paragraph 5e and f, Part

V, concerning limitations on nonjudicial punishments imposed on reservists

while on inactive-duty training.

  Members of the Army National

Guard and the Air National Guard are subject to Federal court-martial jurisdiction

only when the offense concerned is committed while the member is in Federal

service.

### (b) Courts-Martial

#### (1) General and special court-martial proceedings.

A member of a reserve component must be on active duty prior to

 arraignment at a general or special court-martial. A member ordered to active

duty pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty to serve any

adjudged confinement or other restriction on liberty if the order to active

duty was approved in accordance with Article 2(d)(5), but such member may

not be retained on active duty pursuant to Article 2(d) after service of

the confinement or other restriction on liberty. All punishments remaining

 unserved at the time the member is released from active duty may be carried

over to subsequent periods of inactive-duty training or active duty.

##### Discussion

An accused ordered to active duty pursuant to Article 2(d) may be

 retained on active duty after service of the punishment if permitted by other

authority. For example, an accused who commits another offense while on active

duty ordered pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty pursuant

 to R.C.M. 202(c)(1).

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

A member of a reserve component may be tried by summary court-martial

either while on active duty or inactive-duty training. A summary court-martial

conducted during inactive-duty training may be in session only during normal

periods of such training. The accused may not be held beyond such periods

of training for trial or service or any punishment. All punishments remaining

unserved at the end of a period of active duty or the end of any normal period

of inactive duty training may be carried over to subsequent periods of inactive-duty

training or active duty.

##### Discussion

A "normal period" of inactive-duty training does not

 include periods which are scheduled solely for the purpose of conducting

 court-martial proceedings.

### (c) Applicability.

This subsection is not applicable when a member is held on active

duty pursuant to R.C.M. 202(c).

### (d) Changes in type of service.

A member of a reserve component at the time disciplinary action

is initiated, who is alleged to have committed an offense while on active

duty or inactive-duty training, is subject to court-martial jurisdiction

without regard to any change between active and reserve service or within

 different categories of reserve service subsequent to commission of the offense.

This subsection does not apply to a person whose military status was completely

terminated after commission of an offense.

#### Discussion

A member of a regular or reserve component remains subject to court-martial

jurisdiction after leaving active duty for offenses committed prior to such

termination of active duty if the member retains military status in a reserve

component without having been discharged from all obligations of military

service.

  _See_ R.C.M. 202(a), Discussion,

paragraph (2)(B)(ii) and (iii) regarding the jurisdictional effect of a discharge

from military service. A "complete termination" of military status

refers to a discharge relieving the servicemember of any further military

service. It does not include a discharge conditioned upon acceptance of further

 military service.

# CHAPTER III. INITIATION OF CHARGES; APPREHENSION; PRETRIAL RESTRAINT; RELATED MATTERS

## Rule 301. Report of offense

### (a) Who may report.

Any person may report an offense subject to trial by court-martial.

### (b) To whom reports conveyed for disposition.

Ordinarily, any military authority who receives a report of an

offense shall forward as soon as practicable the report and any accompanying

information to the immediate commander of the suspect. Competent authority

superior to that commander may direct otherwise.

#### Discussion

Any military authority may receive a report of an offense. Typically

 such reports are made to law enforcement or investigative personnel, or to

appropriate persons in the chain of command. A report may be made by any

means, and no particular format is required. When a person who is not a law

enforcement official receives a report of an offense, that person should

forward the report to the immediate commander of the suspect unless that

person believes it would be more appropriate to notify law enforcement or

investigative authorities.

  If the suspect is unidentified,

the military authority who receives the report should refer it to a law enforcement

or investigative agency.

  Upon receipt of a report, the immediate

commander of a suspect should refer to R.C.M. 306 (Initial disposition). _

See also_ R.C.M. 302 (Apprehension); R.C.M. 303 (Preliminary inquiry);

R.C.M. 304, 305 (Pretrial restraint, confinement).

## Rule 302. Apprehension

### (a) Definition and scope.

#### (1) Definition.

Apprehension is the taking of a person into custody.

##### Discussion

Apprehension is the equivalent of "arrest" in civilian

terminology. (In military terminology, "arrest" is a form of

restraint. _ See_ Article 9; R.C.M. 304.) _See_ subsection

(c) of this rule concerning the bases for apprehension. An apprehension is

not required in every case; the fact that an accused was never apprehended

does not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial to try the accused. However, _

 see_ R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction.

  An

apprehension is different from detention of a person for investigative purposes,

although each involves the exercise of government control over the freedom

of movement of a person. An apprehension must be based on probable cause,

and the custody initiated in an apprehension may continue until proper authority

is notified and acts under R.C.M. 304 or 305. An investigative detention may

 be made on less than probable cause (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 314(f)),

and normally involves a relatively short period of custody. Furthermore,

an extensive search of the person is not authorized incident to an investigative

detention, as it is with an apprehension. _See_ Mil. R. Evid.

314(f) and (g). This rule does not affect any seizure of the person less

severe than apprehension.

  Evidence obtained as the result

of an apprehension which is in violation of this rule may be challenged under

Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1). Evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful civilian

arrest may be challenged under Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1), (2).

#### (2) Scope.

This rule applies only to apprehensions made by persons authorized

to do so under subsection (b) of this rule with respect to offenses subject

to trial by court-martial. Nothing in this rule limits the authority of federal

law enforcement officials to apprehend persons, whether or not subject to

trial by court-martial, to the extent permitted by applicable enabling statutes

and other law.

##### Discussion

R.C.M. 302 does not affect the authority of any official to detain,

 arrest, or apprehend persons not subject to trial under the code. The rule

does not apply to actions taken by any person in a private capacity.

  Several

federal agencies have broad powers to apprehend persons for violations of

federal laws, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For example,

agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Marshals, and

agents of the Secret Service may apprehend persons for any offenses committed

in their presence and for felonies. 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3052, 3053, 3056.

 Other agencies have apprehension powers include the General Services Administration,

40 U.S.C. &sect; 318 and the Veterans Administration, 38 U.S.C. &sect; 218.

The extent to which such agencies become involved in the apprehension of

persons subject to trial by courts-martial may depend on the statutory authority

of the agency and the agency's formal or informal relationships with the

Department of Defense.

### (b) Who may apprehend.

The following officials may apprehend any person subject to trial

by court-martial:

#### (1) Military law enforcement officials.

Security police, military police, master at arms personnel, members

 of the shore patrol, and persons designated by proper authorities to perform

military criminal investigative, guard, or police duties, whether subject

to the code or not, when in each of the foregoing instances, the official

making the apprehension is in the execution of law enforcement duties;

##### Discussion

Whenever enlisted persons, including police and guards, and civilian

police and guards apprehend any commissioned or warrant officer, such persons

should make an immediate report to the commissioned officer to whom the apprehending

person is responsible.

  The phrase "persons designated

by proper authority to perform military criminal investigative, guard or

police duties" includes special agents of the Defense Criminal Investigative

Service.

#### (2) Commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers.

All commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers on

active duty or inactive duty training;

##### Discussion

Noncommissioned and petty officers not otherwise performing law

 enforcement duties should not apprehend a commissioned officer unless directed

to do so by a commissioned officer or in order to prevent disgrace to the

service or the escape of one who has committed a serious offense.

#### (3) Civilians authorized to apprehend deserters.

Under Article 8, any civilian officer having authority to apprehend

 offenders under laws of the United States or of a State, Territory, Commonwealth,

or possession, or the District of Columbia, when the apprehension is of a

deserter from the armed forces.

##### Discussion

The code specifically provides that any civil officer, whether of

a State, Territory, district, or of the United States may apprehend any deserter. However,

this authority does not permit state and local law enforcement officers to

apprehend persons for other violations of the code. _ See_ Article

8.

### (c) Grounds for apprehension.

A person subject to the code or trial thereunder may be apprehended

 for an offense triable by court-martial upon probable cause to apprehend.

 Probable cause to apprehend exists when there are reasonable grounds to believe

that an offense has been or is being committed and the person to be apprehended

committed or is committing it. Persons authorized to apprehend under subsection

(b)(2) of this rule may also apprehend persons subject to the code who take

part in quarrels, frays, or disorders, wherever they occur.

#### Discussion

"Reasonable grounds" means that there must be the kind

of reliable information that a reasonable, prudent person would rely on which

makes it more likely than not that something is true. A mere suspicion is

not enough but proof which would support a conviction is not necessary. A

person who determines probable cause may rely on the reports of others.

### (d) How an apprehension may be made.

#### (1) In general.

An apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person to be apprehended

that person is in custody. This notice should be given orally or in writing,

but it may be implied by the circumstances.

#### (2) Warrants.

Neither warrants nor any other authorization shall be required for

an apprehension under these rules except as required in subsection (e)(2)

of this rule.

#### (3) Use of force.

Any person authorized under these rules to make an apprehension

may use such force and means as reasonably necessary under the circumstances

to effect the apprehension.

##### Discussion

In addition to any other action required by law or regulation or

 proper military officials, any person making an apprehension under these

rules should maintain custody of the person apprehended and inform as promptly

as possible the immediate commander of the person apprehended, or any official

higher in the chain of command of the person apprehended if it is impractical

 to inform the immediate commander.

### (e) Where an apprehension may be made.

#### (1) In general.

An apprehension may be made at any place, except as provided in

subsection (e)(2) of this rule.

#### (2) Private dwellings.

A private dwelling includes dwellings, on or off a military installation,

such as single family houses, duplexes, and apartments. The quarters may be

owned, leased, or rented by the residents, or assigned, and may be occupied

on a temporary or permanent basis. "Private dwelling" does not

include the following, whether or not subdivided into individual units: living

areas in military barracks, vessels, aircraft, vehicles, tents, bunkers,

field encampments, and similar places. No person may enter a private dwelling

for the purpose of making an apprehension under these rules unless:

(A) Pursuant to consent under Mil. R. Evid. 314(e) or 316(d)(2);

(B) Under exigent circumstances described in Mil. R. Evid. 315(g) or

316(d)(4)(B);

(C) In the case of a private dwelling which is military property or

under military control, or nonmilitary property in a foreign country

(i) if the person to be apprehended is a resident of the private dwelling,

there exists, at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the person

to be apprehended is present in the dwelling, and the apprehension has been

authorized by an official listed in Mil. R. Evid. 315(d) upon a determination

that probable cause to apprehend the person exists; or

(ii) if the person to be apprehended is not a resident of the private

 dwelling, the entry has been authorized by an official listed in Mil. R.

Evid. 315(d) upon a determination that probable cause exists to apprehend

the person and to believe that the person to be apprehended is or will be

 present at the time of the entry;

(D) In the case of a private dwelling not included in subsection (e)(2)(C)

of this rule,

(i) if the person to be apprehended is a resident of the private dwelling,

there exists at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the person to

be apprehended is present and the apprehension is authorized by an arrest

warrant issued by competent civilian authority; or

(ii) if the person to be apprehended is not a resident of the private

 dwelling, the apprehension is authorized by an arrest warrant and the entry

is authorized by a search warrant, each issued by competent civilian authority. A

person who is not a resident of the private dwelling entered may not challenge

the legality of an apprehension of that person on the basis of failure to

secure a warrant or authorization to enter that dwelling, or on the basis

of the sufficiency of such a warrant or authorization. Nothing in this subsection

((e)(2)) affects the legality of an apprehension which is incident to otherwise

lawful presence in a private dwelling.

####### Discussion

For example, if law enforcement officials enter a private dwelling

pursuant to a valid search warrant or search authorization, they may apprehend

persons therein if grounds for an apprehension exist. This subsection is not

 intended to be an independent grant of authority to execute civilian arrest

or search warrants. The authority must derive from an appropriate Federal

or state procedure. _See e.g._ Fed. R. Crim. P. 41 and 28 C.F.R.

60.1.

## Rule 303. Preliminary inquiry into reported offenses

Upon receipt of information that a member of the command is accused

or suspected of committing an offense or offenses triable by court-martial,

the immediate commander shall make or cause to be made a preliminary inquiry

into the charges or suspected offenses.

### Discussion

The preliminary inquiry is usually informal. It may be an examination

of the charges and an investigative report or other summary of expected evidence.

In other cases a more extensive investigation may be necessary. Although

the commander may conduct the investigation personally or with members of

the command, in serious or complex cases the commander should consider whether

to seek the assistance of law enforcement personnel in conducting any inquiry

or further investigation. The inquiry should gather all reasonably available

evidence bearing on guilt or innocence and any evidence relating to aggravation,

extenuation, or mitigation.

  The Military Rules of Evidence

should be consulted when conducting interrogations (_see_

Mil. R. Evid. 301-306), searches (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 311-317),

and eyewitness identifications (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 321).

  If

the offense is one for which the Department of Justice has investigative responsibilities,

 appropriate coordination should be made under the Memorandum of Understanding,_

see_ Appendix 3, and any implementing regulations.

  If

it appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings in

the case, this should be brought to the attention of appropriate authorities. _

See also_ R.C.M. 702 (depositions).

  A person who

is an accuser (_see_ Article 1(9)) is disqualified from convening

 a general or special court-martial in that case. R.C.M. 504(c)(1). Therefore,

when the immediate commander is a general or special court-martial convening

authority, the preliminary inquiry should be conducted by another officer

of the command. That officer may be informed that charges may be preferred

if the officer determines that preferral is warranted.

## Rule 304. Pretrial restraint

### (a) Types of pretrial restraint.

Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a person's

liberty which is imposed before and during disposition of offenses. Pretrial

restraint may consist of conditions on liberty, restriction in lieu of arrest,

 arrest, or confinement.

#### (1) Conditions on liberty.

Conditions on liberty are imposed by orders directing a person to

do or refrain from doing specified acts. Such conditions may be imposed in

conjunction with other forms of restraint or separately.

#### (2) Restriction in lieu of arrest.

Restriction in lieu of arrest is the restraint of a person by oral

or written orders directing the person to remain within specified limits;

a restricted person shall, unless otherwise directed, perform full military

duties while restricted.

#### (3) Arrest.

Arrest is the restraint of a person by oral or written order not

imposed as punishment, directing the person to remain within specified limits;

a person in the status of arrest may not be required to perform full military

duties such as commanding or supervising personnel, serving as guard, or bearing

arms. The status of arrest automatically ends when the person is placed,

by the authority who ordered the arrest or a superior authority, on duty

inconsistent with the status of arrest, but this shall not prevent requiring

the person arrested to do ordinary cleaning or policing, or to take part

in routine training and duties.

#### (4) Confinement.

Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order of

competent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of

offenses. _See_ R.C.M. 305.

##### Discussion

Conditions on liberty include orders to report periodically to a

specified official, orders not to go to a certain place (such as the scene

of the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with specified persons

(such as the alleged victim or potential witnesses). Conditions on liberty

must not hinder pretrial preparation, however. Thus, when such conditions

are imposed, they must by sufficiently flexible to permit pretrial preparation.

  Restriction

in lieu of arrest is a less severe restraint on liberty than is arrest. Arrest

 includes suspension from performing full military duties and the limits of

arrest are normally narrower than those of restriction in lieu of arrest.

The actual nature of the restraint imposed, and not the characterization

of it by the officer imposing it, will determine whether it is technically

an arrest or restriction in lieu of arrest.

  Breach of arrest

or restriction in lieu of arrest or violation of conditions on liberty are

offenses under the code. _See_ paragraphs 16, 19, and 102,

 Part IV. When such an offense occurs, it may warrant appropriate action such

as nonjudicial punishment or court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 306.

In addition, such a breach or violation may provide a basis for the imposition

of a more severe form of restraint.

  R.C.M. 707(a) requires

that the accused be brought to trial within 120 days of preferral of charges

or imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4).

### (b) Who may order pretrial restraint.

#### (1) Of civilians and officers.

Only a commanding officer to whose authority the civilian or officer

is subject may order pretrial restraint of that civilian or officer.

##### Discussion

Civilians may be restrained under these rules only when they are

subject to trial by court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 202.

#### (2) Of enlisted persons.

Any commissioned officer may order pretrial restraint of any enlisted

person.

#### (3) Delegation of authority.

The authority to order pretrial restraint of civilians and commissioned

and warrant officers may not be delegated. A commanding officer may delegate

to warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers authority to order pretrial

restraint of enlisted persons of the commanding officer's command or subject

to the authority of that commanding officer.

#### (4) Authority to withhold.

A superior competent authority may withhold from a subordinate the

 authority to order pretrial restraint.

### (c) When a person may be restrained.

No person may be ordered into restraint before trial except for

probable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial restraint exists when there

is a reasonable belief that:

(1) An offense triable by court-martial has been committed;

(2) The person to be restrained committed it; and

(3) The restraint ordered is required by the circumstances.

##### Discussion

The decision whether to impose pretrial restraint, and, if so, what

type or types, should be made on a case-by-case basis. The factors listed

in the Discussion of R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B) should be considered. The restraint

should not be more rigorous than the circumstances require to ensure the

presence of the person restrained or to prevent foreseeable serious criminal

misconduct.

  Restraint is not required in every case. The

absence of pretrial restraint does not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial.

However, _see_ R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction. _

See_ R.C.M. 305 concerning the standards and procedures governing

pretrial confinement.

### (d) Procedures for ordering pretrial restraint.

Pretrial restraint other than confinement is imposed by notifying

the person orally or in writing of the restraint, including its terms or

limits. The order to an enlisted person shall be delivered personally by

the authority who issues it or through other persons subject to the code.

The order to an officer or a civilian shall be delivered personally by the

authority who issues it or by another commissioned officer. Pretrial confinement

is imposed pursuant to orders by a competent authority by the delivery of

a person to a place of confinement.

### (e) Notice of basis for restraint.

When a person is placed under restraint, the person shall be informed

of the nature of the offense which is the basis for such restraint.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 305(e) concerning additional information

which must be given to a person who is confined. If the person ordering the

restrain is not the commander of the person restrained, that officer should

be notified.

### (f) Punishment prohibited.

Pretrial restraint is not punishment and shall not be used as such.

 No person who is restrained pending trial may be subjected to punishment

or penalty for the offense which is the basis for that restraint. Prisoners

being held for trial shall not be required to undergo punitive duty hours

or training, perform punitive labor, or wear special uniforms prescribed

only for post-trial prisoners. This rule does not prohibit minor punishment

during pretrial confinement for infractions of the rules of the place of confinement.

Prisoners shall be afforded facilities and treatment under regulations of

the Secretary concerned.

#### Discussion

Offenses under the code by a person under restraint may be disposed

 of in the same manner as any other offenses.

### (g) Release.

Except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 305, a person may be released

 from pretrial restraint by a person authorized to impose it. Pretrial restraint

shall terminate when a sentence is adjudged, the accused is acquitted of

all charges, or all charges are dismissed.

#### Discussion

Pretrial restraint may be imposed (or reimposed) if charges are

to be reinstated or a rehearing or "other" trial is to be

ordered.

### (h) Administrative restraint.

Nothing in this rule prohibits limitations on a servicemember imposed

 for operational or other military purposes independent of military justice,

including administrative hold or medical reasons.

#### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 306.

## Rule 305. Pretrial confinement

### (a) In general.

Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order of

 competent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of

 charges.

#### Discussion

No member of the armed forces may be placed in confinement in immediate

association with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not members of

the armed forces of the United States. Article 12. However, if members of

the armed forces of the United States are separated from prisoners of the

other categories mentioned, they may be confined in the same confinement

facilities.

### (b) Who may be confined.

Any person who is subject to trial by court-martial may be confined

 if the requirements of this rule are met.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 201 and 202 and the discussions therein

concerning persons who are subject to trial by courts-martial.

### (c) Who may order confinement.

_See_ R.C.M. 304(b).

#### Discussion

"No provost marshal, commander of a guard, or master at arms

 may refuse to receive or keep any prisoner committed to his charge by a

commissioned officer of the armed forces, when the committing officer furnishes

 a statement, signed by him, of the offense charged against the prisoner."

 Article 11(a).

### (d) When a person may be confined.

No person may be ordered into pretrial confinement except for probable

cause. Probable cause to order pretrial confinement exists when there is

a reasonable belief that:

(1) An offense triable by court-martial has been committed;

(2) The person confined committed it; and

(3) Confinement is required by the circumstances.

##### Discussion

The person who directs confinement should consider the matters

discussed under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule before ordering confinement.

 However, the person who initially orders confinement is not required to make

a detailed analysis of the necessity for confinement. It is often not possible

to review a person's background and character or even the details of an offense

 before physically detaining the person. For example, until additional information

can be secured, it may be necessary to confine a person apprehended in the

course of a violent crime.

  "[W]hen

charged only with an offense normally tried by summary court-martial, [an

accused] shall not ordinarily be paced in confinement." Article

10.

  Confinement should be distinguished from custody. Custody

 is restraint which is imposed by apprehension and which may be, but is not

 necessarily, physical. Custody may be imposed by anyone authorized to apprehend

(_see_ R.C.M. 302(b)), and may continue until a proper authority

under R.C.M. 304(B) is notified and takes action. Thus, a person who has

been apprehended could be physically restrained, but this would not be pretrial

confinement in the sense of this rule until a person authorized to do so

under R.C.M. 304(b) directed confinement.

### (e) Advice to the accused upon confinement.

Each person confined shall be promptly informed of:

(1) The nature of the offenses for which held;

(2) The right to remain silent and that any statement made by the person

may be used against the person;

(3) The right to retain civilian counsel at no expense to the United

States, and the right to request assignment of military counsel; and

(4) The procedures by which pretrial confinement will be reviewed.

### (f) Military counsel.

If requested by the prisoner and such request is made known to

military authorities, military counsel shall be provided to the prisoner before

the initial review under subsection (i) of this rule or within 72 hours of

such a request being first communicated to military authorities, whichever

occurs first. Counsel may be assigned for the limited purpose of representing

the accused only during the pretrial confinement proceedings before charges

are referred. If assignment is made for this limited purpose, the prisoner

shall be so informed. Unless otherwise provided by regulations of the Secretary

concerned, a prisoner does not have a right under this rule to have military

counsel of the prisoner's own selection.

### (g) Who may direct release from confinement.

Any commander of a prisoner, an officer appointed under regulations

 of the Secretary concerned to conduct the review under subsection (i) and/or

 (j) of this rule, or, once charges have been referred, a military judge

detailed to the court-martial to which the charges against the accused have

been referred, may direct release from pretrial confinement. For purposes

of this subsection, "any commander" includes the immediate or

higher commander of the prisoner and the commander of the installation on

which the confinement facility is located.

### (h) Notification and action by commander.

#### (1) Report.

Unless the commander of the prisoner ordered the pretrial confinement,

the commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer into whose charge

the prisoner was committed shall, within 24 hours after that commitment,

cause a report to be made to the commander that shall contain the name of

the prisoner, the offenses charged against the prisoner, and the name of

the person who ordered or authorized confinement.

##### Discussion

This report may be made by any means. Ordinarily, the immediate

 commander of the prisoner should be notified. In unusual cases any commander

to whose authority the prisoner is subject, such as the commander of the

 confinement facility, may be notified. In the latter case, the commander

so notified must ensure compliance with subsection (h)(2) of this rule.

#### (2) Action by commander.

##### (A) Decision.

Not later than 72 hours after the commander's ordering of a prisoner

 into pretrial confinement or, after receipt of a report that a member of

the commander's unit or organization has been confined, whichever situation

is applicable, the commander shall decide whether pretrial confinement will

continue. A commander's compliance with this subsection may also satisfy

the 48-hour probable cause determination of subsection R.C.M. 305(i)(1) below,

provided the commander is a neutral and detached officer and acts within

48 hours of the imposition of confinement under military control. Nothing

in subsections R.C.M. 305(d), R.C.M. 305(i)(1), or this subsection prevents

a neutral and detached commander from completing the 48-hour probable cause

determination and the 72-hour commander's decision immediately after an accused

is ordered into pretrial confinement.

##### (B) Requirements for confinement.

The commander shall direct the prisoner's release from pretrial

 confinement unless the commander believes upon probable cause, that is, upon

 reasonable grounds, that:

(i) An offense triable by a court-martial has been committed;

(ii) The prisoner committed it; and

(iii) Confinement is necessary because it is foreseeable that:

(a) The prisoner will not appear at trial, pretrial hearing, or investigation,

or

(b) The prisoner will engage in serious criminal misconduct; and

(iv) Less severe forms of restraint are inadequate.

 Serious

criminal misconduct includes intimidation of witnesses or other obstruction

of justice, serious injury of others, or other offenses which pose a serious

threat to the safety of the community or to the effectiveness, morale, discipline,

readiness, or safety of the command, or to the national security of the United

States. As used in this rule, "national security" means the national

defense and foreign relations of the United States and specifically includes:

a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations;

a favorable foreign relations position; or a defense posture capable of successfully

resisting hostile or destructive action from within or without, overt or

covert.

####### Discussion

A person should not be confined as a mere matter of convenience

or expedience.

  Some of the factors which should be considered

under this subsection are:

The nature and circumstances of the offenses charged or

 suspected, including extenuating circumstances;

The weight of the evidence against the accused;

The accused's ties to the locale, including family, off-duty

 employment, financial resources, and length of residence;

The accused's character and mental condition;

The accused's service record, including any record of previous

misconduct;

The accused's record of appearance at or flight from other

 pretrial investigations, trials, and similar proceedings; and

The likelihood that the accused can and will commit further

 serious criminal misconduct if allowed to remain at liberty.



  Although the Military Rules of Evidence are not

applicable, the commander should judge the reliability of the information

available. Before relying on the reports of others, the commander must have

a reasonable belief that the information is believable and has a factual basis.

 The information may be received orally or in writing. Information need not

be received under oath, but an oath may add to its reliability. A commander

may examine the prisoner's personnel records, police records, and may consider

the recommendations of others.

  Less serious forms of restraint

must always be considered before pretrial confinement may be approved. Thus

the commander should consider whether the prisoner could be safely returned

to the prisoner's unit, at liberty or under restriction, arrest, or conditions

on liberty. _See_ R.C.M. 304.

##### (C) 72-hour memorandum.

If continued pretrial confinement is approved, the commander shall

 prepare a written memorandum that states the reasons for the conclusion that

the requirements for confinement in subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule have

been met. This memorandum may include hearsay and may incorporate by reference

other documents, such as witness statements, investigative reports, or official

records. This memorandum shall be forwarded to the 7-day reviewing officer

under subsection (i)(2) of this rule. If such a memorandum was prepared by

the commander before ordering confinement, a second memorandum need not be

 prepared; however, additional information may be added to the memorandum

at any time.

### (i) Procedures for review of pretrial confinement.

#### (1) 48-hour probable cause determination.

Review of the adequacy of probable cause to continue pretrial confinement

shall be made by a neutral and detached officer within 48 hours of imposition

of confinement under military control. If the prisoner is apprehended by

civilian authorities and remains in civilian custody at the request of military

authorities, reasonable efforts will be made to bring the prisoner under

military control in a timely fashion.

#### (2) 7-day review of pretrial confinement.

Within 7 days of the imposition of confinement, a neutral and detached

officer appointed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary

concerned shall review the probable cause determination and necessity for

continued pretrial confinement. In calculating the number of days of confinement

for purposes of this rule, the initial date of confinement under military

control shall count as one day and the date of the review shall also count

as one day.

##### (A) Nature of the 7-day review.

###### (i) Matters considered.

The review under this subsection shall include a review of the memorandum submitted by the prisoner's commander under subsection (h)(2)(C) of this rule. Additional written matters may be considered, including any submitted by the prisoner. The prisoner and the prisoner's counsel, if any, shall be allowed to appear before the 7-day reviewing officer and make a statement, if practicable. A representative of the command may also appear before the reviewing officer to make a statement.

###### (ii) Rules of evidence.

Except for Mil. R. Evid., Section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid.

302 and 305, the Military Rules of Evidence shall not apply to the matters

considered.

###### (iii) Standard of proof.

The requirements for confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this

 rule must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.

###### (iv) Victim's right to be reasonably heard.

A victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the 7-day review; the right to confer with the representative of the command and counsel for the government, if any, and the right to be reasonably heard during the review. However, the hearing may not be unduly delayed for this purpose. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel. The victim of an alleged offense shall be notified of these rights in accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

####### Discussion

 Personal appearance by the victim is not required. A victim's right to be reasonably heard at a 7-day review may also be accomplished telephonically, by video teleconference, or by written statement.

##### (B) Extension of time limit.

The 7-day reviewing officer may, for good cause, extend the time

limit for completion of the review to 10 days after the imposition of pretrial

confinement.

##### (C) Action by 7-day reviewing officer.

Upon completion of review, the reviewing officer shall approve continued confinement or order immediate release. If the reviewing officer orders immediate release, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the release, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.

##### (D) Memorandum.

The 7-day reviewing officer's conclusions, including the factual findings on which they are based, shall be set forth in a written memorandum. The memorandum shall also state whether the victim was notified of the review, was given the opportunity to confer with the representative of the command or counsel for the government, and was given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. A copy of the memorandum and all documents considered by the 7-day reviewing officer shall be maintained in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned and provided to the accused or the Government on request.

##### (E) Reconsideration of approval of continued confinement.

The 7-day reviewing officer shall upon request, and after notice

to the parties, reconsider the decision to confine the prisoner based upon

any significant information not previously considered.

### (j) Review by military judge.

Once the charges for which the accused has been confined are referred

to trial, the military judge shall review the propriety of pretrial confinement

upon motion for appropriate relief.

#### (1) Release.

 The military judge shall order release from pretrial confinement

only if:

(A) The 7-day reviewing officer's decision was an abuse of discretion,

and there is not sufficient information presented to the military judge justifying

continuation of pretrial confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule;

(B) Information not presented to the 7-day reviewing officer establishes

 that the prisoner should be released under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule;

 or

(C) The provisions of subsection (i)(1) or (2) of this rule have not

been complied with and information presented to the military judge does not

establish sufficient grounds for continued confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B)

of this rule.

###### Discussion

 Upon a motion for release from pretrial confinement, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the motion and any hearing, the right to confer with counsel representing the government, and the right to be reasonably heard. Inability to reasonably afford a victim these rights shall not delay the proceedings. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(8).

#### (2) Credit.

The military judge shall order administrative credit under subsection

(k) of this rule for any pretrial confinement served as a result of an abuse

of discretion or failure to comply with the provisions of subsections (f),

(h), or (i) of this rule.

### (k) Remedy.

The remedy for noncompliance with subsections (f), (h), (i), or

(j) of this rule shall be an administrative credit against the sentence adjudged

for any confinement served as the result of such noncompliance. Such credit

shall be computed at the rate of 1 day credit for each day of confinement

served as a result of such noncompliance. The military judge may order additional

credit for each day of pretrial confinement that involves an abuse of discretion

or unusually harsh circumstances. This credit is to be applied in addition

to any other credit the accused may be entitled as a result of pretrial confinement

served. This credit shall be applied first against any confinement adjudged.

If no confinement is adjudged, or if the confinement adjudged is insufficient

 to offset all the credit to which the accused is entitled, the credit shall

be applied against hard labor without confinement, restriction, fine, and

forfeiture of pay, in that order, using the conversion formula under R.C.M.

 1003(b)(6) and (7). For purposes of this subsection, 1 day of confinement

shall be equal to 1 day of total forfeiture or a like amount of fine. The

credit shall not be applied against any other form of punishment.

### (l) Confinement after release.

No person whose release from pretrial confinement has been directed

 by a person authorized in subsection (g) of this rule may be confined again

 before completion of trial except upon the discovery, after the order of

 release, of evidence or of misconduct which, either alone or in conjunction

 with all other available evidence, justifies confinement.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 304(b) concerning who may order confinement.

### (m) Exceptions.

#### (1) Operational necessity.

The Secretary of Defense may suspend application of subsections

 (e)(2) and (3), (f), (h)(2)(A) and (C), and (i) of this rule to specific

units or in specified areas when operational requirements of such units or

 in such areas would make application of such provisions impracticable.

#### (2) At sea.

Subsections (e)(2) and (3), (f), (h)(2)(C), and (i) of this rule

shall not apply in the case of a person on board a vessel at sea. In such

situations, confinement on board the vessel at sea may continue only until

the person can be transferred to a confinement facility ashore. Such transfer

shall be accomplished at the earliest opportunity permitted by the operational

requirements and mission of the vessel. Upon such transfer the memorandum

required by subsection (h)(2)(C) of this rule shall be transmitted to the

reviewing officer under subsection (i) of this rule and shall include an

explanation of any delay in the transfer.

### (n) Notice to victim of escaped prisoner.

A victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner for which the prisoner has been placed in pretrial confinement has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the escape of the prisoner, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.

#### Discussion

 For purposes of this rule, the term "victim of an alleged offense" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ.

#### Discussion

Under this subsection the standards for confinement remain the same

 (although the circumstances giving rise to the exception could bear on the

application of those standards). Also, pretrial confinement remains subject

to judicial review. The prisoner's commander still must determine whether

confinement will continue under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule. The suspension

of subsection (h)(2)(A) of this rule removes the 72-hour requirement since

in a combat environment, the commander may not be available to comply with

it. The commander must make the pretrial confinement decision as soon as

reasonably possible, however. (This provision is not suspended under subsection

(2) since the commander of a vessel is always available.)

## Rule 306. Initial disposition

### (a) Who may dispose of offenses.

Each commander has discretion to dispose of offenses by members

of that command. Ordinarily the immediate commander of a person accused or

suspected of committing an offense triable by court-martial initially determines

how to dispose of that offense. A superior commander may withhold the authority

to dispose of offenses in individual cases, types of cases, or generally.

A superior commander may not limit the discretion of a subordinate commander

to act on cases over which authority has not been withheld.

#### Discussion

Each commander in the chain of command has independent, yet overlapping

discretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that officer's authority.

Normally, in keeping with the policy in subsection (b) of this rule, the initial

disposition decision is made by the official at the lowest echelon with the

power to make it. A decision by a commander ordinarily does not bar a different

disposition by a superior authority. _See_ R.C.M. 401(c); 601(f).

Once charges are referred to a court-martial by a convening authority competent

to do so, they may be withdrawn from that court-martial only in accordance

with R.C.M. 604.

  _See_ Appendix 3 with respect

to offenses for which coordination with the Department of Justice is required.

### (b) Policy.

Allegations of offenses should be disposed of in a timely manner

at the lowest appropriate level of disposition listed in subsection (c) of

this rule.

#### Discussion

The disposition decision is one of the most important and difficult decisions facing a commander. Many factors must be taken into consideration and balanced, including, to the extent practicable, the nature of the offenses, any mitigating or extenuating circumstances, the views of the victim as to disposition, any recommendations made by subordinate commanders, the interest of justice, military exigencies, and the effect of the decision on the accused and the command. The goal should be a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair.

  In deciding how an offense should be disposed of, factors the commander should consider, to the extent they are known, include:

  (A) the nature of and circumstances surrounding the offense and the extent of the harm caused by the offense, including the offense's effect on morale, health, safety, welfare, and discipline;

  (B) when applicable, the views of the victim as to disposition;

  (C) existence of jurisdiction over the accused and the offense;

  (D) availability and admissibility of evidence;

  (E) the willingness of the victim or others to testify;

  (F) cooperation of the accused in the apprehension or prosecution of another accused;

  (G) possible improper motives or biases of the person(s) making the allegation(s);

  (H) availability and likelihood of prosecution of the same or similar and related charges against the accused by another jurisdiction;

  (I) appropriateness of the authorized punishment to the particular accused or offense.

### (c) How offenses may be disposed of.

Within the limits of the commander's authority, a commander may

take the actions set forth in this subsection to initially dispose of a charge

or suspected offense.

#### Discussion

Prompt disposition of charges is essential. _See_ R.C.M.

707 (speedy trial requirements).

  Before determining an appropriate

disposition, a commander should ensure that a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M.

303 has been conducted. If charges have not already been preferred, the commander

may, if appropriate, prefer them and dispose of them under this rule. _

But see_ R.C.M. 601 (c) regarding disqualification of an accuser.

  If

charges have been preferred, the commander should ensure that the accused

has been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308, and that charges are in proper

form. _ See_ R.C.M. 307. Each commander who forwards or disposes

of charges may make minor changes therein. _See_ R.C.M. 603(a)

and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge should be preferred

anew. _See_ R.C.M. 603(d).

  When charges are

brought against two or more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, _

see_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3). If it appears that the accused

may lack mental capacity to stand trial or may not have been mentally responsible

at the times of the offenses, _see_ R.C.M. 706; 909; 916(k).

#### (1) No action.

A commander may decide to take no action on an offense. If charges

 have been preferred, they may be dismissed.

##### Discussion

A decision to take no action or dismissal of charges at this stage

 does not bar later disposition of the offenses under subsection (c)(2) through

 (5) of this rule.

  _See_ R.C.M. 401(a) concerning

who may dismiss charges, and R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges.

  When

a decision is made to take no action, the accused should be informed.

#### (2) Administrative action.

A commander may take or initiate administrative action, in addition

 to or instead of other action taken under this rule, subject to regulations

of the Secretary concerned. Administrative actions include corrective measures

such as counseling, admonition, reprimand, exhortation, disapproval, criticism,

censure, reproach, rebuke, extra military instruction, or the administrative

withholding of privileges, or any combination of the above.

##### Discussion

Other administrative measures, which are subject to regulations

of the Secretary concerned, include matters related to efficiency reports,

academic reports, and other ratings; rehabilitation and reassignment; career

field reclassification; administrative reduction for inefficiency; bar to

reenlistment; personnel reliability program reclassification; security classification

changes; pecuniary liability for negligence or misconduct; and administrative

separation.

#### (3) Nonjudicial punishment.

A commander may consider the matter pursuant to Article 15, nonjudicial

punishment. _See_ Part V.

#### (4) Disposition of charges.

Charges may be disposed of in accordance with R.C.M. 401.

##### Discussion

If charges have not been preferred, they may be preferred. _

See_ R.C.M. 307 concerning preferral of charges. However, _

see_ R.C.M. 601(c) concerning disqualification of an accuser.

  Charges

may be disposed of by dismissing them, forwarding them to another commander

for disposition, or referring them to a summary, special, or general court-martial.

Before charges may be referred to a general court-martial, compliance with

R.C.M. 405 and 406 is necessary. Therefore, if appropriate, an investigation

 under R.C.M. 405 may be directed. Additional guidance on these matters is

found in R.C.M. 401-407.

#### (5) Forwarding for disposition.

A commander may forward a matter concerning an offense, or charges,

to a superior or subordinate authority for disposition.

##### Discussion

The immediate commander may lack authority to take action which

that commander believes is an appropriate disposition. In such cases, the

matter should be forwarded to a superior officer with a recommendation as

to disposition. _See also_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2) concerning forwarding

charges. If allegations are forwarded to a higher authority for disposition,

because of lack of authority or otherwise, the disposition decision becomes

 a matter within the discretion of the higher authority.

  A

matter may be forwarded for other reasons, such as for investigation of allegations

and preferral of charges, if warranted (_see_ R.C.M. 303, 307), or so that a subordinate can dispose of the matter.

### (d) National security matters.

If a commander not authorized to convene general courts-martial

finds that an offense warrants trial by court-martial, but believes that

trial would be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to national

security, the matter shall be forwarded to the general court-martial convening

authority for action under R.C.M. 407(b).

## Rule 307. Preferral of charges

### (a) Who may prefer charges.

Any person subject to the code may prefer charges.

#### Discussion

No person may be ordered to prefer charges to which that person

is unable to make truthfully the required oath. _See_ Article

30(a) and subsection (b) of this rule. A person who has been the accuser

or nominal accuser (_see_ Article 1(9)) may not also serve

as the convening authority of a general or special court-martial to which

the charges are later referred. _See_ Articles 22(b) and 23(b);

R.C.M. 601; however, _see_ R.C.M. 1302(b) (summary court-martial

convening authority is not disqualified by being the accuser). A person authorized

to dispose of offenses (_see_ R.C.M. 306(a); 401-404

and 407) should not be ordered to prefer charges when this would disqualify

that person from exercising that person's authority or would improperly restrict

that person's discretion to act on the case. _See_ R.C.M.

104 and 504(c).

  Charges may be preferred against a person

subject to trial by court-martial at any time but should be preferred without

unnecessary delay. _See_ the statute of limitations prescribed

by Article 43. Preferral of charges should not be unnecessarily delayed.

When a good reason exists-as when a person is permitted to continue

a course of conduct so that a ringleader or other conspirators may also be

discovered or when a suspected counterfeiter goes uncharged until guilty

knowledge becomes apparent-a reasonable delay is permissible. However, _

see_ R.C.M. 707 concerning speedy trial requirements.

### (b) How charges are preferred; oath.

A person who prefers charges must:

(1) Sign the charges and specifications under oath before a commissioned

 officer of the armed forces authorized to administer oaths; and

(2) State that the signer has personal knowledge of or has investigated

 the matters set forth in the charges and specifications and that they are

true in fact to the best of that person's knowledge and belief.

##### Discussion

_See_ Article 136 for authority to administer oaths.

The following form may be used to administer the oath:

  "You (swear) (affirm) that you are a person subject

 to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, that you have personal knowledge

of or have investigated the matters set forth in the foregoing charge(s)

and specification(s), and that the same are true in fact to the best of your

 knowledge and belief. (So help you God.)"



  The accuser's belief may be based upon reports

of others in whole or in part.

### (c) How to allege offenses.

#### (1) In general.

The format of charge and specification is used to allege violations

of the code.

##### Discussion

_See_ Appendix 4 for a sample of a Charge Sheet (DD

Form 458).

#### (2) Charge.

A charge states the article of the code, law of war, or local penal

law of an occupied territory which the accused is alleged to have violated.

##### Discussion

The particular subdivision of an article of the code (for example,

Article 118(1)) should not be included in the charge. When there are numerous

infractions of the same article, there will be only one charge, but several

specifications thereunder. There may also be several charges, but each must

allege a violation of a different article of the code. For violations of

the law of war, _see_ (D) below.

###### (A) Numbering charges.

If there is only one charge, it is not numbered. When there is

more than one charge, each charge is numbered by a Roman numeral.

###### (B) Additional charges.

Charges preferred after others have been preferred are labeled "additional

charges" and are also numbered with Roman numerals, beginning with

"I" if there is more than one additional charge. These ordinarily

relate to offenses not known at the time or committed after the original

charges were preferred. Additional charges do not require a separate trial

 if incorporated in the trial of the original charges before arraignment. _

See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2).

###### (C) Preemption.

An offense specifically defined by Articles 81 through 132 may not

be alleged as a violation of Article 134. _See_ paragraph

60c(5)(a) of Part IV. _But see_ subsection (d) of this rule.

###### (D) Charges under the law of war.

In the case of a person subject to trial by general court-martial

for violations of the law of war (_see_ Article 18), the charge

should be: "Violation of the Law of War"; or "Violation

of , " referring to

the local penal law of the occupied territory. _See_ R.C.M.

201(f)(1)(B). _But see_ subsection (d) of this rule. Ordinarily

persons subject to the code should be charged with a specific violation of

the code rather than a violation of the law of war.

#### (3) Specification.

A specification is a plain, concise, and definite statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. A specification is sufficient if it alleges every element of the charged offense expressly or by necessary implication; however, specifications under Article 134 must expressly allege the terminal element. Except for aggravating factors under R.C.M 1003(d) and R.C.M. 1004, facts that increase the maximum authorized punishment must be alleged in order to permit the possible increased punishment. No particular format is required.

##### Discussion

  How to draft specifications. For Article 134 offenses, also refer to paragraph 60c(6) in Part IV.

###### (A) Sample specifications.

Before drafting a specification, the drafter should read the pertinent

provisions of Part IV, where the elements of proof of various offenses and

forms for specifications appear.

[Note:  Be advised that the sample specifications in this Manual have not been amended to comport with _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010) and _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). Practitioners should read the notes above and draft specifications in conformity with the cases cited therein.]

###### (B) Numbering specifications.

If there is only one specification under a charge it is not numbered.

 When there is more than one specification under any charge, the specifications

 are numbered in Arabic numerals. The term "additional" is not

used in connection with the specifications under an additional charge.

###### (C) Name and description of the accused.

####### (i) Name.

The specification should state the accused's full name: first name,

middle name or initial, last name. If the accused is known by more than one

name, the name acknowledged by the accused should be used. If there is no

such acknowledgment, the name believed to be the true name should be listed

first, followed by all known aliases. For example: Seaman John P. Smith,

U.S. Navy, alias Lt. Robert R. Brown, U.S. Navy.

####### (ii) Military association.

The specification should state the accused's rank or grade. If the

rank or grade of the accused has changed since the date of an alleged offense,

and the change is pertinent to the offense charged, the accused should be

identified by the present rank or grade followed by rank or grade on the

date of the alleged offense. For example: In that

Seaman  , then Seaman Apprentice , etc.

####### (iii) Social security number or service number.

The social security number or service number of an accused should

not be stated in the specification.

####### (iv) Basis of personal jurisdiction.

######## (a) Military members on active duty.

Ordinarily, no allegation of the accused's armed force or unit or

organization is necessary for military members on active duty.

######## (b) Persons subject to the code under Article 2(a), subsections (3) through

 (12), or subject to trial by court-martial under Articles 3 or 4.

The specification should describe the accused's armed force, unit

or organization, position, or status which will indicate the basis of jurisdiction.

For example: John Jones, (a person employed by and serving with the U.S. Army

 in the field in time of war) (a person convicted of having obtained a fraudulent

discharge), etc.

###### (D) Date and time of offense

####### (i) In general.

The date of the commission of the offense charged should be stated

in the specification with sufficient precision to identify the offense and

enable the accused to understand what particular act or omission to defend

against.

####### (ii) Use of "on or about."

In alleging the date of the offense it is proper to allege it as

"on or about" a specified day.

####### (iii) Hour.

The exact hour of the offense is ordinarily not alleged except

in certain absence offenses. When the exact time is alleged, the 24-hour

clock should be used. The use of "at or about" is proper.

####### (iv) Extended periods.

When the acts specified extend(s) over a considerable period of

time it is proper to allege it (or them) as having occurred, for example,

"from about 15 June 1983 to about 4 November 1983," or "did

on divers occasions between 15 June 1983 and 4 November 1983."

###### (E) Place of offense.

The place of the commission of the offense charged should be stated

in the specification with sufficient precision to identify the offense and

enable the accused to understand the particular act or omission to defend

against. In alleging the place of the offense, it is proper to allege it

as "at or near" a certain place if the exact place is uncertain.

###### (F) Subject-matter jurisdiction allegations.

Pleading the accused's rank or grade along with the proper elements

of the offense normally will be sufficient to establish subject-matter jurisdiction.

###### (G) Description of offense.

####### (i) Elements.

The elements of the offense must be alleged, either expressly or by necessary implication, except that Article 134 specifications must expressly allege the terminal element. _See_ paragraph 60.c.(6) in Part IV. If a specific intent, knowledge, or state of mind is an element of the offense, it must be alleged.

####### (ii) Words indicating criminality.

If the alleged act is not itself an offense but is made an offense

either by applicable statute (including Articles 133 and 134), or regulation

or custom having the effect of law, then words indicating criminality such

as "wrongfully," "unlawfully," or "without

authority" (depending upon the nature of the offense) should be used

to describe the accused's acts.

####### (iii) Specificity.

The specification should be sufficiently specific to inform the

accused of the conduct charged, to enable the accused to prepare a defense,

and to protect the accused against double jeopardy. Only those facts that

make the accused's conduct criminal ordinarily should be alleged. Specific

 evidence supporting the allegations ordinarily should not be included in

the specifications.

###### (iv) Duplicitousness.

One specification should not allege more than one offense, either

conjunctively (the accused "lost and destroyed") or alternatively

(the accused "lost or destroyed"). However, if two acts or a

series of acts constitute one offense, they may be alleged conjunctively. _

See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(5).

###### (v) Lesser Included Offenses.

The elements of the contemplated lesser included offense should be compared with the elements of the greater offense to determine if the elements of the lesser offense are derivative of the greater offense and vice versa. _See_ discussion following paragraph 3.b.(1)(c) in Part IV and the related analysis in Appendix 23.

###### (H) Other considerations in drafting specifications.

####### (i) Principals.

All principals are charged as if each was the perpetrator. _

See_ paragraph 1 of Part IV for a discussion of principals.

####### (ii) Victim.

In the case of an offense against the person or property of a person,

the first name, middle initial and last name of such person should be alleged,

if known. If the name of the victim is unknown, a general physical description

may be used. If this cannot be done, the victim may be described as "a

person whose name is unknown." Military rank or grade should be alleged,

and must be alleged if an element of the offense, as in an allegation of

disobedience of the command of a superior officer. If the person has no military

position, it may otherwise be necessary to allege the status as in an allegation

of using provoking words toward a person subject to the code. _ See

_ paragraph 42 of Part IV.

####### (iii) Property.

In describing property generic terms should be used, such as "a

watch" or "a knife," and descriptive details such as make,

model, color, and serial number should ordinarily be omitted. In some instances,

however, details may be essential to the offense, so they must be alleged.

For example: the length of a knife blade may be important when alleging a

violation of general regulation prohibiting carrying a knife with a blade

that exceeds a certain length.

####### (iv) Value.

When the value of property or other amount determines the maximum

punishment which may be adjudged for an offense, the value or amount should

be alleged, for in such a case increased punishments that are contingent

upon value may not be adjudged unless there is an allegation, as well as

proof, of a value which will support the punishment. If several articles

of different kinds are the subject of the offense, the value of each article

should be stated followed by a statement of the aggregate value. Exact value

should be stated, if known. For ease of proof an allegation may be "of

a value not less than ." If only an approximate

value is known, it may be alleged as "of a value of about ." If the value of an item is unknown but obviously minimal,

the term "of some value" may be used. These principles apply to

allegations of amounts.

####### (v) Documents.

When documents other than regulations or orders must be alleged

(for example, bad checks in violation of Article 123a), the document may

be set forth verbatim (including photocopies and similar reproductions) or

may be described, in which case the description must be sufficient to inform

the accused of the offense charged.

####### (vi) Orders.

######## (a) General orders.

A specification alleging a violation of a general order or regulation

(Article 92(1)) must clearly identify the specific order or regulation allegedly

violated. The general order or regulation should be cited by its identifying

title or number, section or paragraph, and date. It is not necessary to recite

the text of the general order or regulation verbatim.

######## (b) Other orders.

If the order allegedly violated is an "other lawful order"

(Article 92(2)), it should be set forth verbatim or described in the specification.

When the order is oral, _see_ (vii) below.

######## (c) Negating exceptions.

If the order contains exceptions, it is not necessary that the specification

contain a specific allegation negating the exceptions. However, words of

criminality may be required if the alleged act is not necessarily criminal.

 _See_ subsection (G)(ii) of this discussion.

####### (vii) Oral statements.

When alleging oral statements the phrase "or words to that

effect" should be added.

####### (viii) Joint offense.

In the case of a joint offense each accused may be charged separately

as if each accused acted alone or all may be charged together in a single

specification. For example:

(a) If Doe and Roe are joint perpetrators of an offense and it is intended

to charge and try both at the same trial, they should be charged in a single

specification as follows:

       "In

that Doe and Roe, acting jointly and pursuant to a common intent, did.&puncsp;.&puncsp;.&puncsp;."

(b) If it is intended that Roe will be tried alone or that Roe will

be tried with Doe at a common trial, Roe may be charged in the same manner

as if Roe alone had committed the offense. However, to show in the specification

that Doe was a joint actor with Roe, even though Doe is not to be tried with

Roe, Roe may be charged as follows:

       "In

that Roe did, in conjunction with Doe, .&puncsp;.&puncsp;.&puncsp;."

####### (ix) Matters in aggravation.

Matters in aggravation that do not increase the maximum authorized

punishment ordinarily should not be alleged in the specification. Prior convictions

need not be alleged in the specification to permit increased punishment.

Aggravating factors in capital cases should not be alleged in the specification.

 Notice of such factors is normally provided in accordance with R.C.M. 1004(b)(1).

####### (x) Abbreviations.

Commonly used and understood abbreviations may be used, particularly

 abbreviations for ranks, grades, units and organizations, components, and

 geographic or political entities, such as the names of states or countries.

#### (4) Multiple offenses.

Charges and specifications alleging all known offenses by an accused may be preferred at the same time. Each specification shall state only one offense. What is substantially one transaction should not be made the basis for an unreasonable multiplication of charges against one person. Unreasonable multiplication of charges is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12); multiplicity is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B); and punishment limitations are addressed in R.C.M. 1003(c)(1)(C).

##### Discussion

The prohibition against unreasonable multiplication of charges addresses those features of military law that increase the potential for overreaching in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is based on reasonableness, and has no foundation in Constitutional rights. To determine if charges are unreasonably multiplied, see R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Because prosecutors are free to plead in the alternative, it may be reasonable to charge two or more offenses that arise from one transaction if sufficient doubt exists as to the facts or the law. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included offense thereof be separately charged. See also Part IV, paragraph 3, and R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.

  _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12) and 1003(c)(1)(C). For example, a person should

 not be charged with both failure to report for a routine scheduled duty,

such as reveille, and with absence without leave if the failure to report

occurred during the period for which the accused is charged with absence without

 leave. There are times, however, when sufficient doubt as to the facts or

the law exists to warrant making one transaction the basis for charging two

or more offenses. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included

 offense thereof be separately charged.

  _See also

_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.

#### (5) Multiple offenders.

A specification may name more than one person as an accused if each

person so named is believed by the accuser to be a principal in the offense

which is the subject of the specification.

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 601(e)(3) concerning joinder of

accused.

  A joint offense is one committed by two or more

persons acting together with a common intent. Principals may be charged jointly

with the commission of the same offense, but an accessory after the fact

cannot be charged jointly with the principal whom the accused is alleged to

have received, comforted, or assisted. Offenders are properly joined only

if there is a common unlawful design or purpose; the mere fact that several

persons happen to have committed the same kinds of offenses at the time, although

material as tending to show concert of purpose, does not necessarily establish

this. The fact that several persons happen to have absented themselves without

leave at about the same time will not, in the absence of evidence indicating

a joint design, purpose, or plan justify joining them in one specification,

for they may merely have been availing themselves of the same opportunity.

In joint offenses the participants may be separately or jointly charged.

However, if the participants are members of different armed forces, they must

be charged separately because their trials must be separately reviewed. The

preparation of joint charges is discussed in subsection (c)(3) Discussion

(H) (viii)_(a)_ of this rule. The advantage of a joint charge

 is that all accused will be tried at one trial, thereby saving time, labor,

and expense. This must be weighed against the possible unfairness to the

accused which may result if their defenses are inconsistent or antagonistic.

 An accused cannot be called as a witness except upon that accused's own request.

If the testimony of an accomplice is necessary, the accomplice should not

be tried jointly with those against whom the accomplice is expected to testify. _

See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 306.

  _See_ R.C.M.

603 concerning amending specifications.

  _See_ R.C.M.

906(b)(5) and (6) concerning motions to amend specifications and bills of

particulars.

### (d) Harmless error in citation.

Error in or omission of the designation of the article of the code

or other statute, law of war, or regulation violated shall not be ground

for dismissal of a charge or reversal of a conviction if the error or omission

did not prejudicially mislead the accused.

## Rule 308. Notification to accused of charges

### (a) Immediate commander.

The immediate commander of the accused shall cause the accused to

be informed of the charges preferred against the accused, and the name of

the person who preferred the charges and of any person who ordered the charges

to be preferred, if known, as soon as practicable.

#### Discussion

When notice is given, a certificate to that effect on the Charge

Sheet should be completed. _See_ Appendix 4.

### (b) Commanders at higher echelons.

When the accused has not been informed of the charges, commanders

at higher echelons to whom the preferred charges are forwarded shall cause

the accused to be informed of the matters required under subsection (a) of

this rule as soon as practicable.

### (c) Remedy.

The sole remedy for violation of this rule is a continuance or recess

of sufficient length to permit the accused to adequately prepare a defense,

and no relief shall be granted upon a failure to comply with this rule unless

the accused demonstrates that the accused has been hindered in the preparation

of a defense.

# CHAPTER IV. FORWARDING AND DISPOSITION OF CHARGES

## Rule 401. Forwarding and disposition of charges in general

### (a) Who may dispose of charges.

Only persons authorized to convene courts-martial or to administer

nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 may dispose of charges. A superior

competent authority may withhold the authority of a subordinate to dispose

 of charges in individual cases, types of cases, or generally.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 504 as to who may convene courts-martial

and paragraph 2 of Part V as to who may administer nonjudicial punishment.

If the power to convene courts-martial and to administer nonjudicial punishment

 has been withheld, a commander may not dispose of charges under this rule.

  Ordinarily

charges should be forwarded to the accused's immediate commander for initial

consideration as to disposition. Each commander has independent discretion

to determine how charges will be disposed of, except to the extent that the

commander's authority has been withheld by superior competent authority. _

See also_ R.C.M. 104.

  Each commander who forwards

or disposes of charges may make minor changes therein. _See_ R.C.M.

603(a) and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge should

be preferred anew. _See_ R.C.M. 603(d). If a commander is an

accuser (_see_ Article 1(9); 307(a)) that commander is ineligible

to refer such charges to a general or special court-martial. _See_ R.C.M.

 601(c). However, see R.C.M. 1302(b) (accuser may refer charges to a summary

court-martial).

### (b) Prompt determination.

When a commander with authority to dispose of charges receives charges,

that commander shall promptly determine what disposition will be made in

the interest of justice and discipline.

#### Discussion

In determining what level of disposition is appropriate, _

see_ R.C.M. 306(b) and (c). When charges are brought against two

or more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, _see_ R.C.M.

 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3). If it appears that the accused may lack mental capacity

to stand trial or may not have been mentally responsible at the times of

the offenses, _see_ R.C.M. 706; 909; 916(k).

  As

to the rules concerning speedy trial, _see_ R.C.M. 707. _

See also_ Articles 10; 30; 33; 98.

  Before determining

an appropriate disposition, a commander who receives charges should ensure

that: (1) a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M. 303 has been conducted; (2) the

accused has been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308; and (3) the charges

are in proper form.

### (c) How charges may be disposed of.

Unless the authority to do so has been limited or withheld by superior

competent authority, a commander may dispose of charges by dismissing any

or all of them, forwarding any or all of them to another commander for disposition,

or referring any or all of them to a court-martial which the commander is

empowered to convene. Charges should be disposed of in accordance with the

policy in R.C.M. 306(b).

#### Discussion

A commander may dispose of charges individually or collectively.

If charges are referred to a court-martial, ordinarily all known charges

should be referred to a single court-martial.

  _See

_ Appendix 3 when the charges may involve matters in which the Department

of Justice has an interest.

#### (1) Dismissal.

When a commander dismisses charges further disposition under R.C.M.

306(c) of the offenses is not barred.

##### Discussion

Charges are ordinarily dismissed by lining out and initialing the

deleted specifications or otherwise recording that a specification is dismissed.

When all charges and specifications are dismissed, the accuser and the accused

ordinarily should be informed.

  A charge should be dismissed

when it fails to state an offense, when it is unsupported by available evidence,

or when there are other sound reasons why trial by court-martial is not appropriate.

 Before dismissing charges because trial would be detrimental to the prosecution

of a war or harmful to national security, _see_ R.C.M. 401(d);

407(b).

  If the accused has already refused nonjudicial punishment,

charges should not be dismissed with a view to offering nonjudicial punishment

unless the accused has indicated willingness to accept nonjudicial punishment

if again offered. The decision whether to dismiss charges in such circumstances

is within the sole discretion of the commander concerned.

  Charges

may be amended in accordance with R.C.M. 603.

  It is appropriate

to dismiss a charge and prefer another charge anew when, for example, the

original charge failed to state an offense, or was so defective that a major

amendment was required (_see_ R.C.M. 603(d)), or did not adequately

reflect the nature or seriousness of the offense.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C) concerning the effect of dismissing charges

after the court-martial has begun.

#### (2) Forwarding charges.

##### (A) Forwarding to a superior commander.

When charges are forwarded to a superior commander for disposition,

the forwarding commander shall make a personal recommendation as to disposition.

If the forwarding commander is disqualified from acting as convening authority

in the case, the basis for the disqualification shall be noted.

###### Discussion

A commander's recommendation is within that commander's sole discretion.

No authority may direct a commander to make a specific recommendation as

to disposition.

  When charges are forwarded to a superior

commander with a view to trial by general or special court-martial, they

should be forwarded by a letter of transmittal or indorsement. To the extent

practicable without unduly delaying forwarding the charges, the letter should

include or carry as enclosures: a summary of the available evidence relating

to each offense; evidence of previous convictions and nonjudicial punishments

 of the accused; an indication that the accused has been offered and refused

nonjudicial punishment, if applicable; and any other matters required by

superior authority or deemed appropriate by the forwarding commander. Other

matters which may be appropriate include information concerning the accused's

background and character of military service, and a description of any unusual

circumstances in the case. The summary of evidence should include available

witness statements, documentary evidence, and exhibits. When practicable,

copies of signed statements of the witnesses should be forwarded, as should

copies of any investigative or laboratory reports. Forwarding charges should

not be delayed, however, solely to obtain such statements or reports when

it otherwise appears that sufficient evidence to warrant trial is or will

be available in time for trial. If because of the bulk of documents or exhibits,

it is impracticable to forward them with the letter of transmittal, they

should be properly preserved and should be referred to in the letter of transmittal.

  When

it appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings in

the case or that a deposition may be appropriate, that matter should be brought

to the attention of the convening authority promptly and should be noted

in the letter of transmittal.

  When charges are forwarded

with a view to disposition other than trial by general or special court-martial,

they should be accompanied by sufficient information to enable the authority

receiving them to dispose of them without further investigation.

##### (B) Other cases.

When charges are forwarded to a commander who is not a superior

of the forwarding commander, no recommendation as to disposition may be made.

###### Discussion

Except when directed to forward charges, a subordinate commander

may not be required to take any specific action to dispose of charges. _

See_ R.C.M. 104. _See also_ paragraph 1d(2) of Part

V. When appropriate, charges may be sent or returned to a subordinate commander

for compliance with procedural requirements. _See_, for example,

R.C.M. 303 (preliminary inquiry); R.C.M. 308 (notification to accused of charges).

#### (3) Referral of charges.

_See_ R.C.M. 403, 404, 407, 601.

### (d) National security matters.

If a commander who is not a general court-martial convening authority

finds that the charges warrant trial by court-martial but believes that trial

would probably be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to national

security, the charges shall be forwarded to the officer exercising general

court-martial convening authority.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 407(b).

## Rule 402. Action by commander not authorized to convene courts-martial

When in receipt of charges, a commander authorized to administer

nonjudicial punishment but not authorized to convene courts-martial may:

(1) Dismiss any charges; or

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,

the effect of dismissal, and options for further action.

(2) Forward them to a superior commander for disposition.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2) for additional guidance concerning

 forwarding charges. _See generally_ R.C.M. 303 (preliminary

inquiry); 308 (notification to accused of charges) concerning other duties

of the immediate commander when in receipt of charges.

  When

the immediate commander is authorized to convene courts-martial, _

see_ R.C.M. 403, 404, or 407, as appropriate.

## Rule 403. Action by commander exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction

### (a) Recording receipt.

Immediately upon receipt of sworn charges, an officer exercising

summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command shall cause the hour

and date of receipt to be entered on the charge sheet.

#### Discussion

_See_ Article 24 and R.C.M. 1302(a) concerning who

may exercise summary court-martial jurisdiction.

  The entry

indicating receipt is important because it stops the running of the statute

of limitations. _See_ Article 43; R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B). Charges

may be preferred and forwarded to an officer exercising summary court-martial

jurisdiction over the command to stop the running of the statute of limitations

even though the accused is absent without authority.

### (b) Disposition.

When in receipt of charges a commander exercising summary court-martial

jurisdiction may:

(1) Dismiss any charges;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,

the effect of dismissing charges, and options for further action.

(2) Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a

subordinate commander for disposition;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding charges

to a subordinate. When appropriate, charges may be forwarded to a subordinate

even if the subordinate previously considered them.

(3) Forward any charges to a superior commander for disposition;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(A) for guidance concerning

forwarding charges to a superior.

(4) Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a summary court-martial

for trial; or

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1302(c) concerning referral of charges

to a summary court-martial.

(5) Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct a

pretrial investigation under R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward the

report of investigation with the charges to a superior commander for disposition.

##### Discussion

An investigation should be directed when it appears that the charges

are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _

See_ R.C.M. 405. If an investigation of the subject matter already

has been conducted, _see_ R.C.M. 405(b).

## Rule 404. Action by commander exercising special court-martial jurisdiction

When in receipt of charges, a commander exercising special court-martial

jurisdiction may:

(a) Dismiss any charges;

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,

the effect of dismissing charges, and options for further action.

(b) Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a

 subordinate commander for disposition;

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding charges

to a subordinate. When appropriate, charges may be forwarded to a subordinate

even if that subordinate previously considered them.

(c) Forward any charges to a superior commander for disposition;

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(A) for guidance concerning

forwarding charges to a superior.

(d) Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a summary court-martial

or to a special court-martial for trial; or

#### Discussion

_See_ Article 23 and R.C.M. 504(b)(2) concerning

who may convene special courts-martial.

  _See_ R.C.M.

601 concerning referral of charges to a special court-martial. _See

_ R.C.M. 1302(c) concerning referral of charges to a summary court-martial.

(e) Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct a preliminary hearing under R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward the report of preliminary hearing with the charges to a superior commander for disposition.

#### Discussion

 A preliminary hearing should be directed when it appears that the charges are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _See_ R.C.M. 405. If a preliminary hearing of the subject matter already has been conducted, see R.C.M. 405(b) and 405(e)(2).

## Rule 404A. Disclosure of matters following direction of preliminary hearing

(a) When a convening authority directs a preliminary hearing under R.C.M. 405, counsel for

the government shall, subject to R.C.M. 404A(b)-(d) below, within 5 days of issuance of the Article 32 appointing order, provide to the defense the following information or matters:

(1) Charge sheet;

(2) Article 32 appointing order;

(3) Documents accompanying the charge sheet on which the preferral decision was based;

(4) Documents provided to the convening authority when deciding to direct the preliminary hearing;

(5) Documents the counsel for the government intends to present at the preliminary hearing; and

(6) Access to tangible objects counsel for the government intends to present at the preliminary hearing.

### (b) Contraband.

If items covered by subsection 404A(a) above are contraband, the disclosure required under this rule is a reasonable opportunity to inspect said contraband prior to the hearing.

### (c) Privilege.

If items covered by subsection 404A(a) above are privileged, classified or otherwise protected under Section V of Part III, no disclosure of those items is required under this rule. However, counsel for the government may disclose privileged, classified, or otherwise protected information covered by subsection 404A(a) above if authorized by the holder of the privilege, or in the case of Mil. R. Evid. 505 or 506, if authorized by a competent authority.

### (d) Protective order if privileged information is disclosed.

If the government agrees to disclose to the accused information to which the protections afforded by Section V of Part III may apply, the convening authority, or other person designated by regulation of the Secretary concerned, may enter an appropriate protective order, in writing, to guard against the compromise of information disclosed to the accused. The terms of any such protective order may include prohibiting the disclosure of the information except as authorized by the authority issuing the protective order, as well as those terms specified by Mil. R. Evid. 505(g)(2)-(6) or 506(g)(2)(5).

#### Discussion

 The purposes of this rule are to provide the accused with the documents used to make the determination to prefer charges and direct a preliminary hearing, and to allow the accused to prepare for the preliminary hearing. This rule is not intended to be a tool for discovery and does not impose the same discovery obligations found in R.C.M. 405 prior to amendments required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 or R.C.M. 701. Additional rules for disclosure of witnesses and other evidence in the preliminary hearing are provided in R.C.M. 405(g).

## Rule 405. Preliminary hearing

### (a) In general.

Except as provided in subsection (k) of this rule, no charge or specification may be referred to a general court-martial for trial until completion of a preliminary hearing in substantial compliance with this rule. A preliminary hearing conducted under this rule is not intended to serve as a means of discovery and will be limited to an examination of those issues necessary to determine whether there is probable cause to conclude that an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it; to determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; to consider the form of the charge(s); and to recommend the disposition that should be made of the charge(s). Failure to comply with this rule shall have no effect on the disposition of the charge(s) if the charge(s) is not referred to a general court-martial.

#### Discussion

 The function of the preliminary hearing is to ascertain and impartially weigh the facts needed for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing is not intended to perfect a case against the accused and is not intended to serve as a means of discovery or to provide a right of confrontation required at trial. Determinations and recommendations of the preliminary hearing officer are advisory.

 Failure to substantially comply with the requirements of Article 32, which failure prejudices the accused, may result in delay in disposition of the case or disapproval of the proceedings. See R.C.M. 905(b)(1) and 906(b)(3) concerning motions for appropriate relief relating to the preliminary hearing.

 The accused may waive the preliminary hearing. See subsection (k) of this rule. In such case, no preliminary hearing need be held. However, the convening authority authorized to direct the preliminary hearing may direct that it be conducted notwithstanding the waiver.

### (b) Earlier preliminary hearing.

If a preliminary hearing of the subject matter of an offense has been conducted before the accused is charged with an offense, and the accused was present at the preliminary hearing and afforded the rights to counsel, cross-examination, and presentation of evidence required by this rule, no further preliminary hearing is required.

### (c) Who may direct a preliminary hearing.

Unless prohibited by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a preliminary hearing may be directed under this rule by any court-martial convening authority. That authority may also give procedural instructions not inconsistent with these rules.

### (d) Personnel.

#### (1) Preliminary hearing officer.

Whenever practicable, the convening authority directing a preliminary hearing under this rule shall detail an impartial judge advocate certified under Article 27(b), not the accuser, as a preliminary hearing officer, who shall conduct the preliminary hearing and make a report that addresses whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense or offenses have been committed and that the accused committed the offense(s); whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; the form of the charges(s); and a recommendation as to the disposition of the charge(s).

 When the appointment of a judge advocate as the preliminary hearing officer is not practicable, or in exceptional circumstances in which the interest of justice warrants, the convening authority directing the preliminary hearing may detail an impartial commissioned officer, who is not the accuser, as the preliminary hearing officer. If the preliminary hearing officer is not a judge advocate, an impartial judge advocate certified under Article 27(b) shall be available to provide legal advice to the preliminary hearing officer.

 When practicable, the preliminary hearing officer shall be equal or senior in grade to the military counsel detailed to represent the accused and the government at the preliminary hearing. The Secretary concerned may prescribe additional limitations on the appointment of preliminary hearing officers.

 The preliminary hearing officer shall not depart from an impartial role and become an advocate for either side. The preliminary hearing officer is disqualified to act later in the same case in any other capacity.

##### Discussion

 The preliminary hearing officer, if not a judge advocate, should be an officer in the grade of O-4 or higher. The preliminary hearing officer may seek legal advice concerning the preliminary hearing officer's responsibilities from an impartial source, but may not obtain such advice from counsel for any party or counsel for a victim.

#### (2) Counsel to represent the United States.

A judge advocate, not the accuser, shall serve as counsel to represent the United States, and shall present evidence on behalf of the government relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing as set forth in subsection (a) of this rule.

#### (3) Defense counsel.

The commander who directed the investigation may also, as a matter

of discretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail:

##### (A) Detailed counsel.

Except as provided in subsection (d)(3)(B) of this rule, military counsel certified in accordance with Article 27(b) shall be detailed to represent the accused.

##### (B) Individual military counsel.

The accused may request to be represented by individual military counsel. Such requests shall be acted on in accordance with R.C.M. 506(b).

##### (C) Civilian counsel.

The accused may be represented by civilian counsel at no expense to the United States. Upon request, the accused is entitled to a reasonable time to obtain civilian counsel and to have such counsel present for the preliminary hearing. However, the preliminary hearing shall not be unduly delayed for this purpose. Representation by civilian counsel shall not limit the rights to military counsel under subsections (d)(3)(A) and (B) of this rule.

#### (4) Others.

The convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing may also, as a matter of discretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail:

(A) A reporter; and

(B) An interpreter.

### (e) Scope of preliminary hearing.

(1) The preliminary hearing officer shall limit the inquiry to the examination of evidence, including witnesses, necessary to:

(A) Determine whether there is probable cause to believe an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it;

(B) Determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused;

(C) Consider whether the form of the charge(s) is proper; and

(D) Make a recommendation as to the disposition of the charge(s).

(2) If evidence adduced during the preliminary hearing indicates that the accused committed any uncharged offense(s), the preliminary hearing officer may examine evidence and hear witnesses relating to the subject matter of such offense(s) and make the findings and recommendations enumerated in subsection (e)(1) of this rule regarding such offense(s) without the accused first having been charged with the offense. The accused's rights under subsection (f)(2) of this rule, and, where it would not cause undue delay to the proceedings, subsection (g) of this rule, are the same with regard to both charged and uncharged offenses. When considering uncharged offenses identified during the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing officer shall inform the accused of the general nature of each uncharged offense considered, and otherwise afford the accused the same opportunity for representation, cross examination, and presentation afforded during the preliminary hearing of any charged offense.

##### Discussion

 Except as set forth in subsection (h) below, the Mil. R. Evid. do not apply at a preliminary hearing. Except as prohibited elsewhere in this rule, a preliminary hearing officer may consider evidence, including hearsay, which would not be admissible at trial.

### (f) Rights of the accused.

(1) Prior to any preliminary hearing under this rule the accused shall have the right to:

(A) Notice of any witnesses that the government intends to call at the preliminary hearing and copies of or access to any written or recorded statements made by those witnesses that relate to the subject matter of any charged offense;

(i) For purposes of this rule, a "written statement" is one that is signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government; and

(ii) For purposes of this rule, a "recorded statement" is an oral statement made by the witness that is recorded contemporaneously with the making of the oral statement and contained in a digital or other recording or a transcription thereof that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government.

(B) Notice of, and reasonable access to, any other evidence that the government intends to offer at the preliminary hearing; and

(C) Notice of, and reasonable access to, evidence that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government that negates or reduces the degree of guilt of the accused for an offense charged.

(2) At any preliminary hearing under this rule the accused shall have the right to:

(A) Be advised of the charges under consideration;

(B) Be represented by counsel;

(C) Be informed of the purpose of the preliminary hearing;

(D) Be informed of the right against self-incrimination under Article 31;

(E) Except in the circumstances described in R.C.M. 804(c)(2), be present throughout the taking of evidence;

(F) Cross-examine witnesses on matters relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing;

(G) Present matters in defense and mitigation relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing; and

############ Discussion

 Unsworn statements by the accused, unlike those made under R.C.M. 1001(c)(2), shall be limited to matters in defense and mitigation.

(H) Make a statement relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

### (g) Production of Witnesses and Other Evidence.

#### (1) Military Witnesses.

(A) Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government the names of proposed military witnesses whom the accused requests that the government produce to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the requested form of the testimony, in accordance with the timeline established by the preliminary hearing officer. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and will seek to secure the witness's testimony for the hearing; or (2) the government objects to the proposed defense witness on the grounds that the testimony would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(B) If the government objects to the proposed defense witness, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(C) If the government does not object to the proposed defense military witness or the preliminary hearing officer determines that the military witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary, counsel for the government shall request that the commanding officer of the proposed military witness make that person available to provide testimony. The commanding officer shall determine whether the individual is available based on operational necessity or mission requirements, except that a victim, as defined in this rule, who declines to testify shall be deemed to be not available. If the commanding officer determines that the military witness is available, counsel for the government shall make arrangements for that individual's testimony. The commanding officer's determination of unavailability due to operational necessity or mission requirements is final. The military witness's commanding officer determines the availability of the witness and, if there is a dispute among the parties, determines whether the witness testifies in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony.

###### Discussion

 A commanding officer's determination of whether an individual is available, as well as the means by which the individual is available, is a balancing test. The more important the testimony of the witness, the greater the difficulty, expense, delay, or effect on military operations must be to deny production of the witness. Based on operational necessity and mission requirements, the witness's commanding officer may authorize the witness to testify by video teleconference, telephone, or similar means of remote testimony. Factors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; and the likelihood of significant interference with operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.

#### (2) Civilian Witnesses.

##### (A) Military witnesses.

Defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government the names of proposed civilian witnesses whom the accused requests that the government produce to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the requested form of the testimony, in accordance with the timeline established by the preliminary hearing officer. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and will seek to secure the witness's testimony for the hearing; or (2) the government objects to the proposed defense witness on the grounds that the testimony would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(B) If the government objects to the proposed defense witness, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

##### (C) Evidence generally.

If the government does not object to the proposed civilian witness or the preliminary hearing officer determines that the civilian witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary, counsel for the government shall invite the civilian witness to provide testimony and, if the individual agrees, shall make arrangements for that witness's testimony. If expense to the government is to be incurred, the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, or the convening authority's delegate, shall determine whether the witness testifies in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony.

###### Discussion

 Factors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-person testimony. Civilian witnesses may not be compelled to provide testimony at a preliminary hearing. Civilian witnesses may be paid for travel and associated expenses to testify at a preliminary hearing. _See_ Department of Defense Joint Travel Regulations.

##### (3) Other evidence.

###### (A) Evidence under the control of the government.

(i) Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government a list of evidence under the control of the government the accused requests the government produce to the defense for introduction at the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer may set a deadline by which defense requests must be received. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the evidence; or (2) the government objects to production of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(ii) If the government objects to production of the evidence, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the evidence should be produced.  The preliminary hearing officer shall determine whether the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the hearing. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that the evidence shall be produced, counsel for the government shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the evidence.

###### (B) Evidence not under the control of the government.

(i) Evidence not under the control of the government may be obtained through noncompulsory means or by _subpoenas duces tecum_ issued by counsel for the government in accordance with the process established by R.C.M. 703.

(ii) Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government a list of evidence not under the control of the government that the accused requests the government obtain. The preliminary hearing officer may set a deadline by which defense requests must be received. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ for the evidence; or (2) the government objects to production of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

(iii) If the government objects to production of the evidence, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the evidence should be produced.  If the preliminary hearing officer determines that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and that the issuance of _subpoenas duces tecum_ would not cause undue delay to the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing officer shall direct counsel for the government to issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ for the defense-requested evidence. Failure on the part of counsel for the government to issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ directed by the preliminary hearing officer shall be noted by the preliminary hearing officer in the report of preliminary hearing.

######## Discussion

 A _subpoena duces tecum_ to produce books, papers, documents, data, electronically stored information, or other objects for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 may be issued by counsel for the government. The preliminary hearing officer has no authority to issue a _subpoena duces tecum_. However, the preliminary hearing officer may direct counsel for the government to issue a _subpoena duces tecum_ for defense-requested evidence.

### (h) Military Rules of Evidence.

The Military Rules of Evidence do not apply in preliminary hearings under this rule except as follows:

(1) Mil. R. Evid. 301-303 and 305 shall apply in their entirety.

(2) Mil. R. Evid. 412 shall apply in any case that includes a charge defined as a sexual offense in Mil. R. Evid. 412(d), except that Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) shall not apply.

(3) Mil. R. Evid., Section V, Privileges, shall apply, except that Mil. R. Evid. 505(f)-(h) and (j); 506(f)-(h), (j), (k), and (m); and 514(d)(6) shall not apply.

(4) In applying these rules to a preliminary hearing, the term "military judge," as used in these rules, shall mean the preliminary hearing officer, who shall assume the military judge's authority to exclude evidence from the preliminary hearing, and who shall, in discharging this duty, follow the procedures set forth in the rules cited in subsections (h)(1)-(3) of this rule. However, the preliminary hearing officer is not authorized to order production of communications covered by Mil. R. Evid. 513 and 514.

##### Discussion

 The prohibition against ordering production of evidence does not preclude a preliminary hearing officer from considering evidence offered by the parties under Mil. R. Evid. 513 or 514.

(5) Failure to meet the procedural requirements of the applicable rules of evidence shall result in exclusion of that evidence from the preliminary hearing, unless good cause is shown.

##### Discussion

 Before considering evidence offered under subsection (h)(2), the preliminary hearing officer must determine that the evidence offered is relevant for the limited scope and purpose of the hearing, that the evidence is proper under subsection (h)(2), and that the probative value of such evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the alleged victim's privacy. The preliminary hearing officer shall set forth any limitations on the scope of such evidence.

 Evidence offered under subsection (h)(2) above must be protected pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552a. Although Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) allows admission of evidence of the victim's sexual behavior or predisposition at trial when it is constitutionally required, there is no constitutional requirement at an Article 32 hearing. There is likewise no constitutional requirement for a pretrial hearing officer to consider evidence under Mil. R. Evid. 514(d)(6) at an Article 32 hearing. Evidence deemed admissible by the preliminary hearing officer should be made a part of the report of preliminary hearing. _See_ subsection (j)(2)(C), _infra_. Evidence not considered, and the testimony taken during a closed hearing, should not be included in the report of preliminary hearing but should be appropriately safeguarded or sealed. The preliminary hearing officer and counsel representing the government are responsible for careful handling of any such evidence to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure.

### (i) Procedure.

#### (1) Generally.

 The preliminary hearing shall begin with the preliminary hearing officer informing the accused of the accused's rights under subsection (f) of this rule. Counsel for the government will then present evidence. Upon the conclusion of counsel for the government's presentation of evidence, defense counsel may present matters in defense and mitigation consistent with subsection (f) of this rule. For the purposes of this rule, "matters in mitigation" are defined as matters that may serve to explain the circumstances surrounding a charged offense. Both counsel for the government and defense shall be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The preliminary hearing officer may also question witnesses called by the parties. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that additional evidence is necessary to satisfy the requirements of subsection (e) above, the preliminary hearing officer may provide the parties an opportunity to present additional testimony or evidence relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer shall not consider evidence not presented at the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer shall not call witnesses _sua sponte_.

##### Discussion

 A preliminary hearing officer may only consider evidence within the limited purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall ensure that the scope of the hearing is limited to that purpose. When the preliminary hearing officer finds that evidence offered by either party is not within the scope of the hearing, he shall inform the parties and halt the presentation of that information.

#### (2) Notice to and presence of the victim(s).

(A) The victim(s) of an offense under the UCMJ has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of a preliminary hearing relating to the alleged offense and the reasonable right to confer with counsel for the government. For the purposes of this rule, a "victim" is a person who is alleged to have suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the matters set forth in a charge or specification under consideration and is named in one of the specifications under consideration.

(B) A victim of an offense under consideration at the preliminary hearing is not required to testify at the preliminary hearing.

(C) A victim has the right not to be excluded from any portion of a preliminary hearing related to the alleged offense, unless the preliminary hearing officer, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines the testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at the proceeding.

(D) A victim shall be excluded if a privilege set forth in Mil. R. Evid. 505 or 506 is invoked or if evidence is offered under Mil. R. Evid. 412, 513, or 514, for charges other than those in which the victim is named.

#### (3) Presentation of evidence.

##### (A) Testimony.

 Witness testimony may be provided in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony. All testimony shall be taken under oath, except that the accused may make an unsworn statement. The preliminary hearing officer shall only consider testimony that is relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

###### Discussion

 The following oath may be given to witnesses:

"Do you (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you God)?"

 The preliminary hearing officer is required to include in the report of the preliminary hearing, at a minimum, a summary of the substance of all testimony. See subsection (j)(2)(B) of this rule.

 All preliminary hearing officer notes of testimony and recordings of testimony should be preserved until the end of trial.

 If during the preliminary hearing any witness subject to the Code is suspected of an offense under the Code, the preliminary hearing officer should comply with the warning requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 305(c), (d), and, if necessary, (e).

 Bearing in mind that counsel are responsible for preparing and presenting their cases, the preliminary hearing officer may ask a witness questions relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the hearing. When questioning a witness, the preliminary hearing officer may not depart from an impartial role and become an advocate for either side.

##### (B) Other evidence.

 If relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing, and not cumulative, a preliminary hearing officer may consider other evidence, in addition to or in lieu of witness testimony, including statements, tangible evidence, or reproductions thereof, offered by either side, that the preliminary hearing officer determines is reliable. This other evidence need not be sworn.

#### (4) Access by spectators.

 Access by spectators to all or part of the proceedings may be restricted or foreclosed in the discretion of the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing or the preliminary hearing officer. Preliminary hearings are public proceedings and should remain open to the public whenever possible. When an overriding interest exists that outweighs the value of an open preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing may be closed to spectators. Any closure must be narrowly tailored to achieve the overriding interest that justified the closure. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conclude that no lesser methods short of closing the preliminary hearing can be used to protect the overriding interest in the case. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conduct a case-by-case, witness-by-witness, circumstance-by-circumstance analysis of whether closure is necessary. If a convening authority or preliminary hearing officer believes closing the preliminary hearing is necessary, the convening authority or preliminary hearing officer must make specific findings of fact in writing that support the closure. The written findings of fact must be included in the report of preliminary hearing. Examples of overriding interests may include: preventing psychological harm or trauma to a child witness or an alleged victim of a sexual crime, protecting the safety or privacy of a witness or alleged victim, protecting classified material, and receiving evidence where a witness is incapable of testifying in an open setting.

##### (5) Presence of accused.

 The further progress of the taking of evidence shall not be prevented and the accused shall be considered to have waived the right to be present whenever the accused:

(A) After being notified of the time and place of the proceeding is voluntarily absent; or

(B) After being warned by the preliminary hearing officer that disruptive conduct will cause removal from the proceeding, persists in conduct which is such as to justify exclusion from the proceeding.

##### (6) Recording of the preliminary hearing.

 Counsel for the government shall ensure that the preliminary hearing is recorded by a suitable recording device. A victim, as defined by subsection (i)(2)(A) of this rule, may request access to, or a copy of, the recording of the proceedings. Upon request, counsel for the government shall provide the requested access to, or a copy of, the recording to the victim not later than a reasonable time following dismissal of the charges, unless charges are dismissed for the purpose of re-referral, or court-martial adjournment. A victim is not entitled to classified information or access to or a copy of a recording of closed sessions which the victim did not have the right to attend under subsections (i)(2)(C) or (i)(2)(D) of this rule.

###### Discussion

Counsel for the government shall provide victims with access to, or a copy of, the recording of the proceedings in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe.

##### (7) Objections.

 Any objection alleging failure to comply with this rule shall be made to the convening authority via the preliminary hearing officer.

##### (8) Sealed exhibits and proceedings.

 The preliminary hearing officer has the authority to order exhibits, proceedings, or other matters sealed as described in R.C.M. 1103A.

### (j) Report of preliminary hearing.

#### (1) In general.

The preliminary hearing officer shall make a timely written report of the preliminary hearing to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing.

##### Discussion

 If practicable, the charges and the report of preliminary hearing should be forwarded to the general court-martial convening authority within 8 days after an accused is ordered into arrest or confinement. _See_ Article 33, UCMJ.

#### (2) Contents.

The report of preliminary hearing shall include:

(A) A statement of names and organizations or addresses of defense counsel and whether defense counsel was present throughout the taking of evidence, or if not present the reason why;

(B) The substance of the testimony taken on both sides;

(C) Any other statements, documents, or matters considered by the preliminary hearing officer, or recitals of the substance or nature of such evidence;

(D) A statement that an essential witness may not be available for trial;

(E) An explanation of any delays in the preliminary hearing;

(F) A notation if counsel for the government failed to issue a subpoena duces tecum that was directed by the preliminary hearing officer;

(G) The preliminary hearing officer's determination as to whether there is probable cause to believe the offense(s) listed on the charge sheet or otherwise considered at the preliminary hearing occurred;

(H) The preliminary hearing officer's determination as to whether there is probable cause to believe the accused committed the offense(s) listed on the charge sheet or otherwise considered at the preliminary hearing;

(I) The preliminary hearing officer's determination as to whether a court-martial has jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused;

(J) The preliminary hearing officer's determination as to whether the charge(s) and specification(s) are in proper form; and

(K) The recommendations of the preliminary hearing officer regarding disposition of the charge(s).

###### Discussion

 The preliminary hearing officer may include any additional matters useful to the convening authority in determining disposition. The preliminary hearing officer may recommend that the charges and specifications be amended or that additional charges be preferred. _See_ R.C.M. 306 and 401 concerning other possible dispositions.

#### (3) Sealed exhibits and proceedings.

. If the report of preliminary hearing contains exhibits, proceedings, or other matters ordered sealed by the preliminary hearing officer in accordance with R.C.M. 1103A, counsel for the government shall cause such materials to be sealed so as to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure.

#### (4) Distribution of the report.

The preliminary hearing officer shall cause the report to be delivered to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing. That convening authority shall promptly cause a copy of the report to be delivered to each accused.

#### (5) Objections.

Any objection to the report shall be made to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, via the preliminary hearing officer, within 5 days of its receipt by the accused. This subsection does not prohibit a convening authority from referring the charge(s) or taking other action within the 5-day period.

### (k) Waiver.

The accused may waive a preliminary hearing under this rule. In addition, failure to make a timely objection under this rule, including an objection to the report, shall constitute waiver of the objection. Relief from the waiver may be granted by the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, a superior convening authority, or the military judge, as appropriate, for good cause shown.

#### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3).

 The convening authority who receives an objection may direct that the preliminary hearing be reopened or take other action, as appropriate.

## Rule 406. Pretrial advice

### (a) In general.

Before any charge may be referred for trial by a general court-martial,

it shall be referred to the staff judge advocate of the convening authority

for consideration and advice.

#### Discussion

A pretrial advice need not be prepared in cases referred to special

or summary courts-martial. A convening authority may, however, seek the advice

of a lawyer before referring charges to such a court-martial. When charges

have been withdrawn from a general court-martial (_see_ R.C.M.

604) or when a mistrial has been declared in a general court-martial (_

see_ R.C.M. 915), supplementary advice is necessary before the charges

may be referred to another general court-martial.

  The staff

judge advocate may make changes in the charges and specifications in accordance

 with R.C.M. 603.

### (b) Contents.

The advice of the staff judge advocate shall include a written and

signed statement which sets forth that person's:

(1) Conclusion with respect to whether each specification alleges an

 offense under the code;

(2) Conclusion with respect to whether the allegation of each offense

is warranted by the evidence indicated in the report of preliminary hearing (if

there is such a report);

(3) Conclusion with respect to whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction

over the accused and the offense; and

(4) Recommendation of the action to be taken by the convening authority.

##### Discussion

The staff judge advocate is personally responsible for the pretrial

advice and must make an independent and informed appraisal of the charges

and evidence in order to render the advice. Another person may prepare the

advice, but the staff judge advocate is, unless disqualified, responsible

for it and must sign it personally. Grounds for disqualification in a case

include previous action in that case as preliminary hearing officer, military judge,

trial counsel, defense counsel, or member.

  The advice need not set forth the underlying analysis or rationale for its conclusions. Ordinarily, the charge sheet, forwarding letter, endorsements, and report of investigation

are forwarded with the pretrial advice. In addition, the pretrial advice

should include when appropriate: a brief summary of the evidence; discussion

of significant aggravating, extenuating, or mitigating factors; any recommendations

for disposition of the case by commanders or others who have forwarded the

charges; and the recommendation of the Article 32 preliminary hearing officer.

However, there is no legal requirement to include such information, and failure

to do so is not error.

  Whatever matters are included in

the advice, whether or not they are required, should be accurate. Information

which is incorrect or so incomplete as to be misleading may result in a determination

that the advice is defective, necessitating appropriate relief. _

See_ R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3).

  The standard of proof to be applied in R.C.M. 406(b)(2) is probable cause. _See_ R.C.M. 601(d)(1). Defects in the pretrial advice are not jurisdictional and are raised

by pretrial motion. _See_ R.C.M.905(b)(1) and its Discussion.

### (c) Distribution.

A copy of the advice of the staff judge advocate shall be provided

to the defense if charges are referred to trial by general court-martial.

## Rule 407. Action by commander exercising general court-martial jurisdiction

### (a) Disposition.

When in receipt of charges, a commander exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction may:

(1) Dismiss any charges;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges

and the effect of dismissing charges.

(2) Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a

subordinate commander for disposition;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding charges

to a subordinate.

  A subordinate commander may not be required

to take any specific action or to dispose of charges. _See_ R.C.M.

104. _See also_ paragraph 1d(2) of Part V. When appropriate,

charges may be sent or returned to a subordinate commander for compliance

with procedural requirements. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 303

(preliminary inquiry); R.C.M. 308 (notification to accused of charges).

(3) Forward any charges to a superior commander for disposition;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 401 (c)(2)(A) for guidance concerning

forwarding charges to a superior.

(4) Refer charges to a summary court-martial or a special court-martial

 for trial;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 601; 1302(c).

(5) Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct a

pretrial investigation under R.C.M. 405, after which additional action under

this rule may be taken;

##### Discussion

An investigation should be directed when it appears the charges

are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _

See_ R.C.M. 405. If an investigation of the subject matter already

has been conducted. _See_ R.C.M. 405(b).

(6) Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a general court-martial.

##### Discussion

_See_ Article 22 and R.C.M. 504(b)(1) concerning who

may exercise general court-martial jurisdiction.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 601 concerning referral of charges. _See_ R.C.M.

306 and 401 concerning other dispositions.

### (b) National security matters.

When in receipt of charges the trial of which the commander exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction finds would probably be inimical to the

prosecution of a war or harmful to national security, that commander, unless

otherwise prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned, shall determine

whether trial is warranted and, if so, whether the security considerations

involved are paramount to trial. As the commander finds appropriate, the

commander may dismiss the charges, authorize trial of them, or forward them

to a superior authority.

#### Discussion

In time of war, charges may be forwarded to the Secretary concerned

 for disposition under Article 43(e). Under Article 43(e), the Secretary may

 take action suspending the statute of limitations in time of war.

or restrict the use of reporters in special courts-martial.

## Rule 502. Qualifications and duties of personnel of courts-martial

### (a) Members.

#### (1) Qualifications.

The members detailed to a court-martial shall be those persons who

and deciding all matters submitted to them, except as otherwise specifically

provided in these rules. No member may use rank or position to influence

another member. No member of a court-martial may have access to or use in

any open or closed session this Manual, reports of decided cases, or any

other reference material, except the president of a special court-martial

without a military judge may use such materials in open session.

##### Discussion

Members should avoid any conduct or communication with the military

judge, witnesses, or other trial personnel during the trial which might present

an appearance of partiality. Except as provided in these rules, members should

not discuss any part of a case with anyone until the matter is submitted to

them for determination. Members should not on their own visit or conduct

a view of the scene of the crime and should not investigate or gather evidence

of the offense. Members should not form an opinion on any matter in connection

with a case until that matter has been submitted to them for determination.

court-martial shall be designated for such duties by the Judge Advocate General

or the Judge Advocate General's designee, certified to be qualified for duty

as a military judge of a general court-martial, and assigned and directly

responsible to the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate General's

designee. The Secretary concerned may prescribe additional qualifications

for military judges in special courts-martial. As used in this subsection

 "military judge" does not include the president of a special

court-martial without a military judge.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 801 for description of some of the general

duties of the military judge.

  Military judges assigned

as general court-martial judges may perform duties in addition to the primary

duty of judge of a general court-martial only when such duties are assigned

or approved by the Judge Advocate General, or a designee, of the service

which a military judge in special courts-martial may perform may be prescribed

in regulations of the Secretary concerned.

### (d) Counsel.

#### (1) Certified counsel required.

Only persons certified under Article 27(b) as competent to perform

duties as counsel in courts-martial by the Judge Advocate General of the

armed force of which the counsel is a member may be detailed as defense counsel

or associate defense counsel in general or special courts-martial or as trial

counsel in general courts-martial.

##### Discussion

To be certified by the Judge Advocate General concerned under Article

27(b), a person must be a member of the bar of a Federal court or the highest

court of a State. The Judge Advocate General concerned may establish additional

 requirements for certification.

  When the accused has individual

military or civilian defense counsel, the detailed counsel is "associate

counsel" unless excused from the case. _See_ R.C.M. 506(b)(3).

#### (2) Other military counsel.

Any commissioned officer may be detailed as trial counsel in special

courts-martial, or as assistant trial counsel or assistant defense counsel

additional qualifications for such counsel.

#### (3) Qualifications of individual military and civilian defense counsel.

Individual military or civilian defense counsel who represents an

accused in a court-martial shall be:

(A) A member of the bar of a Federal court or of the bar of the highest

court of a State; or

(B) If not a member of such a bar, a lawyer who is authorized by a recognized

licensing authority to practice law and is found by the military judge to

be qualified to represent the accused upon a showing to the satisfaction

of the military judge that the counsel has appropriate training and familiarity

with the general principles of criminal law which apply in a court-martial.

###### Discussion

In making such a determination-particularly in the case of

civilian defense counsel who are members only of a foreign bar-the

(i) the availability of the counsel at times at which sessions of the

court-martial have been scheduled;

(ii) whether the accused wants the counsel to appear with military defense

counsel;

(iii) the familiarity of the counsel with spoken English;

(iv) practical alternatives for discipline of the counsel in the event

 defense counsel.

#### (4) Disqualifications.

or, except when expressly requested by the accused, as defense counsel or

associate or assistant defense counsel in any case in which that person is

or has been:

(A) The accuser;

(B) An investigating officer;

(C) A military judge; or

(D) A member.

No person who has acted as counsel for a party may

serve as counsel for an opposing party in the same case.

###### Discussion

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is presumed that

a person who, between referral and trial of a case, has been detailed as

counsel for any party to the court-martial to which the case has been referred,

 has acted in that capacity.

#### (5) Duties of trial and assistant trial counsel.

The trial counsel shall prosecute cases on behalf of the United

States and shall cause the record of trial of such cases to be prepared.

Under the supervision of trial counsel an assistant trial counsel may perform

any act or duty which trial counsel may perform under law, regulation, or

custom of the service.

##### Discussion

###### (A) General duties before trial.

Immediately upon receipt of referred charges, trial counsel should

cause a copy of the charges to be served upon accused. _See_ R.C.M.

602.

  Trial counsel should: examine the charge sheet and allied

papers for completeness and correctness; correct (and initial) minor errors

or obvious mistakes in the charges but may not without authority make any

substantial changes (_see_ R.C.M. 603); and assure that the

information about the accused on the charge sheet and any evidence of previous

convictions are accurate.

###### (B) Relationship with convening authority.

Trial counsel should: report to the convening authority any substantial

irregularity in the convening orders, charges, or allied papers; report an

actual or anticipated reduction of the number of members below quorum to

the convening authority; bring to the attention of the convening authority

any case in which trial counsel finds trial inadvisable for lack of evidence

or other reasons.

###### (C) Relations with the accused and defense counsel.

Trial counsel must communicate with a represented accused only

through the accused's defense counsel. However, _see_ R.C.M.

 602. Trial counsel may not attempt to induce an accused to plead guilty or

 surrender other important rights.

###### (D) Preparation for trial.

Trial counsel should: ensure that a suitable room, a reporter (if

authorized), and necessary equipment and supplies are provided for the court-martial;

obtain copies of the charges and specifications and convening orders for

each member and all personnel of the court-martial; give timely notice to

the members, other parties, other personnel of the court-martial, and witnesses

for the prosecution and (if known) defense of the date, time, place, and

uniform of the meetings of the court-martial; ensure that any person having

custody of the accused is also informed; comply with applicable discovery

rules (_see_ R.C.M. 701); prepare to make a prompt, full,

and orderly presentation of the evidence at trial; consider the elements

of proof of each offense charged, the burden of proof of guilt and the burdens

of proof on motions which may be anticipated, and the Military Rules of Evidence;

secure for use at trial such legal texts as may be available and necessary

to sustain the prosecution's contentions; arrange for the presence of witnesses

and evidence in accordance with R.C.M. 703; prepare to make an opening statement

of the prosecution's case (_see_ R.C.M. 913); prepare to conduct

the examination and cross-examination of witnesses; and prepare to make final

argument on the findings and, if necessary, on sentencing (_see_ R.C.M.

919; 1001(g)).

###### (E) Trial.

Trial counsel should bring to the attention of the military judge

any substantial irregularity in the proceedings. Trial counsel should not

allude to or disclose to the members any evidence not yet admitted or reasonably

expected to be admitted in evidence or intimate, transmit, or purport to

transmit to the military judge or members the views of the convening authority

or others as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, an appropriate sentence,

or any other matter within the discretion of the court-martial.

###### (F) Post-trial duties.

Trial counsel must promptly provide written notice of the findings

and sentence adjudged to the convening authority or a designee, the accused's

immediate commander, and (if applicable) the officer in charge of the confinement

 facility (_see_ R.C.M. 1101(a)), and supervise the preparation,

authentication, and distribution of copies of the record as required by these

rules and regulations of the Secretary concerned (_see_ R.C.M.

1103; 1104).

###### (G) Assistant trial counsel.

An assistant trial counsel may act in that capacity only under the

supervision of the detailed trial counsel. Responsibility for trial of a

case may not devolve to an assistant not qualified to serve as trial counsel.

Unless the contrary appears, all acts of an assistant trial counsel are presumed

to have been done by the direction of the trial counsel. An assistant trial

counsel may not act in the absence of trial counsel at trial in a general

 court-martial unless the assistant has the qualifications required of a trial

counsel. _See_ R.C.M. 805(c).

#### (6) Duties of defense and associate or assistant defense counsel.

Defense counsel shall represent the accused in matters under the

code and these rules arising from the offenses of which the accused is then

suspected or charged. Under the supervision of the defense counsel an associate

or assistant defense counsel may perform any act or duty which a defense counsel

may perform under law, regulation, or custom of the service.

##### Discussion

###### (A) Initial advice by military defense counsel.

Defense counsel should promptly explain to the accused the general

 duties of the defense counsel and inform the accused of the rights to request

 individual military counsel of the accused's own selection, and of the effect

 of such a request, and to retain civilian counsel. If the accused wants to

 request individual military counsel, the defense counsel should immediately

inform the convening authority through trial counsel and, if the request

is approved, serve as associate counsel if the accused requests and the convening

authority permits. Unless the accused directs otherwise, military counsel

will begin preparation of the defense immediately after being detailed without

waiting for approval of a request for individual military counsel or retention

of civilian counsel. _See R.C.M. 506._

###### (B) General duties of defense counsel.

Defense counsel must: guard the interests of the accused zealously

 within the bounds of the law without regard to personal opinion as to the

guilt of the accused; disclose to the accused any interest defense counsel

may have in connection with the case, any disqualification, and any other

matter which might influence the accused in the selection of counsel; represent

the accused with undivided fidelity and may not disclose the accused's secrets

or confidences except as the accused may authorize (_see also_ Mil.

 R. Evid. 502). A defense counsel designated to represent two or more co-accused

 in a joint or common trial or in allied cases must be particularly alert

to conflicting interests of those accused. Defense counsel should bring such

 matters to the attention of the military judge so that the accused's understanding

and choice may be made a matter of record. _See_ R.C.M. 901(d)(4)(D).

  Defense counsel must explain to the accused: the elections

available as to composition of the court-martial and assist the accused to

make any request necessary to effect the election (_see_ R.C.M.

903); the right to plead guilty or not guilty and the meaning and effect

of a plea of guilty; the rights to introduce evidence, to testify or remain

silent, and to assert any available defense; and the rights to present evidence

during sentencing and the rights of the accused to testify under oath, make

an unsworn statement, and have counsel make a statement on behalf of the accused.

These explanations must be made regardless of the intentions of the accused

as to testifying and pleading.

  Defense counsel should try

to obtain complete knowledge of the facts of the case before advising the

accused, and should give the accused a candid opinion of the merits of the

case.

###### (C) Preparation for trial.

Defense counsel may have the assistance of trial counsel in obtaining

the presence of witnesses and evidence for the defense. _See_ R.C.M.

703.

  Defense counsel should consider the elements of proof

of the offenses alleged and the pertinent rules of evidence to ensure that

evidence that the defense plans to introduce is admissible and to be prepared

to object to inadmissible evidence offered by the prosecution.

  Defense

counsel should: prepare to make an opening statement of the defense case

(_see_ R.C.M. 913(b)); and prepare to examine and cross-examine witnesses,

and to make final argument on the findings and, if necessary, on sentencing

(_see_ R.C.M. 919; 1001(g)).

###### (D) Trial.

Defense counsel should represent and protect the interests of the

accused at trial.

  When a trial proceeds in the absence of the accused,

defense counsel must continue to represent the accused.

###### (E) Post-trial duties.

####### (i) Deferment of confinement.

If the accused is sentenced to confinement, the defense counsel

must explain to the accused the right to request the convening authority

to defer service of the sentence to confinement and assist the accused in

making such a request if the accused chooses to make one. _See_ R.C.M.

1101(c).

####### (ii) Examination of the record; appellate brief.

The defense counsel should in any case examine the record for accuracy

and note any errors in it. This notice may be forwarded for attachment to

the record. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(C). _See_

also R.C.M. 1103(i)(1)(B).

####### (iii) Submission of matters.

If the accused is convicted, the defense counsel may submit to the

convening authority matters for the latter's consideration in deciding whether

to approve the sentence or to disapprove any findings. _See_

R.C.M. 1105. Defense counsel should discuss with the accused the right to

submit matters to the convening authority and the powers of the convening

authority in taking action on the case. Defense counsel may also submit a

 brief of any matters counsel believes should be considered on further review.

####### (iv) Appellate rights.

Defense counsel must explain to the accused the rights to appellate

review that apply in the case, and advise the accused concerning the exercise

of those rights. If the case is subject to review by the Court of Criminal

Appeals, defense counsel should explain the powers of that court and advise

the accused of the right to be represented by counsel before it. _

See_ R.C.M. 1202 and 1203. Defense counsel should also explain the

possibility of further review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

and the Supreme Court. _See_ R.C.M. 1204 and 1205. If the

case may be examined in the office of the Judge Advocate General under Article

69(a), defense counsel should explain the nature of such review to the accused. _

See_ R.C.M. 1201(b)(1). Defense counsel must explain the consequences

of waiver of appellate review, when applicable, and, if the accused elects

to waive appellate review, defense counsel will assist in preparing the waiver. _

See_ R.C.M. 1110. If the accused waives appellate review, or if it

is not available, defense counsel should explain that the case will be reviewed

by a judge advocate and should submit any appropriate matters for consideration

by the judge advocate. _ See_ R.C.M. 1112. The accused should

be advised of the right to apply to the Judge Advocate General for relief

under Article 69(b) when such review is available. _See_ R.C.M.

1201(b)(3).

####### (v) Examination of post-trial recommendation.

When the post-trial recommendation is served on defense counsel,

defense counsel should examine it and reply promptly in writing, noting any

errors or omissions. Failure to note defects in the recommendation waives

them. _See_ R.C.M. 1106(f).

###### (F) Associate or assistant defense counsel.

Associate or assistant counsel may act in that capacity only under

the supervision and by the general direction of the defense counsel. A detailed

defense counsel becomes associate defense counsel when the accused has individual

military or civilian counsel and detailed counsel is not excused. Although

associate counsel acts under the general supervision of the defense counsel,

associate defense counsel may act without such supervision when circumstances

require. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 805(c). An assistant defense

counsel may do this only if such counsel has the qualifications to act as

defense counsel. Responsibility for trial of a case may not devolve upon

an assistant who is not qualified to serve as defense counsel. An assistant

defense counsel may not act in the absence of the defense counsel at trial

unless the assistant has the qualifications required of a defense counsel. _

See also_ R.C.M. 805. Unless the contrary appears, all acts of an

assistant or associate defense counsel are presumed to have been done under

the supervision of the defense counsel.

### (e) Interpreters, reporters, escorts, bailiffs, clerks, and guards.

#### (1) Qualifications.

The qualifications of interpreters and reporters may be prescribed

by the Secretary concerned. Any person who is not disqualified under subsection

(e)(2) of this rule may serve as escort, bailiff, clerk, or orderly, subject

to removal by the military judge.

#### (2) Disqualifications.

In addition to any disqualifications which may be prescribed by

the Secretary concerned, no person shall act as interpreter, reporter, escort,

bailiff, clerk, or orderly in any case in which that person is or has been

in the same case:

(A) The accuser;

(B) A witness;

(C) An investigating officer;

(D) Counsel for any party; or

(E) A member of the court-martial or of any earlier court-martial of

which the trial is a rehearing or new or other trial.

#### (3) Duties.

In addition to such other duties as the Secretary concerned may

prescribe, the following persons may perform the following duties.

##### (A) Interpreters.

Interpreters shall interpret for the court-martial or for an accused

who does not speak or understand English.

###### Discussion

The accused also may retain an unofficial interpreter without expense

to the United States.

##### (B) Reporters.

Reporters shall record the proceedings and testimony and shall transcribe

them so as to comply with the requirements for the record of trial as prescribed

in these rules.

##### (C) Others.

Other personnel detailed for the assistance of the court-martial

shall have such duties as may be imposed by the military judge.

#### (4) Payment of reporters, interpreters.

The Secretary concerned may prescribe regulations for the payment

of allowances, expenses, per diem, and compensation of reporters and interpreters.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 807 regarding oaths for reporters, interpreters,

and escorts.

### (f) Action upon discovery of disqualification or lack of qualifications.

Any person who discovers that a person detailed to a court-martial

is disqualified or lacks the qualifications specified by this rule shall

cause a report of the matter to be made before the court-martial is first

 in session to the convening authority or, if discovered later, to the military

judge.

## Rule 503. Detailing members, military judge, and counsel

### (a) Members.

#### (1) In general.

 The convening authority shall detail qualified persons as members

for courts-martial.

##### Discussion

The following persons are subject to challenge under R.C.M. 912(f)

and should not be detailed as members: any person who is, in the same case,

an accuser, witness, preliminary hearing officer, or counsel for any party; any

person who, in the case of a new trial, other trial, or rehearing, was a

member of any court-martial which previously heard the case; any person who

is junior to the accused, unless this is unavoidable; an enlisted member from

the same unit as the accused; or any person who is in arrest or confinement.

#### (2) Enlisted members.

An enlisted accused may, before assembly, request orally on the

record or in writing that enlisted persons serve as members of the general

or special court-martial to which that accused's case has been or will be

referred. If such a request is made, an enlisted accused may not be tried

by a court-martial the membership of which does not include enlisted members

in a number comprising at least one-third of the total number of members

unless eligible enlisted members cannot be obtained because of physical conditions

or military exigencies. If the appropriate number of enlisted members cannot

be obtained, the court-martial may be assembled, and the trial may proceed

without them, but the convening authority shall make a detailed written explanation

why enlisted members could not be obtained which must be appended to the record

of trial.

##### Discussion

When such a request is made, the convening authority should:

(1) Detail an appropriate number of enlisted members to the court-martial

and, if appropriate, relieve an appropriate number of commissioned or warrant

officers previously detailed;

(2) Withdraw the charges from the court-martial to which they were originally

 referred and refer them to a court-martial which includes the proper proportion

of enlisted members; or

(3) Advise the court-martial before which the charges are then pending

to proceed in the absence of enlisted members if eligible enlisted members

cannot be detailed because of physical conditions or military exigencies.

    _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(D)(iii).

#### (3) Members from another command or armed force.

A convening authority may detail as members of general and special

courts-martial persons under that convening authority's command or made available

by their commander, even if those persons are members of an armed force different

from that of the convening authority or accused.

##### Discussion

Concurrence of the proper commander may be oral and need not be

shown by the record of trial.

  Members should ordinarily

be of the same armed force as the accused. When a court-martial composed

of members of different armed forces is selected, at least a majority of the

members should be of the same armed force as the accused unless exigent circumstances

make it impractical to do so without manifest injury to the service.

### (b) Military judge.

#### (1) By whom detailed.

The military judge shall be detailed, in accordance with regulations

of the Secretary concerned, by a person assigned as a military judge and

directly responsible to the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate

General's designee. The authority to detail military judges may be delegated

to persons assigned as military judges. If authority to detail military judges

has been delegated to a military judge, that military judge may detail himself

or herself as military judge for a court-martial.

#### (2) Record of detail.

The order detailing a military judge shall be reduced to writing

and included in the record of trial or announced orally on the record at

the court-martial. The writing or announcement shall indicate by whom the

military judge was detailed. The Secretary concerned may require that the

order be reduced to writing.

#### (3) Military judge from a different armed force.

A military judge from one armed force may be detailed to a court-martial

convened in a different armed force, a combatant command or joint command when permitted by the Judge Advocate

General of the armed force of which the military judge is a member. The Judge

Advocate General may delegate authority to make military judges available

for this purpose.

### (c) Counsel.

#### (1) By whom detailed.

Trial and defense counsel, assistant trial and defense counsel,

and associate defense counsel shall be detailed in accordance with regulations

of the Secretary concerned. If authority to detail counsel has been delegated

to a person, that person may detail himself or herself as counsel for a court-martial.

#### (2) Record of detail.

The order detailing a counsel shall be reduced to writing and included

in the record of trial or announced orally on the record at the court-martial.

The writing or announcement shall indicate by whom the counsel was detailed.

The Secretary concerned may require that the order be reduced to writing.

#### (3) Counsel from a different armed force.

A person from one armed force may be detailed to serve as counsel

in a court-martial in a different armed force, a combatant command or joint command when permitted by the Judge Advocate General of the armed force of which the counsel is a member. The

Judge Advocate General may delegate authority to make persons available for

this purpose.

## Rule 504. Convening courts-martial

### (a) In general.

A court-martial is created by a convening order of the convening

authority.

### (b) Who may convene courts-martial.

#### (1) General courts-martial.

Unless otherwise limited by superior competent authority, general

courts-martial may be convened by persons occupying positions designated

in Article 22(a) and by any commander designated by the Secretary concerned

 or empowered by the President.

##### Discussion

The authority to convene courts-martial is independent of rank and

is retained as long as the convening authority remains a commander in one

of the designated positions. The rule by which command devolves are found

in regulations of the Secretary concerned.

#### (2) Special courts-martial.

Unless otherwise limited by superior competent authority, special

courts-martial may be convened by persons occupying positions designated

in Article 23(a) and by commanders designated by the Secretary concerned.

##### Discussion

_See_ the discussion of subsection (b)(1) of this

rule. Persons authorized to convene general courts-martial may also convene

special courts-martial.

##### (A) Definition.

For purposes of Articles 23 and 24, a command or unit is "separate

or detached" when isolated or removed from the immediate disciplinary

control of a superior in such manner as to make its commander the person held

 by superior commanders primarily responsible for discipline. "Separate

or detached" is used in a disciplinary sense and not necessarily in

a tactical or physical sense. A subordinate joint command or joint task force is ordinarily considered to be "separate or detached."

###### Discussion

The power of a commander of a separate or detached unit to convene

courts-martial, like that of any other commander, may be limited by superior

competent authority.

##### (B) Determination.

If a commander is in doubt whether the command is separate or detached,

the matter shall be determined:

(i) In the Army or the Air Force, by the officer exercising general

court-martial jurisdiction over the command; or

(ii) In the Naval Service or Coast Guard, by the flag or general officer

in command or the senior officer present who designated the detachment; or

(iii) In a combatant command or joint command, by the officer exercising general

court-martial jurisdiction over the command.

#### (3) Summary courts-martial.

_See_ R.C.M. 1302(a).

##### Discussion

_See_ the discussion under subsection (b)(1) of this

 rule.

#### (4) Delegation prohibited.

The power to convene courts-martial may not be delegated.

### (c) Disqualification.

#### (1) Accuser.

An accuser may not convene a general or special court-martial for

the trial of the person accused.

##### Discussion

_See also_ Article 1(9); 307(a); 601(c). However, _

 see_ R.C.M. 1302(b) (accuser may convene a summary court-martial).

#### (2) Other.

A convening authority junior in rank to an accuser may not convene

a general or special court-martial for the trial of the accused unless that

convening authority is superior in command to the accuser. A convening authority

junior in command to an accuser may not convene a general or special court-martial

 for the trial of the accused.

#### (3) Action when disqualified.

When a commander who would otherwise convene a general or special

court-martial is disqualified in a case, the charges shall be forwarded to

a superior competent authority for disposition. That authority may personally

dispose of the charges or forward the charges to another convening authority

who is superior in rank to the accuser, or, if in the same chain of command,

who is superior in command to the accuser.

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 401(c).

### (d) Convening orders.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

A convening order for a general or special court-martial shall designate

the type of court-martial and detail the members and may designate where

the court-martial will meet. If the convening authority has been designated

by the Secretary concerned, the convening order shall so state.

##### Discussion

_See_ Appendix 6 for a suggested format for a convening

order.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

A convening order for a summary court-martial shall designate that

it is a summary court-martial and detail the summary court-martial, and may

designate where the court-martial will meet. If the convening authority has

been designated by the Secretary concerned, the convening order shall so state.

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 1302(c).

#### (3) Additional matters.

Additional matters to be included in convening orders may be prescribed

by the Secretary concerned.

### (e) Place.

The convening authority shall ensure that an appropriate location

and facilities for courts-martial are provided.

## Rule 505. Changes of members, military judge, and counsel

### (a) In general.

Subject to this rule, the members, military judge, and counsel may

be changed by an authority competent to detail such persons. Members also

may be excused as provided in subsections (c)(1)(B)(ii) and (c)(2)(A) of

this rule.

#### Discussion

Changes of the members of the court-martial should be kept to a

minimum. If extensive changes are necessary and no session of the court-martial

has begun, it may be appropriate to withdraw the charges from one court-martial

and refer them to another. _See_ R.C.M. 604.

### (b) Procedure.

When new persons are added as members or counsel or when substitutions

are made as to any members or counsel or the military judge, such persons

shall be detailed in accordance with R.C.M. 503. An order changing the members

of the court-martial, except one which excuses members without replacement,

shall be reduced to writing before authentication of the record of trial.

#### Discussion

When members or counsel have been excused and the excusal is not

reduced to writing, the excusal should be announced on the record. A member

who has been temporarily excused need not be formally reappointed to the

court-martial.

### (c) Changes of members.

#### (1) Before assembly.

##### (A) By convening authority.

Before the court-martial is assembled, the convening authority may

change the members of the court-martial without showing cause.

##### (B) By convening authority's delegate.

###### (i) Delegation.

The convening authority may delegate, under regulations of the Secretary

concerned, authority to excuse individual members to the staff judge advocate

or legal officer or other principal assistant to the convening authority.

###### (ii) Limitations.

Before the court-martial is assembled, the convening authority's

delegate may excuse members without cause shown; however, no more than one-third

of the total number of members detailed by the convening authority may be

 excused by the convening authority's delegate in any one court-martial. After

assembly the convening authority's delegate may not excuse members.

#### (2) After assembly.

##### (A) Excusal.

After assembly no member may be excused, except:

(i) By the convening authority for good cause shown on the record;

(ii) By the military judge for good cause shown on the record; or

(iii) As a result of challenge under R.C.M. 912.

##### (B) New members.

New members may be detailed after assembly only when, as a result

of excusals under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this rule, the number of members

of the court-martial is reduced below a quorum, or the number of enlisted

members, when the accused has made a timely written request for enlisted

members, is reduced below one-third of the total membership.

### (d) Changes of detailed counsel.

#### (1) Trial counsel.

An authority competent to detail trial counsel may change the trial

counsel and any assistant trial counsel at any time without showing cause.

#### (2) Defense counsel.

##### (A)  Before formation of attorney-client relationship.

Before an attorney-client relationship has been formed between the

accused and detailed defense counsel or associate or assistant defense counsel,

an authority competent to detail defense counsel may excuse or change such

 counsel without showing cause.

##### (B) After formation of attorney-client relationship.

After an attorney-client relationship has been formed between the

accused and detailed defense counsel or associate or assistant defense counsel,

an authority competent to detail such counsel may excuse or change such counsel

only:

(i) Under R.C.M. 506(b)(3);

(ii) Upon request of the accused or application for withdrawal by such

counsel under R.C.M. 506(c); or

(iii) For other good cause shown on the record.

### (e) Change of military judge.

#### (1) Before assembly.

Before the court-martial is assembled, the military judge may be

changed by an authority competent to detail the military judge, without cause

shown on the record.

#### (2) After assembly.

After the court-martial is assembled, the military judge may be

changed by an authority competent to detail the military judge only when,

as a result of disqualification under R.C.M. 902 or for good cause shown,

the previously detailed military judge is unable to proceed.

### (f) Good cause.

For purposes of this rule, "good cause" includes physical

disability, military exigency, and other extraordinary circumstances which

render the member, counsel, or military judge unable to proceed with the

court-martial within a reasonable time. "Good cause" does not

include temporary inconveniences which are incident to normal conditions

of military life.

## Rule 506. Accused's rights to counsel

### (a) In general.

The accused has the right to be represented before a general or

special court-martial by civilian counsel if provided at no expense to the

Government, and either by the military counsel detailed under Article 27

or military counsel of the accused's own selection, if reasonably available.

The accused is not entitled to be represented by more than one military counsel.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 502(d)(3) as to qualifications of civilian

counsel or individual military counsel.

### (b) Individual military counsel.

#### (1) Reasonably available.

Subject to this subsection, the Secretary concerned shall define

"reasonably available." While so assigned, the following persons

are not reasonably available to serve as individual military counsel because

of the nature of their duties or positions:

(A) A general or flag officer;

(B) A trial or appellate military judge;

(C) A trial counsel;

(D) An appellate defense or government counsel;

(E) A principal legal advisor to a command, organization, or agency

and, when such command, organization, or agency has general court-martial

jurisdiction, the principal assistant of such an advisor;

(F) An instructor or student at a service school or academy:

(G) A student at a college or university;

(H) A member of the staff of the Judge Advocate General of the Army,

Navy, or Air Force, the Chief Counsel of the Coast Guard, or the Director,

Judge Advocate Division, Headquarters, Marine Corps.

 The Secretary

concerned may determine other persons to be not reasonably available because

of the nature or responsibilities of their assignments, geographic considerations,

exigent circumstances, or military necessity. A person who is a member of

an armed force different from that of which the accused is a member shall

be reasonably available to serve as individual military counsel for such accused

to the same extent as that person is available to serve as individual military

counsel for an accused in the same armed force as the person requested. The

Secretary concerned may prescribe circumstances under which exceptions may

 be made to the prohibitions in this subsection when merited by the existence

of an attorney-client relationship regarding matters relating to a charge

in question. However, if the attorney-client relationship arose solely because

the counsel represented the accused on review under Article 70, this exception

shall not apply.

#### (2) Procedure.

Subject to this subsection, the Secretary concerned shall prescribe

procedures for determining whether a requested person is "reasonably

available" to act as individual military counsel. Requests for an individual

military counsel shall be made by the accused or the detailed defense counsel

through the trial counsel to the convening authority. If the requested person

is among those not reasonably available under subsection (b)(1) of this rule

or under regulations of the Secretary concerned, the convening authority shall

deny the request and notify the accused, unless the accused asserts that

there is an existing attorney-client relationship regarding a charge in question

or that the person requested will not, at the time of the trial or investigation

for which requested, be among those so listed as not reasonably available.

If the accused's request makes such a claim, or if the person is not among

those so listed as not reasonably available, the convening authority shall

forward the request to the commander or head of the organization, activity,

or agency to which the requested person is assigned. That authority shall

make an administrative determination whether the requested person is reasonably

available in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

This determination is a matter within the sole discretion of that authority.

An adverse determination may be reviewed upon request of the accused through

that authority to the next higher commander or level of supervision, but

no administrative review may be made which requires action at the departmental

or higher level.

#### (3) Excusal of detailed counsel.

If the accused is represented by individual military counsel, detailed

defense counsel shall normally be excused. The authority who detailed the

defense counsel, as a matter of discretion, may approve a request from the

accused that detailed defense counsel shall act as associate counsel. The

action of the authority who detailed the counsel is subject to review only

for abuse of discretion.

##### Discussion

A request under subsection (b)(3) should be considered in light

of the general statutory policy that the accused is not entitled to be represented

by more than one military counsel. Among the factors that may be considered

 in the exercise of discretion are the seriousness of the case, retention

of civilian defense counsel, complexity of legal or factual issues, and the

detail of additional trial counsel.

  _See_ R.C.M.

905(b)(6) and 906(b)(2) as to motions concerning denial of a request for

individual military counsel or retention of detailed counsel as associate

counsel.

### (c) Excusal or withdrawal.

Except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 505(d)(2) and subsection

(b)(3) of this rule, defense counsel may be excused only with the express

consent of the accused, or by the military judge upon application for withdrawal

 by the defense counsel for good cause shown.

### (d) Waiver.

The accused may expressly waive the right to be represented by counsel

and may thereafter conduct the defense personally. Such waiver shall be accepted

by the military judge only if the military judge finds that the accused is

competent to understand the disadvantages of self-representation and that

the waiver is voluntary and understanding. The military judge may require

that a defense counsel remain present even if the accused waives counsel

and conducts the defense personally. The right of the accused to conduct the

defense personally may be revoked if the accused is disruptive or fails to

follow basic rules of decorum and procedure.

### (e) Nonlawyer present.

Subject to the discretion of the military judge, the accused may

have present and seated at the counsel table for purpose of consultation

persons not qualified to serve as counsel under R.C.M. 502.

#### Discussion

_See_ also Mil. R. Evid. 615 if the person is a potential

witness in the case.

# CHAPTER VI. REFERRAL, SERVICE, AMENDMENT, AND WITHDRAWAL OF CHARGES

## Rule 601. Referral

### (a) In general.

Referral is the order of a convening authority that charges against

an accused will be tried by a specified court-martial.

#### Discussion

Referral of charges requires three elements: a convening authority

who is authorized to convene the court-martial and is not disqualified

(_see_ R.C.M. 601(b) and (c)); preferred charges which have been received

by the convening authority for disposition (_see_ R.C.M. 307

as to preferral of charges and Chapter IV as to disposition); and a court-martial

convened by that convening authority or a predecessor (_see_ R.C.M.

504).

  If trial would be warranted but would be detrimental

to the prosecution of a war or inimical to national security, _see

_ R.C.M. 401(d) and 407(b).

### (b) Who may refer.

Any convening authority may refer charges to a court-martial convened

by that convening authority or a predecessor, unless the power to do so has

been withheld by superior competent authority.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 306(a), 403, 404, 407, and 504.

  The

convening authority may be of any command, including a command different from

that of the accused, but as a practical matter the accused must be subject

to the orders of the convening authority or otherwise under the convening

authority's control to assure the appearance of the accused at trial. The

 convening authority's power over the accused may be based upon agreements

between the commanders concerned.

### (c) Disqualification.

An accuser may not refer charges to a general or special court-martial.

#### Discussion

Convening authorities are not disqualified from referring charges

by prior participation in the same case except when they have acted as accuser.

For a definition of "accuser," _see_ Article 1(9).

 A convening authority who is disqualified may forward the charges and allied

papers for disposition by competent authority superior in rank or command. _

See_ R.C.M. 401(c) concerning actions which the superior may take.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1302 for rules relating to convening summary courts-martial.

### (d) When charges may be referred.

#### (1) Basis for referral.

If the convening authority finds or is advised by a judge advocate

 that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offense triable by a

court-martial has been committed and that the accused committed it, and that

the specification alleges an offense, the convening authority may refer it.

The finding may be based on hearsay in whole or in part. The convening authority

or judge advocate may consider information from any source and shall not

be limited to the information reviewed by any previous authority, but a case

may not be referred to a general court-martial except in compliance with

subsection (d)(2) of this rule. The convening authority or judge advocate

shall not be required before charges are referred to resolve legal issues,

including objections to evidence, which may arise at trial.

##### Discussion

For a discussion of selection among alternative dispositions, _

see_ R.C.M. 306. The convening authority is not obliged to refer all

 charges which the evidence might support. The convening authority should

consider the options and considerations under R.C.M. 306 in exercising the

discretion to refer.

#### (2) General courts-martial.

The convening authority may not refer a specification under a charge

 to a general court-martial unless-

(A) There has been substantial compliance with the pretrial investigation

requirements of R.C.M. 405; and

(B) The convening authority has received the advice of the staff judge

advocate required under R.C.M. 406. These requirements may be waived by the

accused.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(C) concerning limitations

on referral of capital offenses to special courts-martial. _See_ R.C.M.

103(3) for the definition of a capital offense.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1301(c) concerning limitations on the referral of certain

cases to summary courts-martial.

### (e) How charges shall be referred.

#### (1) Order, instructions.

Referral shall be by the personal order of the convening authority.

The convening authority may include proper instructions in the order.

##### Discussion

Referral is ordinarily evidenced by an indorsement on the charge

sheet. Although the indorsement should be completed on all copies of the

charge sheet, only the original must be signed. The signature may be that

of a person acting by the order or direction of the convening authority. In

such a case the signature element must reflect the signer's authority.

  If,

for any reason, charges are referred to a court-martial different from that

to which they were originally referred, the new referral is ordinarily made

by a new indorsement attached to the original charge sheet. The previous

indorsement should be lined out and initialed by the person signing the new

referral. The original indorsement should not be obliterated. _See

also_ R.C.M. 604.

  If the only officer present in

a command refers the charges to a summary court-martial and serves as the

summary court-martial under R.C.M. 1302, the indorsement should be completed

with the additional comments, "only officer present in the command."

  The

convening authority may instruct that the charges against the accused be tried

with certain other charges against the accused. _See_ subsection

(2) below.

  The convening authority may instruct that charges

against one accused be referred for joint or common trial with another accused. _

See_ subsection (3) below.

  The convening authority shall indicate that the case is to be tried as a capital case by including a special instruction in the referral block of the charge sheet.  Failure to include this special instruction at the time of the referral shall not bar the convening authority from later adding the required special instruction, provided that the convening authority has otherwise complied with the applicable notice requirements.  If the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure to include the special instruction, a continuance or a recess is an adequate remedy.

  The convening authority should acknowledge

by an instruction that a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than

six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged

when the prerequisites under Article 19 will not be met. _See_ R.C.M.

201(f)(2)(B)(ii). For example, this instruction may be given when a court

reporter is not detailed.

  Any special instructions must

be stated in the referral indorsement.

  When the charges

have been referred to a court-martial, the indorsed charge sheet and allied

 papers should be promptly transmitted to the trial counsel.

#### (2) Joinder of offenses.

In the discretion of the convening authority, two or more offenses

charged against an accused may be referred to the same court-martial for

trial, whether serious or minor offenses or both, regardless whether related.

Additional charges may be joined with other charges for a single trial at

any time before arraignment if all necessary procedural requirements concerning

the additional charges have been complied with. After arraignment of the

accused upon charges, no additional charges may be referred to the same trial

without consent of the accused.

##### Discussion

Ordinarily all known charges should be referred to a single court-martial.

#### (3) Joinder of accused.

Allegations against two or more accused may be referred for joint

trial if the accused are alleged to have participated in the same act or

transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an

offense or offenses. Such accused may be charged in one or more specifications

together or separately, and every accused need not be charged in each specification.

Related allegations against two or more accused which may be proved by substantially

the same evidence may be referred to a common trial.

##### Discussion

A joint offense is one committed by two or more persons acting together

with a common intent. Joint offenses may be referred for joint trial, along

with all related offenses against each of the accused. A common trial may

be used when the evidence of several offenses committed by several accused

separately is essentially the same, even though the offenses were not jointly

committed. _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5) Discussion. Convening authorities

should consider that joint and common trials may be complicated by procedural

and evidentiary rules.

### (f) Superior convening authorities.

Except as otherwise provided in these rules, a superior competent

authority may cause charges, whether or not referred, to be transmitted to

the authority for further consideration, including, if appropriate, referral.

### (g) Parallel convening authorities.

If it is impracticable for the original convening authority to continue exercising authority over the charges, the convening authority may cause the charges, even if referred, to be transmitted to a parallel convening authority. This transmittal must be in writing and in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe. Subsequent actions taken by the parallel convening authority are within the sole discretion of that convening authority.

#### Discussion

 Parallel convening authorities are those convening authorities that possess the same court-martial jurisdiction authority. Examples of permissible transmittal of charges under this rule include the transmittal from a general court-martial convening authority to another general court-martial convening authority, or from one special court-martial convening authority to another special court-martial convening authority. It would be impracticable for an original convening authority to continue exercising authority over the charges, for example, when a command is being decommissioned or inactivated, or when deploying or redeploying and the accused is remaining behind. If charges have been referred, there is no requirement that the charges be withdrawn or dismissed prior to transfer. _See_ R.C.M. 604. In the event that the case has been referred, the receiving convening authority may adopt the original court-martial convening order, including the court-martial panel selected to hear the case as indicated in that convening order. When charges are transmitted under this rule, no recommendation as to disposition may be made.

## Rule 602. Service of charges

The trial counsel detailed to the court-martial to which charges

have been referred for trial shall cause to be served upon each accused a

copy of the charge sheet. In time of peace, no person may, over objection,

be brought to trial-including an Article 39(a) session-before

a general court-martial within a period of five days after service of charges,

or before a special court-martial within a period of three days after service

of charges. In computing these periods, the date of service of charges and

the date of trial are excluded; holidays and Sundays are included.

### Discussion

Trial counsel should comply with this rule immediately upon receipt

of the charges. Whenever after service the charges are amended or changed

the trial counsel must give notice of the changes to the defense counsel.

Whenever such amendments or changes add a new party, a new offense, or substantially

new allegations, the charge sheet so amended or changed must be served anew. _

See also_ R.C.M. 603.

  Service may be made only upon

the accused; substitute service upon defense counsel is insufficient. The

trial counsel should promptly inform the defense counsel when charges have

been served.

  If the accused has questions when served with

charges, the accused should be told to discuss the matter with defense counsel.

## Rule 603. Changes to charges and specifications

### (a) Minor changes defined.

Minor changes in charges and specifications are any except those

which add a party, offenses, or substantial matter not fairly included in

those previously preferred, or which are likely to mislead the accused as

to the offenses charged.

#### Discussion

Minor changes include those necessary to correct inartfully drafted

or redundant specifications; to correct a misnaming of the accused; to allege

the proper article; or to correct other slight errors. Minor charges also

include those which reduce the seriousness of an offense, as when the value

of an allegedly stolen item in a larceny specification is reduced, or when

a desertion specification is amended to allege only unauthorized absence.

### (b) Minor changes before arraignment.

Any person forwarding, acting upon, or prosecuting charges on behalf

of the United States except a preliminary hearing officer appointed under R.C.M.

405 may make minor changes to charges or specifications before arraignment.

#### Discussion

Charges forwarded or referred for trial should be free from defects

of form and substance. Minor errors may be corrected and the charge may be

redrafted without being sworn anew by the accuser. Other changes should be

signed and sworn to by an accuser. All changes in the charges should be initialed

by the person who makes them. A trial counsel acting under this provision

ordinarily should consult with the convening authority before making any changes

 which, even though minor, change the nature or seriousness of the offense.

### (c) Minor changes after arraignment.

After arraignment the military judge may, upon motion, permit minor

changes in the charges and specifications at any time before findings are

announced if no substantial right of the accused is prejudiced.

### (d) Major changes.

Changes or amendments to charges or specifications other than minor

changes may not be made over the objection of the accused unless the charge

or specification affected is preferred anew.

#### Discussion

If there has been a major change or amendment over the accused's

objection to a charge already referred, a new referral is necessary. Similarly,

in the case of a general court-martial, a new investigation under R.C.M.

405 will be necessary if the charge as amended or changed was not covered

in the prior investigation. If the substance of the charge or specification

as amended or changed has not been referred or, in the case of a general

court-martial, investigated, a new referral and, if appropriate, investigation

are necessary. When charges are re-referred, they must be served anew under

R.C.M. 602.

## Rule 604. Withdrawal of charges

### (a) Withdrawal.

The convening authority or a superior competent authority may for

any reason cause any charges or specifications to be withdrawn from a court-martial

at any time before findings are announced.

#### Discussion

Charges which are withdrawn from a court-martial should be dismissed

(_see_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1)) unless it is intended to refer them

anew promptly or to forward them to another authority for disposition.

  Charges

should not be withdrawn from a court-martial arbitrarily or unfairly to an

accused. _See also_ subsection (b) of this rule.

  Some

or all charges and specifications may be withdrawn. In a joint or common trial

the withdrawal may be limited to charges against one or some of the accused.

  Charges

which have been properly referred to a court-martial may be withdrawn only

by the direction of the convening authority or a superior competent authority

in the exercise of that officer's independent judgment. When directed to

do so by the convening authority or a superior competent authority, trial

counsel may withdraw charges or specifications by lining out the affected

charges or specifications, renumbering remaining charges or specifications

as necessary, and initialing the changes. Charges and specifications withdrawn

before commencement of trial will not be brought to the attention of the

members. When charges or specifications are withdrawn after they have come

to the attention of the members, the military judge must instruct them that

the withdrawn charges or specifications may not be considered for any reason.

### (b) Referral of withdrawn charges.

Charges which have been withdrawn from a court-martial may be referred

to another court-martial unless the withdrawal was for an improper reason.

Charges withdrawn after the introduction of evidence on the general issue

 of guilt may be referred to another court-martial only if the withdrawal

was necessitated by urgent and unforeseen military necessity.

#### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 915 (Mistrial).

  When

charges which have been withdrawn from a court-martial are referred to another

court-martial, the reasons for the withdrawal and later referral should be

included in the record of the later court-martial, if the later referral

is more onerous to the accused. Therefore, if further prosecution is contemplated

at the time of the withdrawal, the reasons for the withdrawal should be included

in or attached to the record of the earlier proceeding.

  Improper

reasons for withdrawal include an intent to interfere with the free exercise

by the accused of constitutional rights or rights provided under the code, or with the impartiality

of a court-martial. A withdrawal is improper if it was not directed personally

and independently by the convening authority or by a superior competent authority.

  Whether

the reason for a withdrawal is proper, for purposes of the propriety of a

later referral, depends in part on the stage in the proceedings at which

the withdrawal takes place. Before arraignment, there are many reasons for

a withdrawal which will not preclude another referral. These include receipt

 of additional charges, absence of the accused, reconsideration by the convening

authority or by a superior competent authority of the seriousness of the

offenses, questions concerning the mental capacity of the accused, and routine

duty rotation of the personnel constituting the court-martial. Charges withdrawn

after arraignment may be referred to another court-martial under some circumstances.

For example, it is permissible to refer charges which were withdrawn pursuant

to a pretrial agreement if the accused fails to fulfill the terms of the

agreement. _See_ R.C.M. 705. Charges withdrawn after some evidence

on the general issue of guilty is introduced may be re-referred only under

the narrow circumstances described in the rule.

# CHAPTER VII. PRETRIAL MATTERS

## Rule 701. Discovery

### (a) Disclosure by the trial counsel.

or places, or copies of portions thereof, which are within the possession,

custody, or control of military authorities, and which are material to the

preparation of the defense or are intended for use by the trial counsel as

evidence in the prosecution case-in-chief at trial, or were obtained from

or belong to the accused; and

(B) Any results or reports of physical or mental examinations, and of

scientific tests or experiments, or copies thereof, which are within the

possession, custody, or control of military authorities, the existence of

which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the

trial counsel, and which are material to the preparation of the defense or

are intended for use by the trial counsel as evidence in the prosecution

case-in-chief at trial.

###### Discussion

For specific rules concerning certain mental examinations of the

accused or third party patients, _see_ R.C.M. 701(f), R.C.M.

706, Mil. R. Evid. 302 and Mil. R. Evid. 513.

#### (3) Witnesses.

Before the beginning of trial on the merits the trial counsel shall

notify the defense of the names and addresses of the witnesses the trial

counsel intends to call:

(A) In the prosecution case-in-chief; and

(B) To rebut a defense of alibi, innocent ingestion, or lack of mental

responsibility, when trial counsel has received timely notice under subsection

(b)(1) or (2) of this rule.

###### Discussion

Such notice should be in writing except when impracticable.

#### (4) Prior convictions of accused offered on the merits.

Before arraignment the trial counsel shall notify the defense of

any records of prior civilian or court-martial convictions of the accused

of which the trial counsel is aware and which the trial counsel may offer

on the merits for any purpose, including impeachment, and shall permit the

defense to inspect such records when they are in the trial counsel's possession.

#### (5) Information to be offered at sentencing.

Upon request of the defense the trial counsel shall:

(A) Permit the defense to inspect such written material as will be

presented by the prosecution at the presentencing proceedings; and

(B) Notify the defense of the names and addresses of the witnesses the

 trial counsel intends to call at the presentencing proceedings under R.C.M.

1001(b).

#### (6) Evidence favorable to the defense.

The trial counsel shall, as soon as practicable, disclose to the

 defense the existence of evidence known to the trial counsel which reasonably

tends to:

(A) Negate the guilt of the accused of an offense charged;

(B) Reduce the degree of guilt of the accused of an offense charged;

or

(C) Reduce the punishment.

###### Discussion

In addition to the matters required to be disclosed under subsection

(a) of this rule, the Government is required to notify the defense of or

provide to the defense certain information under other rules. Mil. R. Evid.

506 covers the disclosure of unclassified information which is under the control

 of the Government. Mil. R. Evid. 505 covers disclosure of classified information.

  Other

R.C.M. and Mil. R. Evid. concern disclosure of other specific matters. _

See_ R.C.M. 308 (identification of accuser), 405 (report of Article 32 preliminary hearing), 706(c)(3)(B) (mental examination of accused), 914 (production

of certain statements), and 1004(b)(1) (aggravating circumstances in capital

cases); Mil. R. Evid. 301(c)(2) (notice of immunity or leniency to witnesses),

302 (mental examination of accused), 304(d)(1) (statements by accused), 311(d)(1)

(evidence seized from accused), 321(c)(1) (evidence based on lineups), 507

(identity of informants), 612 (memoranda used to refresh recollection), and

613(a) (prior inconsistent statements).

  Requirements for

notice of intent to use certain evidence are found in: Mil. R. Evid. 201A(b)

(judicial notice of foreign law), 301(c)(2) (immunized witnesses), 304(d)(2)

(notice of intent to use undisclosed confessions), 304(f) (testimony of accused

for limited purpose on confession), 311(d)(2)(B) (notice of intent to use

undisclosed evidence seized), 311(f) (testimony of accused for limited purpose

on seizures), 321(c)(2)(B) (notice of intent to use undisclosed line-up evidence),

321(e) (testimony of accused for limited purpose of line-ups), 412(c)(1)

and (2) (intent of defense to use evidence of sexual misconduct by a victim);

505(h) (intent to disclose classified information), 506(h) (intent to disclose

privilege government information), and 609(b) (intent to impeach with conviction

over 10 years old).

### (b) Disclosure by the defense.

Except as otherwise provided in subsections (f) and (g)(2) of this

rule, the defense shall provide the following information to the trial counsel-

#### (1) Names of witnesses and statements.

(A) Before the beginning of trial on the merits, the defense shall notify

the trial counsel of the names and addresses of all witnesses, other than

the accused, whom the defense intends to call during the defense case in

chief, and provide all sworn or signed statements known by the defense to

have been made by such witnesses in connection with the case.

(B) Upon request of the trial counsel, the defense shall also

(i) Provide the trial counsel with the names and addresses of any witnesses

whom the defense intends to call at the presentencing proceedings under R.C.M.

1001(c); and

(ii) Permit the trial counsel to inspect any written material that will

be presented by the defense at the presentencing proceeding.

####### Discussion

Such notice shall be in writing except when impracticable. _

See_ R.C.M. 701(f) for statements that would not be subject to disclosure.

#### (2) Notice of certain defenses.

The defense shall notify the trial counsel before the beginning

of trial on the merits of its intent to offer the defense of alibi, innocent

ingestion, or lack of mental responsibility, or its intent to introduce expert

testimony as to the accused's mental condition. Such notice by the defense

shall disclose, in the case of an alibi defense, the place or places at which

the defense claims the accused to have been at the time of the alleged offense,

and, in the case of an innocent ingestion defense, the place or places where,

and the circumstances under which the defense claims the accused innocently

ingested the substance in question, and the names and addresses of the witnesses

upon whom the accused intends to rely to establish any such defenses.

##### Discussion

Such notice should be in writing except when impracticable. _

See_ R.C.M. 916(k) concerning the defense of lack of mental responsibility. _

See_ R.C.M. 706 concerning inquiries into the mental responsibility

of the accused. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 302 concerning statements

by the accused during such inquiries. If the defense needs more detail as

to the time, date, or place of the offense to comply with this rule, it should

request a bill of particulars. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(6).

#### (3) Documents and tangible objects.

If the defense requests disclosure under subsection (a)(2)(A) of

this rule, upon compliance with such request by the Government, the defense,

on request of the trial counsel, shall permit the trial counsel to inspect

 books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, or copies or portions

thereof, which are within the possession, custody, or control of the defense

and which the defense intends to introduce as evidence in the defense case-in-chief

at trial.

#### (4) Reports of examination and tests.

If the defense requests disclosure under subsection (a)(2)(B) of

this rule, upon compliance with such request by the Government, the defense,

on request of trial counsel, shall (except as provided in R.C.M. 706, Mil.

R. Evid. 302, and Mil. R. Evid. 513) permit the trial counsel to inspect

any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific

tests or experiments made in connection with the particular case, or copies

thereof, that are within the possession, custody, or control of the defense

that the defense intends to introduce as evidence in the defense case-in-chief

at trial or that were prepared by a witness whom the defense intends to call

at trial when the results or reports relate to that witness' testimony.

#### (5) Inadmissibility of withdrawn defense.

If an intention to rely upon a defense under subsection (b)(2) of

this rule is withdrawn, evidence of such intention and disclosures by the

accused or defense counsel made in connection with such intention is not,

in any court-martial, admissible against the accused who gave notice of the

intention.

##### Discussion

In addition to the matters covered in subsection (b) of this rule,

defense counsel is required to give notice or disclose evidence under certain

Military Rules of Evidence: Mil. R. Evid. 201A(b) (judicial notice of foreign

law), 304(f) (testimony by the accused for a limited purpose in relation to

 a confession), 311(b) (same, search), 321(e) (same, lineup), 412(c)(1) and

(2) (intent to offer evidence of sexual misconduct by a victim), 505(h) (intent

to disclose classified information), 506(h) (intent to disclose privileged

government information), 609(b) (intent to impeach a witness with a conviction

older than 10 years), 612(2) (writing used to refresh recollection), and

613(a) (prior inconsistent statements).

### (c) Failure to call witness.

The fact that a witness' name is on a list of expected or intended

witnesses provided to an opposing party, whether required by this rule or

not, shall not be ground for comment upon a failure to call the witness.

### (d) Continuing duty to disclose.

If, before or during the court-martial, a party discovers additional

evidence or material previously requested or required to be produced, which

is subject to discovery or inspection under this rule, that party shall promptly

notify the other party or the military judge of the existence of the additional

evidence or material.

### (e) Access to witnesses and evidence.

Each party shall have adequate opportunity to prepare its case and equal opportunity to interview witnesses and inspect evidence, subject to the limitations in subsection (e)(1) of this rule. No party may unreasonably impede the access of another party to a witness or evidence.

#### (1) Counsel for the Accused Interview of Victim of Alleged Sex-Related Offense.

(A) Upon notice by counsel for the government to counsel for the accused of the name of an alleged victim of a sex-related offense whom counsel for the government intends to call to testify at a court-martial, counsel for the accused, or that lawyer's representative, as defined in Mil. R. Evid. 502(b)(3), shall make any request to interview that victim through special victims' counsel or other counsel for the victim, if applicable.

(B) If requested by an alleged victim of a sex-related offense who is subject to a request for interview under subsection (e)(1)(A) of this rule, any interview of the victim by counsel for the accused, or that lawyer's representative, as defined in Mil. R. Evid. 502(b)(3), shall take place only in the presence of counsel for the government, counsel for the victim, or a sexual assault victim advocate.

(C) In this subsection, the term "sex-related offense" means-

(i) a violation of Article 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, or 125; or

(ii) an attempt to commit an offense specified in subsection (e)(1)(C)(i) of this rule under Article 80.

####### Discussion

Convening authorities, commanders and members of their immediate

staffs should make no statement, oral or written, and take no action which

could reasonably be understood to discourage or prevent witnesses from testifying

 truthfully before a court-martial, or as a threat of retribution for such

testimony.

 Article 46(b), enacted by section 1704 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, as amended by section 531(b) of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291, 19 December 2014, is implemented by this rule.

 Counsel must remain cognizant of professional responsibility rules regarding communicating with represented persons.

### (f) Information not subject to disclosure.

Nothing in this rule shall be construed to require the disclosure

of information protected from disclosure by the Military Rules of Evidence.

Nothing in this rule shall require the disclosure or production of notes,

memoranda, or similar working papers prepared by counsel and counsel's assistants

and representatives.

### (g) Regulation of discovery.

#### (1) Time, place, and manner.

The military judge may, consistent with this rule, specify the time,

place, and manner of making discovery and may prescribe such terms and conditions

as are just.

#### (2) Protective and modifying orders.

Upon a sufficient showing the military judge may at any time order

that the discovery or inspection be denied, restricted, or deferred, or make

such other order as is appropriate. Upon motion by a party, the military

judge may permit the party to make such showing, in whole or in part, in writing

to be inspected only by the military judge. If the military judge grants

relief after such an ex parte showing, the entire text of the party's statement

shall be sealed and attached to the record of trial as an appellate exhibit.

Such material may be examined by reviewing authorities in closed proceedings

for the purpose of reviewing the determination of the military judge.

#### (3) Failure to comply.

If at any time during the court-martial it is brought to the attention

of the military judge that a party has failed to comply with this rule, the

military judge may take one or more of the following actions:

(A) Order the party to permit discovery;

(B) Grant a continuance;

(C) Prohibit the party from introducing evidence, calling a witness,

or raising a defense not disclosed; and

(D) Enter such other order as is just under the circumstances. This

rule shall not limit the right of the accused to testify in the accused's

behalf.

###### Discussion

Factors to be considered in determining whether to grant an exception

to exclusion under subsection (3)(C) include: the extent of disadvantage

that resulted from a failure to disclose; the reason for the failure to disclose;

the extent to which later events mitigated the disadvantage caused by the

failure to disclose; and any other relevant factors.

  The

sanction of excluding the testimony of a defense witness should be used only

upon finding that the defense counsel's failure to comply with this rule

was willful and motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage or to

conceal a plan to present fabricated testimony. Moreover, the sanction of

excluding the testimony of a defense witness should only be used if alternative

sanctions could not have minimized the prejudice to the Government. Before

imposing this sanction, the military judge must weigh the defendant's right

 to compulsory process against the countervailing public interests, including

(1) the integrity of the adversary process; (2) the interest in the fair

and efficient administration of military justice; and (3) the potential prejudice

to the truth-determining function of the trial process.

  Procedures

governing refusal to disclose classified information are in Mil. R. Evid.

505. Procedures governing refusal to disclose other government information

are in Mil. R. Evid. 506. Procedures governing refusal to disclose an informant's

identity are in Mil. R. Evid. 507.

### (h) Inspect.

As used in this rule "inspect" includes the right to

photograph and copy.

## Rule 702. Depositions

### (a) In general.

A deposition may be ordered whenever, after preferral of charges, due to exceptional circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness be taken and preserved for use at a preliminary hearing under Article 32 or a court-martial. A victim's declination to testify at a preliminary hearing or a victim's declination to submit to pretrial interviews shall not, by themselves, be considered exceptional circumstances. In accordance with subsection (b) of this rule below, the convening authority or military judge may order a deposition of a victim only if it is determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the victim will not be available to testify at court-martial.

#### Discussion

A deposition is the out-of-court testimony of a witness under oath

in response to questions by the parties, which is reduced to writing or recorded

on videotape or audiotape or similar material. A deposition taken on oral

examination is an oral deposition, and a deposition taken on written interrogatories

is a written deposition. Written interrogatories are questions, prepared

by the prosecution, defense, or both, which are reduced to writing before

submission to a witness whose testimony is to be taken by deposition. The

answers, reduced to writing and properly sworn to, constitute the deposition

testimony of the witness.

  Note that under subsection (i)

of this rule a deposition may be taken by agreement of the parties without

necessity of an order.

  A deposition may be taken to preserve

the testimony of a witness who is likely to be unavailable at the investigation

under Article 32 (_see_ R.C.M. 405(g)) or at the time of trial

(_see_ R.C.M. 703(b)). Part of all or a deposition, so far

as otherwise admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence, may be used

on the merits or on an interlocutory question as substantive evidence if the

witness is unavailable under Mil. R. Evid. 804(a) except that a deposition

may be admitted in a capital case only upon offer by the defense. _

See_ Mil. R. Evid. 804(b)(1). In any case, a deposition may be used

by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony

of the deponent as a witness. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 613. If

only a part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse

party may require the proponent to offer all which is relevant to the part

offered, and any party may offer other parts. _See_ Mil. R.

Evid. 106.

  A deposition which is transcribed is ordinarily

read to the court-martial by the party offering it. _See also_ subsection

(g)(3) of this rule. The transcript of a deposition may not be inspected by

the members. Objections may be made to testimony in a written deposition

in the same way that they would be if the testimony were offered through

the personal appearance of a witness.

  Part or all of a deposition

so far as otherwise admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence may be

used in presentencing proceedings as substantive evidence as provided in R.C.M.

1001.

  DD Form 456 (Interrogatories and Deposition) may be

used in conjunction with this rule.

### (b) Who may order.

A convening authority who has the charges for disposition or, after

referral, the convening authority or the military judge may order that a

deposition be taken on request of a party.

### (c) Request to take deposition.

#### (1) Submission of request.

At any time after charges have been preferred, any party may request

in writing that a deposition be taken.

##### Discussion

A copy of the request and any accompanying papers ordinarily should

be served on the other parties when the request is submitted.

#### (2) Contents of request.

A request for a deposition shall include:

(A) The name and address of the person whose deposition is requested, or, if the name of the person is unknown, a description of the office or position of the person;

(B) A statement of the matters on which the person is to be examined; and

(C) Whether an oral or written deposition is requested.

#### (3) Action on request.

(A) Upon receipt of a request for a deposition, the convening authority or military judge shall determine whether the requesting party has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that due to exceptional circumstances and in the interest of justice, the testimony of the prospective witness must be taken and preserved for use at a preliminary hearing under Article 32 or court-martial.

##### (B) Written deposition.

A request for a written deposition may not be approved without the

consent of the opposing party except when the deposition is ordered solely

in lieu of producing a witness for sentencing under R.C.M. 1001 and the authority

ordering the deposition determines that the interests of the parties and the

court-martial can be adequately served by a written deposition.

###### Discussion

A request for an oral deposition may be approved without the consent

 of the opposing party.

##### (C) Notification of decision.

The authority who acts on the request shall promptly inform the

requesting party of the action on the request and, if the request is denied,

the reasons for denial.

##### (D) Waiver.

Failure to review before the military judge a request for a deposition

denied by a convening authority waives further consideration of the request.

### (d) Action when request is approved.

#### (1) Detail of deposition officer.

When a request for a deposition is approved, the convening authority shall detail a judge advocate certified under Art. 27(b) to serve as deposition officer. When the appointment of a judge advocate as deposition officer is not practicable, the convening authority may detail an impartial commissioned officer or appropriate civil officer authorized to administer oaths, not the accuser, to serve as deposition officer. If the deposition officer is not a judge advocate, an impartial judge advocate certified under Art. 27(b) shall be made available to provide legal advice to the deposition officer.

##### Discussion

_See_ Article 49(c).

  When a deposition

will be at a point distant from the command, an appropriate authority may

be requested to make available an officer to serve as deposition officer.

#### (2) Assignment of counsel.

If charges have not yet been referred to a court-martial when a

request to take a deposition is approved, the convening authority who directed

the taking of the deposition shall ensure that counsel qualified as required

under R.C.M. 502(d) are assigned to represent each party.

##### Discussion

The counsel who represents the accused at a deposition ordinarily

will form an attorney-client relationship with the accused which will continue

through a later court-martial. _ See_ R.C.M. 506.

  If

the accused has formed an attorney-client relationship with military counsel

concerning the charges in question, ordinarily that counsel should be appointed

to represent the accused.

#### (3) Instructions.

The convening authority may give instructions not inconsistent with

 this rule to the deposition officer.

##### Discussion

Such instruction may include the time and place for taking the deposition.

### (e) Notice.

The party at whose request a deposition is to be taken shall give

to every other party reasonable written notice of the time and place for

taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined.

On motion of a party upon whom the notice is served the deposition officer

may for cause shown extend or shorten the time or change the place for taking

the deposition, consistent with any instructions from the convening authority.

### (f) Duties of the deposition officer.

In accordance with this rule, and subject to any instructions under

subsection (d)(3) of this rule, the deposition officer shall:

(1) Arrange a time and place for taking the deposition and, in the case

of an oral deposition, notify the party who requested the deposition accordingly;

(2) Arrange for the presence of any witness whose deposition is to be

taken in accordance with the procedures for production of witnesses and evidence

under R.C.M. 703(e);

(3) Maintain order during the deposition and protect the parties and

witnesses from annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression;

(4) Administer the oath to each witness, the reporter, and interpreter,

if any;

(5) In the case of a written deposition, ask the questions submitted

by counsel to the witness;

(6) Cause the proceedings to be recorded so that a verbatim record is

made or may be prepared;

(7) Record, but not rule upon, objections or motions and the testimony

to which they relate;

(8) Authenticate the record of the deposition and forward it to the

authority who ordered the deposition; and

(9) Report to the convening authority any substantial irregularity in

the proceeding.

##### Discussion

When any unusual problem, such as improper conduct by counsel or

a witness, prevents an orderly and fair proceeding, the deposition officer

should adjourn the proceedings and inform the convening authority.

  The

authority who ordered the deposition should forward copies to the parties.

### (g) Procedure.

#### (1) Oral depositions.

##### (A) Rights of accused.

At an oral deposition, the accused shall have the rights to:

(i) Be present except when: _(a)_ the accused, absent

good cause shown, fails to appear after notice of time and place of the deposition; _

(b)_ the accused is disruptive within the meaning of R.C.M. 804(b)(2);

or _(c)_ the deposition is ordered in lieu of production of

a witness on sentencing under R.C.M. 1001 and the authority ordering the

deposition determines that the interests of the parties and the court-martial

can be served adequately by an oral deposition without the presence of the

accused; and

(ii) Be represented by counsel as provided in R.C.M. 506.

##### (B) Examination of witnesses.

Each witness giving an oral deposition shall be examined under oath.

The scope and manner of examination and cross-examination shall be such as

would be allowed in the trial itself. The Government shall make available

 to each accused for examination and use at the taking of the deposition any

statement of the witness which is in the possession of the United States

and to which the accused would be entitled at the trial.

###### Discussion

As to objections, _ see_ subsections (f)(7) and (h)

of this rule. As to production of prior statements of witnesses, _

see_ R.C.M. 914; Mil. R. Evid. 612, 613.

  A sample

oath for a deposition follows.

   "You (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you give

shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you

God)?"

#### (2) Written depositions.

##### (A) Rights of accused.

The accused shall have the right to be represented by counsel as

provided in R.C.M. 506 for the purpose of taking a written deposition, except

when the deposition is taken for use at a summary court-martial.

##### (B) Presence of parties.

No party has a right to be present at a written deposition.

##### (C) Submission of interrogatories to opponent.

The party requesting a written deposition shall submit to opposing

counsel a list of written questions to be asked of the witness. Opposing

counsel may examine the questions and shall be allowed a reasonable time

to prepare cross-interrogatories and objections, if any.

###### Discussion

The interrogatories and cross-interrogatories should be sent to

the deposition officer by the party who requested the deposition. _

See_ subsection (h)(3) of this rule concerning objections.

##### (D) Examination of witnesses.

The deposition officer shall swear the witness, read each question

presented by the parties to the witness, and record each response. The testimony

of the witness shall be recorded on videotape, audiotape, or similar material

or shall be transcribed. When the testimony is transcribed, the deposition

shall, except when impracticable, be submitted to the witness for examination.

The deposition officer may enter additional matters then stated by the witness

under oath. The deposition shall be signed by the witness if the witness

is available. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the deposition

officer shall record the reason. The certificate of authentication shall

then be executed.

#### (3) How recorded.

In the discretion of the authority who ordered the deposition, a

deposition may be recorded by a reporter or by other means including videotape,

audiotape, or sound film. In the discretion of the military judge, depositions

recorded by videotape, audiotape, or sound film may be played for the court-martial

or may be transcribed and read to the court-martial.

##### Discussion

A deposition read in evidence or one that is played during a court-martial,

is recorded and transcribed by the reporter in the same way as any other

testimony. The deposition need not be included in the record of trial.

### (h) Objections.

#### (1) In general.

A failure to object prior to the deposition to the taking of the

deposition on grounds which may be corrected if the objection is made prior

to the deposition waives such objection.

#### (2) Oral depositions.

Objections to questions, testimony, or evidence at an oral deposition

and the grounds for such objection shall be stated at the time of taking

such deposition. If an objection relates to a matter which could have been

 corrected if the objection had been made during the deposition, the objection

is waived if not made at the deposition.

##### Discussion

A party may show that an objection was made during the deposition

but not recorded, but, in the absence of such evidence, the transcript of

the deposition governs.

#### (3) Written depositions.

Objections to any question in written interrogatories shall be served

on the party who proposed the question before the interrogatories are sent

to the deposition officer or the objection is waived. Objections to answers

 in a written deposition may be made at trial.

### (i) Deposition by agreement not precluded.

#### (1) Taking deposition.

Nothing in this rule shall preclude the taking of a deposition without

cost to the United States, orally or upon written questions, by agreement

of the parties.

#### (2) Use of deposition.

Subject to Article 49, nothing in this rule shall preclude the use

of a deposition at the court-martial by agreement of the parties unless the

military judge forbids its use for good cause.

## Rule 703. Production of witnesses and evidence

### (a) In general.

The prosecution and defense and the court-martial shall have equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence, subject to the limitations set forth in R.C.M. 701(e)(1), including the benefit of compulsory process.

#### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 801(c) concerning the opportunity

of the court-martial to obtain witnesses and evidence.

### (b) Right to witnesses.

#### (1) On the merits or on interlocutory questions.

Each party is entitled to the production of any witness whose testimony

on a matter in issue on the merits or on an interlocutory question would

be relevant and necessary. With the consent of both the accused and Government, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify via remote means. Over a party's objection, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify on interlocutory questions via remote means or similar technology if the practical difficulties of producing the witness outweigh the significance of the witness' personal appearance (although such testimony will not be admissible over the accused's objection as evidence on the ultimate issue of guilt). Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to: the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the interlocutory proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; the likelihood of significant interference with military operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-court testimony.

##### Discussion

_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 401 concerning relevance.

  Relevant testimony is necessary when it is not cumulative and when it would contribute

to a party's presentation of the case in some positive way on a matter in

issue. A matter is not in issue when it is stipulated as a fact.

  The procedures for receiving testimony via remote means and the definition thereof are contained in R.C.M. 914B.  An issue may arise as both an interlocutory question and a question that bears on the ultimate issue of guilt.  See R.C.M. 801(e)(5).  In such circumstances, this rule authorizes the admission of testimony by remote means or similar technology over the accused's objection only as evidence on the interlocutory question.  In most instances, testimony taken over a party's objection will not be admissible as evidence on the question that bears on the ultimate issue of guilt; however, there may be certain limited circumstances where the testimony is admissible on the ultimate issue of guilt.  Such determinations must be made based upon the relevant rules of evidence.

#### (2) On sentencing.

Each party is entitled to the production of a witness whose testimony

on sentencing is required under R.C.M. 1001(e).

#### (3) Unavailable witness.

Notwithstanding subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this rule, a party

is not entitled to the presence of a witness who is unavailable within the

meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 804(a). However, if the testimony of a witness who

is unavailable is of such central importance to an issue that it is essential

to a fair trial, and if there is no adequate substitute for such testimony,

the military judge shall grant a continuance or other relief in order to

attempt to secure the witness' presence or shall abate the proceedings, unless

the unavailability of the witness is the fault of or could have been prevented

by the requesting party.

### (c) Determining which witness will be produced.

#### (1) Witnesses for the prosecution.

The trial counsel shall obtain the presence of witnesses whose testimony

the trial counsel considers relevant and necessary for the prosecution.

#### (2) Witnesses for the defense.

##### (A) Request.

The defense shall submit to the trial counsel a written list of

witnesses whose production by the Government the defense requests.

##### (B) Contents of request.

###### (i) Witnesses on merits or interlocutory questions.

A list of witnesses whose testimony the defense considers relevant

and necessary on the merits or on an interlocutory question shall include

the name, telephone number, if known, and address or location of the witness

 such that the witness can be found upon the exercise of due diligence and

a synopsis of the expected testimony sufficient to show its relevance and

necessity.

###### (ii) Witnesses on sentencing.

A list of witnesses wanted for presentencing proceedings shall include

the name, telephone number, if known, and address or location of the witness

such that the witness can be found upon the exercise of due diligence, a

synopsis of the testimony that it is expected the witness will give, and the

reasons why the witness' personal appearance will be necessary under the

standards set forth in R.C.M. 1001(e).

##### (C) Time of request.

A list of witnesses under this subsection shall be submitted in

time reasonably to allow production of each witness on the date when the

witness' presence will be necessary. The military judge may set a specific

date by which such lists must be submitted. Failure to submit the name of

a witness in a timely manner shall permit denial of a motion for production

of the witness, but relief from such denial may be granted for good cause

shown.

##### (D) Determination.

The trial counsel shall arrange for the presence of any witness

 listed by the defense unless the trial counsel contends that the witness'

 production is not required under this rule. If the trial counsel contends

that the witness' production is not required by this rule, the matter may

be submitted to the military judge. If the military judge grants a motion

for a witness, the trial counsel shall produce the witness or the proceedings

shall be abated.

###### Discussion

When significant or unusual costs would be involved in producing

 witnesses, the trial counsel should inform the convening authority, as the

 convening authority may elect to dispose of the matter by means other than

a court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(7). _See also

_ R.C.M. 905(j).

### (d) Employment of expert witnesses.

When the employment at Government expense of an expert is considered

 necessary by a party, the party shall, in advance of employment of the expert,

 and with notice to the opposing party, submit a request to the convening

authority to authorize the employment and to fix the compensation for the

expert. The request shall include a complete statement of reasons why employment

of the expert is necessary and the estimated cost of employment. A request

denied by the convening authority may be renewed before the military judge

who shall determine whether the testimony of the expert is relevant and necessary,

and, if so, whether the Government has provided or will provide an adequate

 substitute. If the military judge grants a motion for employment of an expert

or finds that the Government is required to provide a substitute, the proceedings

shall be abated if the Government fails to comply with the ruling. In the

absence of advance authorization, an expert witness may not be paid fees

other than those to which entitled under subsection (e)(2)(D) of this rule.

#### Discussion

_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 702, 706.

### (e) Procedures for production of witnesses.

#### (1) Military witnesses.

The attendance of a military witness may be obtained by notifying

the commander of the witness of the time, place, and date the witness' presence

is required and requesting the commander to issue any necessary orders to

the witness.

##### Discussion

When military witnesses are located near the court-martial, their

 presence can usually be obtained through informal coordination with them

and their commander. If the witness is not near the court-martial and attendance

would involve travel at government expense, or if informal coordination

is inadequate, the appropriate superior should be requested to issue the

necessary order.

  If practicable, a request for the attendance

of a military witness should be made so that the witness will have at least

48 hours notice before starting to travel to attend the court-martial.

  The

attendance of persons not on active duty should be obtained in the manner

prescribed in subsection (e)(2) of this rule.

#### (2) Civilian witnesses-subpoena.

##### (A) In general.

The presence of witnesses not on active duty may be obtained by

 subpoena.

###### Discussion

A subpoena is not necessary if the witness appears voluntarily at

no expense to the United States.

  Civilian employees of

the Department of Defense may be directed by appropriate authorities to appear

as witnesses in courts-martial as an incident of their employment. Appropriate

travel orders may be issued for this purpose.

  A subpoena

may not be used to compel a civilian to travel outside the United States

and its territories.

  A witness must be subject to United

States jurisdiction to be subject to a subpoena. Foreign nationals in a foreign

country are not subject to subpoena. Their presence may be obtained through

cooperation of the host nation.

##### (B) Contents.

A subpoena shall state the command by which the proceeding is directed, and the title, if any, of the proceeding. A subpoena shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony at the time and place specified therein. A subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information designated therein at the proceeding or at an earlier time for inspection by the parties. A subpoena issued for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 shall not command any person to attend or give testimony at an Article 32 preliminary hearing.

###### Discussion

A subpoena may not be used to compel a witness to appear at an examination or interview before trial, but a subpoena may be used to obtain witnesses for a deposition or a court of inquiry. In accordance with subsection (f)(4)(B) of this rule, a subpoena duces tecum to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information for pretrial investigation pursuant to Article 32 may be issued, following the convening authority's order directing such pretrial investigation, by either the investigating officer appointed under R.C.M. 405(d)(1) or the counsel representing the United States.

  A subpoena normally is prepared, signed, and issued in duplicate on the official forms. _See_ Appendix 7 for an example of a subpoena with certificate of service (DD Form 453) and a Travel Order (DD Form 453-1).

##### (C) Who may issue.

(1) A subpoena to secure evidence may be issued by:

(a) The summary court-martial;

(b) Detailed counsel for the government at an Article 32 preliminary hearing;

(c) After referral to a court-martial, detailed trial counsel;

(d) The president of a court of inquiry; or

(e) An officer detailed to take a deposition.

(2) A subpoena to secure witnesses may be issued by:

(a) the summary court-martial;

(b) after referral to a court-martial, detailed trial counsel;

(c) the president of a court of inquiry; or

(d) an officer detailed to take a deposition.

##### (D) Service.

A subpoena may be served by the person authorized by this rule to issue it, a United States Marshal, or any other person who is not less than 18 years of age. Service shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person named and by providing to the person named travel orders and a means for reimbursement for fees and mileage as may be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, or in the case of hardship resulting in the subpoenaed witness's inability to comply with the subpoena absent initial government payment, by providing to the person named travel orders, fees, and mileage sufficient to comply with the subpoena in rules prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

###### Discussion

If practicable, a subpoena should be issued in time to permit service at least 24 hours before the time the witness will have to travel to comply with the subpoena.

  _Informal service._ Unless formal service is advisable, the person who issued the subpoena may mail it to the witness in duplicate, enclosing a postage-paid envelope bearing a return address, with the request that the witness sign the acceptance of service on the copy and return it in the envelope provided. The return envelope should be addressed to the person who issued the subpoena. The person who issued the subpoena should include with it a statement to the effect that the rights of the witness to fees and mileage will not be impaired by voluntary compliance with the request and that a voucher for fees and mileage will be delivered to the witness promptly on being discharged from attendance.

  _Formal service._ Formal service is advisable whenever it is anticipated that the witness will not comply voluntarily with the subpoena. Appropriate fees and mileage must be paid or tendered. _See_ Article 47. If formal service is advisable, the person who issued the subpoena must assure timely and economical service. That person may do so by serving the subpoena personally when the witness is in the vicinity. When the witness is not in the vicinity, the subpoena may be sent in duplicate to the commander of a military installation near the witness. Such commanders should give prompt and effective assistance, issuing travel orders for their personnel to serve the subpoena when necessary.

  Service should ordinarily be made by a person subject to the code. The duplicate copy of the subpoena must have entered upon it proof of service as indicated on the form and must be promptly returned to the person who issued the subpoena. If service cannot be made, the person who issued the subpoena must be informed promptly. A stamped, addressed envelope should be provided for these purposes.

  For purposes of this Rule, _hardship_ is defined as any situation which would substantially preclude reasonable efforts to appear that could be solved by providing transportation or fees and mileage to which the witness is entitled for appearing at the hearing in question.

##### (E) Place of service.

###### (i) In general.

A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition,

 court-martial, or court of inquiry may be served at any place within the

United States, it Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions.

###### (ii) Foreign territory.

In foreign territory, the attendance of civilian witnesses may be

 obtained in accordance with existing agreements or, in the absence of agreements,

with principles of international law.

###### (iii) Occupied territory.

In occupied enemy territory, the appropriate commander may compel

the attendance of civilian witnesses located within the occupied territory.

##### (F) Relief.

If a person subpoenaed requests relief on grounds that compliance

is unreasonable or oppressive, the convening authority or, after referral,

the military judge may direct that the subpoena be modified or withdrawn

if appropriate.

##### (G) Neglect or refusal to appear.

###### (i) Issuance of warrant of attachment.

The military judge or, if there is no military judge, the convening

authority may, in accordance with this rule, issue a warrant of attachment

to compel the attendance of a witness or production of documents.

####### Discussion

A warrant of attachment (DD Form 454) may be used when necessary to compel a witness to appear or produce evidence under this rule. A warrant of attachment is a legal order addressed to an official directing that official to have the person named in the order brought before a court.

  Subpoenas issued under R.C.M. 703 are Federal process and a person not subject to the code may be prosecuted in a Federal civilian court under Article 47 for failure to comply with a subpoena issued in compliance with this rule and formally served.

  Failing to comply with such a subpoena is a felony offense, and may result in a fine or imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of the district court. The different purposes of the warrant of attachment and criminal complaint under Article 47 should be borne in mind. The warrant of attachment, available without the intervention of civilian judicial proceedings, has as its purpose the obtaining of the witness's presence, testimony, or documents. The criminal complaint, prosecuted through the civilian Federal courts, has as its purpose punishment for failing to comply with process issued by military authority. It serves to vindicate the military interest in obtaining compliance with its lawful process.

  For subpoenas issued for a pretrial investigation pursuant to Article 32 under subsection (f)(4)(B), the general court-martial convening authority with jurisdiction over the case may issue a warrant of attachment to compel production of documents.

###### (ii) Requirements.

A warrant of attachment may be issued only upon probable cause to believe that the witness was duly served with a subpoena, that the subpoena was issued in accordance with these rules, that a means of reimbursement of fees and mileage was provided to the witness or advanced to the witness in cases of hardship, that the witness is material, that the witness refused or willfully neglected to appear at the time and place specified on the subpoena, and that no valid excuse is reasonably apparent for the witness's failure to appear.

###### (iii) Form.

A warrant of attachment shall be written. All documents in support

of the warrant of attachment shall be attached to the warrant, together with

the charge sheet and convening orders.

###### (iv) Execution.

A warrant of attachment may be executed by a United States marshal

or such other person who is not less than 18 years of age as the authority

issuing the warrant may direct. Only such nondeadly force as may be necessary

to bring the witness before the court-martial or other proceeding may be used

to execute the warrant. A witness attached under this rule shall be brought

before the court-martial or proceeding without delay and shall testify as

soon as practicable and be released.

####### Discussion

In executing a warrant of attachment, no more force than necessary

to bring the witness to the court-martial, deposition, or court of inquiry

may be used.

###### (v) Definition.

For purposes of subsection (e)(2)(G) of this rule "military

judge" does not include a summary court-martial or the president of

a special court-martial without a military judge.

### (f) Right to evidence.

#### (1) In general.

Each party is entitled to the production of evidence which is relevant

and necessary.

##### Discussion

Relevance is defined by Mil. R. Evid. 401. Relevant evidence is necessary when it is not cumulative and when it would contribute to a party's presentation of the case in some positive way on a matter in issue. A matter is not in issue when it is stipulated as a fact. The discovery and introduction of classified or other government information is controlled by Mil. R. Evid. 505 and 506.

#### (2) Unavailable evidence.

Notwithstanding subsection (f)(1) of this rule, a party is not entitled

to the production of evidence which is destroyed, lost, or otherwise not

subject to compulsory process. However, if such evidence is of such central

importance to an issue that it is essential to a fair trial, and if there

is no adequate substitute for such evidence, the military judge shall grant

a continuance or other relief in order to attempt to produce the evidence

or shall abate the proceedings, unless the unavailability of the evidence

is the fault of or could have been prevented by the requesting party.

#### (3) Determining what evidence will be produced.

The procedures in subsection (c) of this rule shall apply to a determination

of what evidence will be produced, except that any defense request for the

production of evidence shall list the items of evidence to be produced and

shall include a description of each item sufficient to show its relevance

and necessity, a statement where it can be obtained, and, if known, the name,

address, and telephone number of the custodian of the evidence.

#### (4) Procedures for production of evidence.

##### (A) Evidence under the control of the Government.

Evidence under the control of the Government may be obtained by

notifying the custodian of the evidence of the time, place, and date the

evidence is required and requesting the custodian to send or deliver the evidence.

##### (B) Evidence not under the control of the government.

Evidence not under the control of the government may be obtained by a subpoena issued in accordance with subsection (e)(2) of this rule. A _subpoena duces tecum_ to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 may be issued, following the convening authority's order directing such preliminary hearing, by counsel for the government. A person in receipt of a _subpoena duces tecum_ for an Article 32 hearing need not personally appear in order to comply with the subpoena.

###### Discussion

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, &sect; 542, amended Article 47 to allow the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum for Article 32 hearings. Although the amended language cites Article 32(b), this new subpoena power extends to documents subpoenaed by the investigating officer and counsel representing the United States, whether or not requested by the defense.

##### (C) Relief.

If the person having custody of evidence requests relief on grounds

that compliance with the subpoena or order of production is unreasonable

or oppressive, the convening authority or, after referral, the military judge

may direct that the subpoena or order of production be withdrawn or modified.

Subject to Mil. R. Evid. 505 and 506, the military judge may direct that

the evidence be submitted to the military judge for an in camera inspection

in order to determine whether such relief should be granted.

## Rule 704. Immunity

### (a) Types of immunity.

Two types of immunity may be granted under this rule.

#### (1) Transactional immunity.

A person may be granted transactional immunity from trial by court-martial

for one or more offenses under the code.

#### (2) Testimonial immunity.

A person may be granted immunity from the use of testimony, statements,

and any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or

statements by that person in a later court-martial.

##### Discussion

"Testimonial" immunity is also called "use"

immunity.

  Immunity ordinarily should be granted only when

testimony or other information from the person is necessary to the public

interest, including the needs of good order and discipline, and when the person

 has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information

on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination.

  Testimonial

immunity is preferred because it does not bar prosecution of the person for

 the offenses about which testimony or information is given under the grant

of immunity.

  In any trial of a person granted testimonial

immunity after the testimony or information is given, the Government must

meet a heavy burden to show that it has not used in any way for the prosecution

of that person the person's statements, testimony, or information derived

from them. In many cases this burden makes difficult a later prosecution

of such a person for any offense that was the subject of that person's testimony

 or statements. Therefore, if it is intended to prosecute a person to whom

testimonial immunity has been or will be granted for offenses about which

that person may testify or make statements, it may be necessary to try that

person before the testimony or statements are given.

### (b) Scope.

Nothing in this rule bars:

(1) A later court-martial for perjury, false swearing, making a false

official statement, or failure to comply with an order to testify; or

(2) Use in a court-martial under subsection (b)(1) of this rule of testimony

or statements derived from such testimony or statements.

### (c) Authority to grant immunity.

Only a general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity,

and may do so only in accordance with this rule.

#### Discussion

Only general court-martial convening authorities are authorized

to grant immunity. However, in some circumstances, when a person testifies

or makes statements pursuant to a promise of immunity, or a similar promise,

by a person with apparent authority to make it, such testimony or statements

and evidence derived from them may be inadmissible in a later trial. Under

some circumstances a promise of immunity by someone other than a general

court-martial convening authority may bar prosecution altogether. Persons

not authorized to grant immunity should exercise care when dealing with accused

or suspects to avoid inadvertently causing statements to be inadmissible

or prosecution to be barred.

  A convening authority who grants

immunity to a prosecution witness in a court-martial may be disqualified

from taking post-trial action in the case under some circumstances.

#### (1) Persons subject to the code.

A general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity to

any person subject to the code. However, a general court-martial convening

authority may grant immunity to a person subject to the code extending to

a prosecution in a United States District Court only when specifically authorized

to do so by the Attorney General of the United States or other authority

designated under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 6004.

##### Discussion

When testimony or a statement for which a person subject to the

code may be granted immunity may relate to an offense for which that person

could be prosecuted in a United States District Court, immunity should not

be granted without prior coordination with the Department of Justice. Ordinarily

coordination with the local United States Attorney is appropriate. Unless

the Department of Justice indicates it has no interest in the case, authorization

for the grant of immunity should be sought from the Attorney General. A request

for such authorization should be forwarded through the office of the Judge

Advocate General concerned. Service regulations may provide additional guidance.

Even if the Department of Justice expresses no interest in the case, authorization

by the Attorney General for the grant of immunity may be necessary to compel

 the person to testify or make a statement if such testimony or statement

would make the person liable for a Federal civilian offense.

#### (2) Persons not subject to the code.

A general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity to

persons not subject to the code only when specifically authorized to do so

by the Attorney General of the United States or other authority designated

 under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 6004.

##### Discussion

_See_ the discussion under subsection (c)(1) of this

rule concerning forwarding a request for authorization to grant immunity

to the Attorney General.

#### (3) Other limitations.

The authority to grant immunity under this rule may not be delegated.

The authority to grant immunity may be limited by superior authority.

##### Discussion

Department of Defense Directive 1355.1 (21 July 1981) provides:

"A proposed grant of immunity in a case involving espionage, subversion,

aiding the enemy, sabotage, spying, or violation of rules or statutes concerning

 classified information or the foreign relations of the United States, shall

be forwarded to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense for the

purpose of consultation with the Department of Justice. The General Counsel

shall obtain the view of other appropriate elements of the Department of

defense in furtherance of such consultation."

### (d) Procedure.

A grant of immunity shall be written and signed by the convening

authority who issues it. The grant shall include a statement of the authority

under which it is made and shall identify the matters to which it extends.

#### Discussion

A person who has received a valid grant of immunity from a proper

authority may be ordered to testify. In addition, a servicemember who has

received a valid grant of immunity may be ordered to answer questions by

investigators or counsel pursuant to that grant. _See_ Mil.

R. Evid. 301(c). A person who refuses to testify despite a valid grant of

immunity may be prosecuted for such refusal. Persons subject to the code

may be charged under Article 134. _See_ paragraph 108, Part

IV. A grant of immunity removes the right to refuse to testify or make a

statement on self-incrimination grounds. It does not, however, remove other

 privileges against disclosure of information. _See_ Mil. R.

Evid., Section V.

  An immunity order or grant must not specify

the contents of the testimony it is expected the witness will give.

  When

immunity is granted to a prosecution witness, the accused must be notified

in accordance with Mil. R. Evid. 301(c)(2).

### (e) Decision to grant immunity.

Unless limited by superior competent authority, the decision to

grant immunity is a matter within the sole discretion of the appropriate

general court-martial convening authority. However, if a defense request

to immunize a witness has been denied, the military judge may, upon motion

by the defense, grant appropriate relief directing that either an appropriate

convening authority grant testimonial immunity to a defense witness or, as

to the affected charges and specifications, the proceedings against the accused

be abated, upon findings that:

(1) The witness intends to invoke the right against self-incrimination

to the extent permitted by law if called to testify; and

(2) The Government has engaged in discriminatory use of immunity to

obtain a tactical advantage, or the Government, through its own overreaching,

has forced the witness to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination;

and

(3) The witness' testimony is material, clearly exculpatory, not cumulative,

not obtainable from any other source and does more than merely affect the

credibility of other witnesses.

## Rule 705. Pretrial agreements

### (a) In general.

Subject to such limitations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe,

 an accused and the convening authority may enter into a pretrial agreement

in accordance with this rule.

#### Discussion

The authority of convening authorities to refer cases to trial and

 approve pretrial agreements extends only to trials by courts-martial. To

ensure that such actions do not preclude appropriate action by Federal civilian

authorities in cases likely to be prosecuted in the United States District

Courts, convening authorities shall ensure that appropriate consultation

under the "Memorandum of Understanding Between the Departments of

Justice and Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of Crimes

Over Which the Two Departments Have Concurrent Jurisdiction " has taken

place prior to trial by court-martial or approval of a pretrial agreement

in cases where such consultation is required. _ See_ Appendix

3.

### (b) Nature of agreement.

A pretrial agreement may include:

(1) A promise by the accused to plead guilty to, or to enter a confessional

stipulation as to one or more charges and specifications, and to fulfill

such additional terms or conditions which may be included in the agreement

and which are not prohibited under this rule; and

(2) A promise by the convening authority to do one or more of the following:

(A) Refer the charges to a certain type of court-martial;

(B) Refer a capital offense as noncapital;

(C) Withdraw one or more charges or specifications from the court-martial;

###### Discussion

A convening authority may withdraw certain specifications and/or

 charges from a court-martial and dismiss them if the accused fulfills the

accused's promises in the agreement. Except when jeopardy has attached

(_see_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)), such withdrawal and dismissal

does not bar later reinstitution of the charges by the same or a different

convening authority. A judicial determination that the accused breached

the pretrial agreement is not required prior to reinstitution of withdrawn

or dismissed specifications and/or charges.  If the defense moves to dismiss

the reinstituted specifications and/or charges on the grounds that the government

 remains bound by the terms of the pretrial agreement, the government will

be required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the accused

has breached the terms of the pretrial agreement. If the agreement is intended

 to grant immunity to an accused, _see_ R.C.M. 704.

(D) Have the trial counsel present no evidence as to one or more specifications

or portions thereof; and

(E) Take specified action on the sentence adjudged by the court-martial.

###### Discussion

For example, the convening authority may agree to approve no sentence

 in excess of a specified maximum, to suspend all or part of a sentence,

to defer confinement, or to mitigate certain forms of punishment into less

severe forms.

### (c) Terms and conditions.

#### (1) Prohibited terms or conditions.

##### (A) Not voluntary.

A term or condition in a pretrial agreement shall not be enforced

if the accused did not freely and voluntarily agree to it.

##### (B) Deprivation of certain rights.

A term or condition in a pretrial agreement shall not be enforced

if it deprives the accused of: the right to counsel; the right to due process;

the right to challenge the jurisdiction of the court-martial; the right

to a speedy trial; the right to complete sentencing proceedings; the complete

and effective exercise of post-trial and appellate rights.

###### Discussion

A pretrial agreement provision which prohibits the accused from

 making certain pretrial motions (_see_ R.C.M. 905-907)

may be improper.

#### (2) Permissible terms or conditions.

Subject to subsection (c)(1)(A) of this rule, subsection (c)(1)(B)

of this rule does not prohibit either party from proposing the following

additional conditions:

(A) A promise to enter into a stipulation of fact concerning offenses

to which a plea of guilty or as to which a confessional stipulation will

be entered;

(B) A promise to testify as a witness in the trial of another person;

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 704(a)(2) concerning testimonial immunity.

Only a general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity.

(C) A promise to provide restitution;

(D) A promise to conform the accused's conduct to certain conditions

of probation before action by the convening authority as well as during

any period of suspension of the sentence, provided that the requirements

 of R.C.M. 1109 must be complied with before an alleged violation of such

terms may relieve the convening authority of the obligation to fulfill the

agreement; and

(E) A promise to waive procedural requirements such as the Article 32 preliminary hearing, the right to trial by court-martial composed of members or

the right to request trial by military judge alone, or the opportunity to

obtain the personal appearance of witnesses at sentencing proceedings.

### (d) Procedure.

#### (1) Negotiation.

Pretrial agreement negotiations may be initiated by the accused,

 defense counsel, trial counsel, the staff judge advocate, convening authority,

or their duly authorized representatives. Either the defense or the government

may propose any term or condition not prohibited by law or public policy.

Government representatives shall negotiate with defense counsel unless the

accused has waived the right to counsel.

#### (2) Formal submission.

After negotiation, if any, under subsection (d)(1) of this rule,

if the accused elects to propose a pretrial agreement, the defense shall

submit a written offer. All terms, conditions, and promises between the

parties shall be written. The proposed agreement shall be signed by the accused

and defense counsel, if any. If the agreement contains any specified action

on the adjudged sentence, such action shall be set forth on a page separate

from the other portions of the agreement.

##### Discussion

The first part of the agreement ordinarily contains an offer to

plead guilty and a description of the offenses to which the offer extends.

It must also contain a complete and accurate statement of any other agreed

terms or conditions. For example, if the convening authority agrees to withdraw

certain specifications, or if the accused agrees to waive the right to an

Article 32 preliminary hearing, this should be stated. The written agreement should

contain a statement by the accused that the accused enters it freely and

voluntarily and may contain a statement that the accused has been advised

of certain rights in connection with the agreement.

#### (3) Acceptance.

The convening authority may either accept or reject an offer of

the accused to enter into a pretrial agreement or may propose by counteroffer

any terms or conditions not prohibited by law or public policy. The decision

whether to accept or reject an offer is within the sole discretion of the

convening authority. When the convening authority has accepted a pretrial

agreement, the agreement shall be signed by the convening authority or by

a person, such as the staff judge advocate or trial counsel, who has been

authorized by the convening authority to sign.

##### Discussion

The convening authority should consult with the staff judge advocate

 or trial counsel before acting on an offer to enter into a pretrial agreement.

#### (4) Withdrawal.

##### (A) By accused.

The accused may withdraw from a pretrial agreement at any time;

 however, the accused may withdraw a plea of guilty or a confessional stipulation

entered pursuant to a pretrial agreement only as provided in R.C.M. 910(h)

or 811(d), respectively.

##### (B) By convening authority.

The convening authority may withdraw from a pretrial agreement at

any time before the accused begins performance of promises contained in the

agreement, upon the failure by the accused to fulfill any material promise

or condition in the agreement, when inquiry by the military judge discloses

a disagreement as to a material term in the agreement, or if findings are

set aside because a plea of guilty entered pursuant to the agreement is held

improvident on appellate review.

### (e) Nondisclosure of existence of agreement.

Except in a special court-martial without a military judge, no member

of a court-martial shall be informed of the existence of a pretrial agreement.

In addition, except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 410, the fact that an accused

offered to enter into a pretrial agreement, and any statements made by an

accused in connection therewith, whether during negotiations or during a

providence inquiry, shall not be otherwise disclosed to the members.

#### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 910(f) (plea agreement inquiry).

## Rule 706. Inquiry into the mental capacity or mental responsibility of the accused

### (a) Initial action.

If it appears to any commander who considers the disposition of

charges, or to any preliminary hearing officer, trial counsel, defense counsel,

military judge, or member that there is reason to believe that the accused

lacked mental responsibility for any offense charged or lacks capacity to

stand trial, that fact and the basis of the belief or observation shall be

transmitted through appropriate channels to the officer authorized to order

an inquiry into the mental condition of the accused. The submission may be

accompanied by an application for a mental examination under this rule.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 909 concerning the capacity of the accused

to stand trial and R.C.M. 916(k) concerning mental responsibility of the

accused.

### (b) Ordering an inquiry.

#### (1) Before referral.

Before referral of charges, an inquiry into the mental capacity

or mental responsibility of the accused may be ordered by the convening authority

before whom the charges are pending for disposition.

#### (2) After referral.

After referral of charges, an inquiry into the mental capacity or

mental responsibility of the accused may be ordered by the military judge.

The convening authority may order such an inquiry after referral of charges

but before beginning of the first session of the court-martial (including

any Article 39(a) session) when the military judge is not reasonably available.

The military judge may order a mental examination of the accused regardless

of any earlier determination by the convening authority.

### (c) Inquiry.

#### (1) By whom conducted.

When a mental examination is ordered under subsection (b) of this

rule, the matter shall be referred to a board consisting of one or more persons.

Each member of the board shall be either a physician or a clinical psychologist.

Normally, at least one member of the board shall be either a psychiatrist

or a clinical psychologist. The board shall report as to the mental capacity

or mental responsibility or both of the accused.

#### (2) Matters in inquiry.

When a mental examination is ordered under this rule, the order

shall contain the reasons for doubting the mental capacity or mental responsibility,

or both, of the accused, or other reasons for requesting the examination.

In addition to other requirements, the order shall require the board to make

separate and distinct findings as to each of the following questions:

(A) At the time of the alleged criminal conduct, did the accused have

a severe mental disease or defect? (The term "severe mental disease

or defect" does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated

 criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct, or minor disorders such as nonpsychotic

behavior disorders and personality defects.)

(B) What is the clinical psychiatric diagnosis?

(C) Was the accused, at the time of the alleged criminal conduct and

as a result of such severe mental disease or defect, unable to appreciate

the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his or her conduct?

(D) Is the accused presently suffering from a mental disease or defect

rendering the accused unable to understand the nature of the proceedings

against the accused or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense?



Other

appropriate questions may also be included.

#### (3) Directions to board.

In addition to the requirements specified in subsection (c)(2) of

 this rule, the order to the board shall specify:

(A) That upon completion of the board's investigation, a statement

consisting only of the board's ultimate conclusions as to all questions specified

in the order shall be submitted to the officer ordering the examination,

 the accused's commanding officer, the preliminary hearing officer, if any, appointed

 pursuant to Article 32 and to all counsel in the case, the convening authority,

and, after referral, to the military judge;

(B) That the full report of the board may be released by the board or

 other medical personnel only to other medical personnel for medical purposes,

unless otherwise authorized by the convening authority or, after referral

 of charges, by the military judge, except that a copy of the full report

shall be furnished to the defense and, upon request, to the commanding officer

of the accused; and

(C) That neither the contents of the full report nor any matter considered

by the board during its investigation shall be released by the board or other

medical personnel to any person not authorized to receive the full report,

 except pursuant to an order by the military judge.

###### Discussion

Based on the report, further action in the case may be suspended,

the charges may be dismissed by the convening authority, administrative

action may be taken to discharge the accused from the service or, subject

to Mil. R. Evid. 302, the charges may be tried by court-martial.

#### (4) Additional examinations.

Additional examinations may be directed under this rule at any stage

 of the proceedings as circumstances may require.

#### (5) Disclosure to trial counsel.

No person, other than the defense counsel, accused, or, after referral

of charges, the military judge may disclose to the trial counsel any statement

made by the accused to the board or any evidence derived from such statement.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 302.

## Rule 707. Speedy trial

### (a) In general.

The accused shall be brought to trial within 120 days after the

 earlier of:

(1) Preferral of charges;

##### Discussion

Delay from the time of an offense to preferral of charges or the

 imposition of pretrial restraint is not considered for speedy trial purposes. _

See also_ Article 43 (statute of limitations). In some circumstances

such delay may prejudice the accused and may result in dismissal of the

charges or other relief. Offenses ordinarily should be disposed of promptly

to serve the interests of good order and discipline. Priority shall be given

to persons in arrest or confinement.

(2) The imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4); or

(3) Entry on active duty under R.C.M. 204.

### (b) Accountability.

#### (1) In general.

The date of preferral of charges, the date on which pretrial restraint

under R.C.M. 304 (a)(2)-(4) is imposed, or the date of entry on active duty

under R.C.M. 204 shall not count for purpose of computing time under subsection

(a) of this rule. The date on which the accused is brought to trial shall

count. The accused is brought to trial within the meaning of this rule at

the time of arraignment under R.C.M. 904.

#### (2) Multiple Charges.

When charges are preferred at different times, accountability for

 each charge shall be determined from the appropriate date under subsection

(a) of this rule for that charge.

#### (3) Events which affect time periods.

##### (A) Dismissal or mistrial.

If charges are dismissed, or if a mistrial is granted, a new 120-day

 time period under this rule shall begin on the date of dismissal or mistrial

for cases in which there is no repreferral and cases in which the accused

is in pretrial restraint. In all other cases, a new 120-day time period under

the rule shall begin on the earlier of

(i) the date of repreferral; or

(ii) the date of imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4).

##### (B) Release from restraint.

If the accused is released from pretrial restraint for a significant

 period, the 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the earlier

of

(i) the date of preferral of charges;

(ii) the date on which restraint under R.C.M. 304(a) (2)-(4) is reimposed;

 or

(iii) the date of entry on active duty under R.C.M. 204.

##### (C) Government appeals.

If notice of appeal under R.C.M. 908 is filed, a new 120-day time

 period under this rule shall begin, for all charges neither proceeded on

nor severed under R.C.M. 908(b)(4), on the date of notice to the parties

 under R.C.M. 908(b)(8) or 908(c)(3), unless it is determined that the appeal

 was filed solely for the purpose of delay with the knowledge that it was

totally frivolous and without merit. After the decision of the Court of

Criminal Appeals under R.C.M. 908, if there is a further appeal to the Court

of Appeals for the Armed Forces or, subsequently, to the Supreme Court, a

new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date the parties

are notified of the final decision of the Court of Appeals for the Armed

Forces, or, if appropriate, the Supreme Court.

##### (D) Rehearings.

If a rehearing is ordered or authorized by an appellate court, a

new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date that the responsible

convening authority receives the record of trial and the opinion authorizing

or directing a rehearing. An accused is brought to trial within the meaning

of this rule at the time of arraignment under R.C.M. 904 or, if arraignment

is not required (such as in the case of a sentence-only rehearing), at the

time of the first session under R.C.M. 803.

##### (E) Commitment of the incompetent accused.

If the accused is committed to the custody of the Attorney General

 for hospitalization as provided in R.C.M. 909(f), all periods of such commitment

shall be excluded when determining whether the period in subsection (a)

of this rule has run. If, at the end of the period of commitment, the accused

is returned to the custody of the general court-martial convening authority,

a new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date of such

return to custody.

### (c) Excludable delay.

All periods of time during which appellate courts have issued stays

in the proceedings, or the accused is absent without authority, or the accused

is hospitalized due to incompetence, or is otherwise in the custody of the

Attorney General, shall be excluded when determining whether the period in

subsection (a) of this rule has run. All other pretrial delays approved by

a military judge or the convening authority shall be similarly excluded.

#### (1) Procedure.

Prior to referral, all requests for pretrial delay, together with

 supporting reasons, will be submitted to the convening authority or, if

authorized under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, to a

military judge for resolution. After referral, such requests for pretrial

 delay will be submitted to the military judge for resolution.

##### Discussion

The decision to grant or deny a reasonable delay is a matter within

 the sole discretion of the convening authority or a military judge. This

decision should be based on the facts and circumstances then and there existing.

Reasons to grant a delay might, for example, include the need for: time to

enable counsel to prepare for trial in complex cases; time to allow examination

into the mental capacity of the accused; time to process a member of the

reserve component to active duty for disciplinary action; time to complete

 other proceedings related to the case; time requested by the defense; time

to secure the availability of the accused, substantial witnesses, or other

evidence; time to obtain appropriate security clearances for access to classified

information or time to declassify evidence; or additional time for other

good cause.

  Pretrial delays should not be granted ex parte,

and when practicable, the decision granting the delay, together with supporting

reasons and the dates covering the delay, should be reduced to writing.

  Prior

to referral, the convening authority may delegate the authority to grant

continuances to an Article 32 preliminary hearing officer.

#### (2) Motions.

Upon accused's timely motion to a military judge under R.C.M. 905

for speedy trial relief, counsel should provide the court a chronology detailing

the processing of the case. This chronology should be made a part of the

appellate record.

### (d) Remedy.

A failure to comply with this rule will result in dismissal of the

affected charges, or, in a sentence-only rehearing, sentence relief as appropriate.

#### (1) Dismissal.

Dismissal will be with or without prejudice to the government's

right to reinstitute court-martial proceedings against the accused for the

same offense at a later date. The charges must be dismissed with prejudice

where the accused has been deprived of his or her constitutional right to

a speedy trial. In determining whether to dismiss charges with or without

prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors:

 the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case that

lead to dismissal; the impact of a re-prosecution on the administration of

justice; and any prejudice to the accused resulting from the denial of a speedy

trial.

#### (2) Sentence relief.

In determining whether or how much sentence relief is appropriate,

the military judge shall consider, among others, each of the following factors:

the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused's demand for

speedy trial, and any prejudice to the accused from the delay. Any sentence

relief granted will be applied against the sentence approved by the convening

authority.

##### Discussion

_See_ subsection (c)(1) and the accompanying Discussion

concerning reasons for delay and procedures for parties to request delay.

### (e) Waiver.

Except as provided in R.C.M. 910(a)(2), a plea of guilty which

results in a finding of guilty waives any speedy trial issue as to that offense.

#### Discussion

Speedy trial issues may also be waived by a failure to raise the

 issue at trial. _See_ R.C.M. 905(e) and 907(b)(2).

# CHAPTER VIII. TRIAL PROCEDURE GENERALLY

## Rule 801. Military judge's responsibilities; other matters

### (a) Responsibilities of military judge.

The military judge is the presiding officer in a court-martial.

#### Discussion

The military judge is responsible for ensuring that court-martial

proceedings are conducted in a fair and orderly manner, without unnecessary

delay or waste of time or resources. Unless otherwise specified, the president

of a special court-martial without a military judge has the same authority

and responsibility as a military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 502(b)(2).

The military judge shall:

(1) Determine the time and uniform for each session of a court-martial;

##### Discussion

The military judge should consult with counsel concerning the scheduling

of sessions and the uniform to be worn. The military judge recesses or adjourns

the court-martial as appropriate. Subject to R.C.M. 504(d)(1), the military

judge may also determine the place of trial. _See also_ R.C.M.

906(b)(11).

(2) Ensure that the dignity and decorum of the proceedings are maintained;

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 804 and 806. Courts-martial should

be conducted in an atmosphere which is conducive to calm and detached deliberation

and determination of the issues presented and which reflects the seriousness

of the proceedings.

(3) Subject to the code and this Manual, exercise reasonable control

over the proceedings to promote the purposes of these rules and this Manual;

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 102. The military judge may, within

the framework established by the code and this Manual, prescribe the manner

and order in which the proceedings may take place. Thus, the military judge

 may determine: when, and in what order, motions will be

 litigated (_see_ R.C.M. 905); the manner in which voir dire will be conducted

and challenges made (_see_ R.C.M. 902(d) and 912); the order

 in which witnesses may testify (_see_ R.C.M. 913; Mil. R.

Evid. 611); the order in which the parties may argue on a motion or objection;

and the time limits for argument (_see_ R.C.M. 905; 919; 1001(g)).

  The

military judge should prevent unnecessary waste of time and promote the ascertainment

 of truth, but must avoid undue interference with the parties' presentations

or the appearance of partiality. The parties are entitled to a reasonable

opportunity to properly present and support their contentions on any relevant

matter.

(4) Subject to subsection (e) of this rule, rule on all interlocutory

questions and all questions of law raised during the court-martial; and

(5) Instruct the members on questions of law and procedure which may

arise.

##### Discussion

The military judge instructs the members concerning findings

(_see_ R.C.M. 920) and sentence (_see_ R.C.M. 1005),

and when otherwise appropriate. For example, preliminary instructions to

the members concerning their duties and the duties of other trial participants

and other matters are normally appropriate. _See_ R.C.M. 913.

Other instructions (for example, instructions on the limited purpose for

which evidence has been introduced, _see_ Mil. R. Evid. 105)

may be given whenever the need arises.

(6) In the case of a victim of an offense under the UCMJ who is under 18 years of age and not a member of the armed forces, or who is incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, designate in writing a family member, a representative of the estate of the victim, or another suitable individual to assume the victim's rights under the UCMJ.

(A) For the purposes of this rule, the individual is designated for the sole purpose of assuming the legal rights of the victim as they pertain to the victim's status as a victim of any offense(s) properly before the court.

##### Discussion

 The rights that a designee may exercise on behalf of a victim include the right to receive notice of public hearings in the case; the right to be reasonably heard at such hearings, if permitted by law; and the right to confer with counsel representing the government at such hearings. The designee may also be the custodial guardian of the child.

 When determining whom to appoint under this rule, the military judge may consider the following: the age and maturity, relationship to the victim, and physical proximity of any proposed designee; the costs incurred in effecting the appointment; the willingness of the proposed designee to serve in such a role; the previous appointment of a guardian by another court of competent jurisdiction; the preference of the victim; any potential delay in any proceeding that may be caused by a specific appointment; and any other relevant information.

(B) Procedure to determine appointment of designee.

(i) As soon as practicable, trial counsel shall notify the military judge, counsel for the accused and the victim(s) of any offense(s) properly before the court when there is an apparent requirement to appoint a designee under this rule.

###### Discussion

 In the event a case involves multiple victims who are entitled to notice under this rule, each victim is only entitled to notice relating to his or her own designated representative.

(ii) The military judge will determine if the appointment of a designee is required under this rule.

(iii) At the discretion of the military judge, victim(s), trial counsel, and the accused may be given the opportunity to recommend to the military judge individual(s) for appointment.

(iv) The military judge is not required to hold a hearing before determining whether a designation is required or making such an appointment under this rule.

(v) If the military judge determines a hearing pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ, is necessary, the following shall be notified of the hearing and afforded the right to be present at the hearing: trial counsel, accused, and the victim(s).

(vi) The individual designated shall not be the accused.

(C) At any time after appointment, a designee shall be excused upon request by the designee or a finding of good cause by the military judge.

(D) If the individual appointed to assume the victim's rights is excused, the military judge shall appoint a successor consistent with this rule.

###### Discussion

 The term "victim of an offense under the UCMJ" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ. "Good Cause" means adequate or reasonable grounds to believe that the individual appointed to assume the victim's rights is not acting or does not intend to act in the best interest of the victim.

### (b) Rules of court; contempt.

The military judge may:

(1) Subject to R.C.M. 108, promulgate and enforce rules of court.

(2) Subject to R.C.M. 809, exercise contempt power.

### (c) Obtaining evidence.

The court-martial may act to obtain evidence in addition to that

 presented by the parties. The right of the members to have additional evidence

obtained is subject to an interlocutory ruling by the military judge.

#### Discussion

The members may request and the military judge may require that

a witness be recalled, or that a new witness be summoned, or other evidence

produced. The members or military judge may direct trial counsel to make

an inquiry along certain lines to discover and produce additional evidence. _

See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 614. In taking such action, the court-martial

must not depart from an impartial role.

### (d) Uncharged offenses.

If during the trial there is evidence that the accused may be guilty

of an untried offense not alleged in any specification before the court-martial,

the court-martial shall proceed with the trial of the offense charged.

#### Discussion

A report of the matter may be made to the convening authority after

trial. If charges are preferred for an offense indicated by the evidence

referred to in this subsection, no member of the court-martial who participated

in the first trial should sit in any later trial. Such a member would ordinarily

be subject to a challenge for cause. _See_ R.C.M. 912. _

See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 105 concerning instructing the members on

evidence of uncharged misconduct.

### (e) Interlocutory questions and questions of law.

For purposes of this subsection "military judge" does

not include the president of a special court-martial without a military

judge.

#### (1) Rulings by the military judge.

##### (A) Finality of rulings.

Any ruling by the military judge upon a question of law, including

a motion for a finding of not guilty, or upon any interlocutory question

is final.

##### (B) Changing a ruling.

The military judge may change a ruling made by that or another

military judge in the case except a previously granted motion for a finding

of not guilty, at any time during the trial.

##### (C) Article 39(a) sessions.

When required by this Manual or otherwise deemed appropriate by

the military judge, interlocutory questions or questions of law shall be

presented and decided at sessions held without members under R.C.M. 803.

###### Discussion

Sessions without members are appropriate for interlocutory questions,

 questions of law, and instructions. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid.

103; 304; 311; 321. Such sessions should be used to the extent possible

consistent with the orderly, expeditious progress of the proceedings.

#### (2) Ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a military

 judge.

##### (A) Questions of law.

Any ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a

 military judge on any question of law other than a motion for a finding

of not guilty is final.

##### (B) Questions of fact.

Any ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a

 military judge on any interlocutory question of fact, including a factual

issue of mental capacity of the accused, or on a motion for a finding of

not guilty, is final unless objected to by a member.

##### (C) Changing a ruling.

The president of a special court-martial without a military judge

may change a ruling made by that or another president in the case except

a previously granted motion for a finding of not guilty, at any time during

 the trial.

##### (D) Presence of members.

Except as provided in R.C.M. 505 and 912, all members will be present

 at all sessions of a special court-martial without a military judge, including

sessions at which questions of law or interlocutory questions are litigated.

However, the president of a special court-martial without a military judge

may examine an offered item of real or documentary evidence before ruling

on its admissibility without exposing it to other members.

#### (3) Procedures for rulings by the president of a special court-martial

 without a military judge which are subject to objection by a member.

##### (A) Determination.

The president of a special court-martial without a military judge

 shall determine whether a ruling is subject to objection.

##### (B) Instructions.

When a ruling by the president of a special court-martial without

a military judge is subject to objection, the president shall so advise

the members and shall give such instructions on the issue as may be necessary

to enable the members to understand the issue and the legal standards by

which they will determine it if objection is made.

##### (C) Voting.

When a member objects to a ruling by the president of a special

court-martial without a military judge which is subject to objection, the

court-martial shall be closed, and the members shall vote orally, beginning

 with the junior in rank, and the question shall be decided by a majority

vote. A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty is a determination

against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination

in favor of the accused.

##### (D) Consultation.

The president of a special court-martial without a military judge

may close the court-martial and consult with other members before ruling

on a matter, when such ruling is subject to the objection of any member.

#### (4) Standard of proof.

Questions of fact in an interlocutory question shall be determined

by a preponderance of the evidence, unless otherwise stated in this Manual.

In the absence of a rule in this Manual assigning the burden of persuasion,

 the party making the motion or raising the objection shall bear the burden

of persuasion.

##### Discussion

A ruling on an interlocutory question should be preceded by any

necessary inquiry into the pertinent facts and law. For example, the party

making the objection, motion, or request may be required to furnish evidence

or legal authority in support of the contention. An interlocutory issue may

have a different standard of proof. _See_, for example, Mil.

R. Evid. 314(e)(5), which requires consent for a search to be proved by clear

and convincing evidence.

  Most of the common motions are

discussed in specific rules in this Manual, and the burden of persuasion

is assigned therein. The prosecution usually bears the burden of persuasion

(_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 304(e); 311(e); _see also_ R.C.M.

905 through 907) once an issue has been raised. What "raises"

an issue may vary with the issue. Some issues may be raised by a timely motion

or objection. _See_, for example, Mil. R. Evid. 304(e). Others

may not be raised until the defense has made an offer of proof or presented

evidence in support of its position. _See_, for example, Mil.

R. Evid. 311(g)(2). The rules in this Manual and relevant decisions should

be consulted when a question arises as to whether an issue is raised, as

well as which side has the burden of persuasion. The military judge or president

of a special court-martial may require a party to clarify a motion or objection

or to make an offer of proof, regardless of the burden of persuasion, when

it appears that the motion or objection is vague, inapposite, irrelevant,

or spurious.

#### (5) Scope.

Subsection (e) of this rule applies to the disposition of questions

of law and interlocutory questions arising during trial except the question

whether a challenge should be sustained.

##### Discussion

Questions of law and interlocutory questions include all issues

which arise during trial other than the findings (that is, guilty or not

guilty), sentence, and administrative matters such as declaring recesses and

 adjournments. A question may be both interlocutory and a question of law.

Challenges are specifically covered in R.C.M. 902 and 912.

  Questions

of the applicability of a rule of law to an undisputed set of facts are normally

 questions of law. Similarly, the legality of an act is normally a question

of law. For example, the legality of an order when disobedience of an order

is charged, the legality of restraint when there is a prosecution for breach

of arrest, or the sufficiency of warnings before interrogation are normally

questions of law. It is possible, however, for such questions to be decided

solely upon some factual issue, in which case they would be questions of

fact. For example, the question of what warnings, if any, were given by an

interrogator to a suspect would be a factual question.

  A

question is interlocutory unless the ruling on it would finally decide whether

the accused is guilty. Questions which may determine the ultimate issue of

guilt are not interlocutory. An issue may arise as both an interlocutory

question and a question which may determine the ultimate issue of guilt. An

 issued is not purely interlocutory if an accused raises a defense or objection

and the disputed facts involved determine the ultimate question of guilt.

For example, if during a trial for desertion the accused moves to dismiss

for lack of jurisdiction and presents some evidence that the accused is not

a member of an armed force, the accused's status as a military person may

determine the ultimate question of guilt because status is an element of

the offense. If the motion is denied, the disputed facts must be resolved

by each member in deliberation upon the findings. (The accused's status as

a servicemember would have to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence

to uphold jurisdiction, _ see_ R.C.M. 907, but beyond a reasonable

doubt to permit a finding of guilty.) If, on the other hand, the accused

was charged with larceny and presented the same evidence as to military status,

the evidence would bear only upon amenability to trial and the issue would

be disposed of solely as an interlocutory question.

  Interlocutory

questions may be questions of fact or questions of law. This distinction is

important because the president of a special court-martial without a military

judge rules finally on interlocutory questions of law, but not on interlocutory

questions of fact. On interlocutory questions of fact the president of a

special court-martial without a military judge rules subject to the objection

of any other member. On mixed questions of fact and law, rulings by the president

are subject to objection by any member to the extent that the issue of fact

can be isolated and considered separately.

### (f) Rulings on record.

All sessions involving rulings or instructions made or given by

the military judge or the president of a special court-martial without a

military judge shall be made a part of the record. All rulings and instructions

shall be made or given in open session in the presence of the parties and

the members, except as otherwise may be determined in the discretion of the

military judge. For purposes of this subsection [R.C.M. 801(f)]

"military judge" does not include the president of a special

court-martial without a military judge.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 808 and 1103 concerning preparation

of the record of trial.

### (g) Effect of failure to raise defenses or objections.

Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests

or motions which must be made at the time set by this Manual or by the military

judge under authority of this Manual, or prior to any extension thereof made

by the military judge, shall constitute waiver thereof, but the military judge

for good cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.

## Rule 802. Conferences

### (a) In general.

After referral, the military judge may, upon request of any party

or _sua sponte_, order one or more conferences with the parties

to consider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial.

#### Discussion

Conferences between the military judge and counsel may be held when

necessary before or during trial. The purpose of such conference is to inform

the military judge of anticipated issues and to expeditiously resolve matters

on which the parties can agree, not to litigate or decide contested issues. _

See_ subsection (c) below. No party may be compelled to resolve any

matter at a conference.

  A conference may be appropriate

in order to resolve scheduling difficulties, so that witnesses and members

are not unnecessarily inconvenienced. Matters which will ultimately be in

the military judge's discretion, such as conduct of voir dire, seating arrangements

in the courtroom, or procedures when there are multiple accused may be resolved

at a conference. Conferences may be used to advise the military judge of issues

 or problems, such as unusual motions or objections, which are likely to arise

during trial.

  Occasionally it may be appropriate to resolve

certain issues, in addition to routine or administrative matters, if this

can be done with the consent of the parties. For example, a request for a

witness which, if litigated and approved at trial, would delay the proceedings

and cause expense or inconvenience, might be resolved at a conference. Note,

however, that this could only be done by an agreement of the parties and

not by a binding ruling of the military judge. Such a resolution must be included

in the record. _See_ subsection (b) below.

  A

military judge may not participate in negotiations relating to pleas. _

See_ R.C.M. 705 and Mil. R. Evid. 410.

  No place

or method is prescribed for conducting a conference.

A conference may be conducted by remote means or similar technology consistent with the definition in R.C.M. 914B.



### (b) Matters on record.

Conferences need not be made part of the record, but matters agreed

upon at a conference shall be included in the record orally or in writing.

Failure of a party to object at trial to failure to comply with this subsection

 shall waive this requirement.

### (c) Rights of parties.

No party may be prevented under this rule from presenting evidence

or from making any argument, objection, or motion at trial.

### (d) Accused's presence.

The presence of the accused is neither required nor prohibited at

a conference.

#### Discussion

Normally the defense counsel may be presumed to speak for the accused.

### (e) Admission.

No admissions made by the accused or defense counsel at a conference

shall be used against the accused unless the admissions are reduced to writing

and signed by the accused and defense counsel.

### (f) Limitations.

This rule shall not be invoked in the case of an accused who is

not represented by counsel, or in special court-martial without a military

judge.

## Rule 803. Court-martial sessions without members under Article 39(a)

A military judge who has been detailed to the court-martial may,

under Article 39(a), after service of charges, call the court-martial into

session without the presence of members. Such sessions may be held before

and after assembly of the court-martial, and when authorized in these rules,

after adjournment and before action by the convening authority. All such

sessions are a part of the trial and shall be conducted in the presence of

the accused, defense counsel, and trial counsel, in accordance with R.C.M.

804 and 805, and shall be made a part of the record. For purposes of this

rule "military judge" does not include the president of a special

court-martial without a military judge.

### Discussion

The purpose of Article 39(a) is "to give statutory sanction

to pretrial and other hearings without the presence of the members concerning

those matters which are amenable to disposition on either a tentative or

final basis by the military judge." The military judge and members may,

and ordinarily should, call the court-martial into session without members

to ascertain the accused's understanding of the right to counsel, the right

to request trial by military judge alone, or when applicable, enlisted members,

and the accused's choices with respect to these matters; dispose of interlocutory

matters; hear objections and motions; rule upon other matters that may legally

be ruled upon by the military judge, such as admitting evidence; and perform

other procedural functions which do not require the presence of members. _

See_, for example, R.C.M. 901-910. The military judge may, if

permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned, hold the arraignment,

receive pleas, and enter findings of guilty upon an accepted plea of guilty.

  Evidence

may be admitted and process, including a subpoena, may be issued to compel

attendance of witnesses and production of evidence at such sessions. _

See_ R.C.M. 703.

  Article 39(a) authorizes sessions

only after charges have been referred to trial and served on the accused,

but the accused has an absolute right to object, in time of peace, to any

session until the period prescribed by Article 35 has run.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 804 concerning waiver by the accused of the right to be

present. _See also_ R.C.M. 802 concerning conferences.

## Rule 804. Presence of the accused at trial proceedings

### (a) Presence required.

The accused shall be present at the arraignment, the time of the

plea, every stage of the trial including sessions conducted under Article

39(a), voir dire and challenges of members, the return of the findings, sentencing

proceedings, and post-trial sessions, if any, except as otherwise provided

by this rule.

### (b) Presence by remote means.

If authorized by the regulations of the Secretary concerned, the military judge may order the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology, between the parties and the military judge for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions. Use of such audiovisual technology will satisfy the "presence" requirement of the accused only when the accused has a defense counsel physically present at his location. Such technology may include two or more remote sites as long as all parties can see and hear each other.

#### (c) Continued presence not required.

The further progress of the trial to and including the return of

the findings and, if necessary, determination of a sentence shall not be

prevented and the accused shall be considered to have waived the right to

be present whenever an accused, initially present:

(1) Is voluntarily absent after arraignment (whether or not informed

by the military judge of the obligation to remain during the trial); or

(2) After being warned by the military judge that disruptive conduct

will cause the accused to be removed from the courtroom, persists in conduct

which is such as to justify exclusion from the courtroom.

###### Discussion

_Express waiver._ The accused may expressly waive

the right to be present at trial proceedings. There is no right to be absent,

however, and the accused may be required to be present over objection. Thus,

an accused cannot frustrate efforts to identify the accused at trial by waiving

the right to be present. The right to be present is so fundamental, and the

Government's interest in the attendance of the accused so substantial, that

the accused should be permitted to waive the right to be present only for

good cause, and only after the military judge explains to the accused the

right, and the consequences of foregoing it, and secures the accused's personal

consent to proceeding without the accused.

  _Voluntary

absence._ In any case the accused may forfeit the right to be present

 by being voluntarily absent after arraignment.

  "Voluntary

absence" means voluntary absence from trial. For an absence from court-martial

 proceedings to be voluntary, the accused must have known of the scheduled

proceedings and intentionally missed them. For example, although an accused

servicemember might voluntarily be absent without authority, this would not

justify proceeding with a court-martial in the accused's absence unless the

accused was aware that the court-martial would be held during the period

of the absence.

  An accused who is in military custody or

otherwise subject to military control at the time of trial or other proceeding

may not properly be absent from the trial or proceeding without securing the

permission of the military judge on the record.

  The prosecution

has the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the accused's

absence from trial is voluntary. Voluntariness may not be presumed, but it

may be inferred, depending on the circumstances. For example, it may be inferred,

in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that an accused who was present

when the trial recessed and who knew when the proceedings were scheduled to

resume, but who nonetheless is not present when court reconvenes at the designated

time, is absent voluntarily.

  Where there is some evidence

that an accused who is absent for a hearing or trial may lack mental capacity

to stand trial, capacity to voluntarily waive the right to be present for

trial must be shown. _See_ R.C.M. 909.

  Subsection

(1) authorizes but does not require trial to proceed in the absence of the

 accused upon the accused's voluntary absence. When an accused is absent from

trial after arraignment, a continuance or a recess may be appropriate, depending

on all the circumstances.

  Presence of the accused by remote means does not require the consent of the accused.

  _Removal for disruption.

_ Trial may proceed without the presence of an accused who has disrupted

the proceedings, but only after at least one warning by the military judge

that such behavior may result in removal from the courtroom. In order to

justify removal from the proceedings, the accused's behavior should be of

 such a nature as to materially interfere with the conduct of the proceedings.

  The

military judge should consider alternatives to removal of a disruptive accused.

Such alternatives include physical restraint (such as binding, shackling,

and gagging) of the accused, or physically segregating the accused in the

courtroom. Such alternatives need not be tried before removing a disruptive

accused under subsection (2). Removal may be preferable to such an alternative

as binding and gagging, which can be an affront to the dignity and decorum

of the proceedings.

  Disruptive behavior of the accused may

also constitute contempt. _See_ R.C.M. 809. When the accused

is removed from the courtroom for disruptive behavior, the military judge

should-

(A) Afford the accused and defense counsel ample opportunity to consult

throughout the proceedings. To this end, the accused should be held or otherwise

required to remain in the vicinity of the trial, and frequent recesses permitted

to allow counsel to confer with the accused.

(B) Take such additional steps as may be reasonably practicable to enable

the accused to be informed about the proceedings. Although not required,

technological aids, such as closed-circuit television or audio transmissions,

may be used for this purpose.

(C) Afford the accused a continuing opportunity to return to the courtroom

upon assurance of good behavior. To this end, the accused should be brought

to the courtroom at appropriate intervals, and offered the opportunity to

remain upon good behavior.

(D) Ensure that the reasons for removal appear in the record.

#### (d) Voluntary absence for limited purpose of child testimony.

##### (1) Election by accused.

Following a determination by the military judge that remote live

testimony of a child is appropriate pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 611(d)(3),

the accused may elect to voluntarily absent himself from the courtroom in

order to preclude the use of procedures described in R.C.M. 914A.

##### (2) Procedure.

The accused's absence will be conditional upon his being able to view the witness' testimony from a remote location. Normally, transmission of the testimony will include a system that will transmit the accused's image and voice into the courtroom from a remote location as well as transmission of the child's testimony from the courtroom to the accused's location. A one-way transmission may be used if deemed necessary by the military judge. The accused will also be provided private, contemporaneous communication with his counsel. The procedures described herein shall be employed unless the accused has made a knowing and affirmative waiver of these procedures.

##### (3) Effect on accused's rights generally.

An election by the accused to be absent pursuant to subsection (c)(1)

shall not otherwise affect the accused's right to be present at the remainder

of the trial in accordance with this rule.

#### (e) Appearance and security of accused.

##### (1) Appearance.

The accused shall be properly attired in the uniform or dress prescribed

by the military judge. An accused servicemember shall wear the insignia of

grade and may wear any decorations, emblems, or ribbons to which entitled.

The accused and defense counsel are responsible for ensuring that the accused

is properly attired; however, upon request, the accused's commander shall

render such assistance as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that the

accused is properly attired.

###### Discussion

This subsection recognizes the right, as well as the obligation,

of an accused servicemember to present a good military appearance at trial.

An accused servicemember who refuses to present a proper military appearance

before a court-martial may be compelled to do so.

##### (2) Custody.

Responsibility for maintaining custody or control of an accused

before and during trial may be assigned, subject to R.C.M. 304 and 305, and

subsection (c)(3) of this rule, under such regulations as the Secretary concerned

may prescribe.

##### (3) Restraint.

Physical restraint shall not be imposed on the accused during open

sessions of the court-martial unless prescribed by the military judge.

## Rule 805. Presence of military judge, members, and counsel

### (a) Military judge.

No court-martial proceeding, except the deliberations of the members,

may take place in the absence of the military judge, if detailed. If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions solely, the presence of the military judge at Article 39(a) sessions may be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology.

### (b) Members.

Unless trial is by military judge alone pursuant to a request by

the accused, no court-martial proceeding may take place in the absence of

any detailed member except: Article 39(a) sessions under R.C.M. 803; examination

 of members under R.C.M. 912(d); when the member has been excused under R.C.M.

505 or 912(f); or as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 1102. No general court-martial proceeding requiring the presence of members may be conducted unless at least five members are present, or in capital cases, at least 12 members are present except as provided in R.C.M. 501(a)(1)(B), where 12 members are not reasonably available because of physical conditions or military exigencies. No special court-martial proceeding requiring the presence of members may be conducted unless at least three members are present except as provided in R.C.M. 912(h). Except as provided in R.C.M. 503(a)(2),

when an enlisted accused has requested enlisted members, no proceeding requiring

 the presence of members may be conducted unless at least one-third of the

members actually sitting on the court-martial are enlisted persons.

### (c) Counsel.

As long as at least one qualified counsel for each party is present,

other counsel for each party may be absent from a court-martial session.

An assistant counsel who lacks the qualifications necessary to serve as counsel

for a party may not act at a session in the absence of such qualified counsel. If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions solely, the presence of counsel at Article 39(a) sessions may be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology. At least one qualified defense counsel shall be physically present with the accused.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 504(d) concerning qualifications of

counsel.

  Ordinarily, no court-martial proceeding should

take place if any defense or assistant defense counsel is absent unless the

accused expressly consents to the absence. The military judge may, however

proceed in the absence of one or more defense counsel, without the consent

of the accused, if the military judge finds that, under the circumstances,

a continuance is not warranted and that the accused's right to be adequately

 represented would not be impaired.

  _See_ R.C.M.

502(d)(6) and 505(d)(2) concerning withdrawal or substitution of counsel. _

See_ R.C.M. 506(d) concerning the right of the accused to proceed

without counsel.

### (d) Effect of replacement of member or military judge.

#### (1) Members.

When after presentation of evidence on the merits has begun, a new

member is detailed under R.C.M. 505(c)(2)(B), trial may not proceed unless

the testimony and evidence previously admitted on the merits, if recorded

verbatim, is read to the new member, or, if not recorded verbatim, and in

the absence of a stipulation as to such testimony and evidence, the trial

proceeds as if no evidence has been presented.

##### Discussion

When a new member is detailed, the military judge should give such instructions as may be appropriate. _See also_ R.C.M. 912 concerning voir dire and challenges.

  When the court-martial has been reduced below a quorum, a mistrial may be appropriate. See _R.C.M._ 915.

#### (2) Military judge.

When, after the presentation of evidence on the merits has begun

in trial before military judge alone, a new military judge is detailed under

R.C.M. 505(e)(2) trial may not proceed unless the accused requests, and the

military judge approves, trial by military judge alone, and a verbatim record

of the testimony and evidence or a stipulation thereof is read to the military

judge, or the trial proceeds as if no evidence had been presented.

## Rule 806. Public trial

### (a) In general.

Except as otherwise provided in this rule, courts-martial shall

be open to the public. For purposes of this rule, "public" includes

members of both the military and civilian communities.

#### Discussion

Because of the requirement for public trials, courts-martial must

be conducted in facilities which can accommodate a reasonable number of spectators.

Military exigencies may occasionally make attendance at courts-martial difficult

or impracticable, as, for example, when a court-martial is conducted on a

ship at sea or in a unit in a combat zone. This does not violate this rule.

However, such exigencies should not be manipulated to prevent attendance

at a court-martial. The requirements of this rule may be met even though

only servicemembers are able to attend a court-martial. Although not required,

servicemembers should be encouraged to attend courts-martial.

  When

public access to a court-martial is limited for some reason, including lack

of space, special care must be taken to avoid arbitrary exclusion of specific

groups or persons. This may include allocating a reasonable number of seats

to members of the press and to relatives of the accused, and establishing

procedures for entering and exiting from the courtroom. _See also

_ subsection (b) below. There is no requirement that there actually

be spectators at a court-martial.

  The fact that a trial

is conducted with members does not make it a public trial.

### (b) Control of spectators and closure.

#### (1) Control of spectators.

In order to maintain the dignity and decorum of the proceedings

or for other good cause, the military judge may reasonably limit the number

of spectators in, and the means of access to, the courtroom, and exclude

specific persons from the courtroom. When excluding specific persons, the

military judge must make findings on the record establishing the reason for

the exclusion, the basis for the military judge's belief that exclusion is

necessary, and that the exclusion is as narrowly tailored as possible.

##### Discussion

 The military judge must ensure that the dignity and decorum of the proceedings are maintained and that the other rights and interests of the parties and society are protected. Public access to a session may be limited, specific persons may be excluded from the courtroom, and, under unusual circumstances, a session may be closed.

 Exclusion of specific persons, if unreasonable under the circumstances, may violate the accused's right to a public trial, even though other spectators remain. Whenever specific persons or some members of the public are excluded, exclusion must be limited in time and scope to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is ordered. Prevention of over�

crowding or noise may justify limiting access to the courtroom. Disruptive or distracting appearance or conduct may justify excluding specific persons. Specific persons may be excluded when necessary to protect witnesses from harm or intimidation. Access may be reduced when no other means is available to relieve a witness' inability to testify due to embarrassment or extreme nervousness. Witnesses will ordinarily be excluded from the courtroom so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 615.

 For purposes of this rule, the term "victim of an alleged offense" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ.

#### (2) Right of victim to attend.

A victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused may not be excluded from a court-martial relating to the offense unless the military judge, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that hearing or proceeding. The right to attend requires reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of a court-martial relating to the offense.

#### (3) Right of victim to confer.

 A victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused has the reasonable right to confer with the trial counsel.

#### (4) Closure.

Courts-martial shall be open to the public unless (1) there is a

substantial probability that an overriding interest will be prejudiced if

the proceedings remain open; (2) closure is no broader than necessary to protect

the overriding interest; (3) reasonable alternatives to closure were considered

and found inadequate; and (4) the military judge makes case-specific findings

on the record justifying closure.

#### Discussion

The military judge is responsible for protecting both the accused's

right to, and the public's interest in, a public trial. A court-martial session

is "closed" when no member of the public is permitted to attend.

 A court-martial is not "closed" merely because the exclusion

of certain individuals results in there being no spectators present, as long

as the exclusion is not so broad as to effectively bar everyone who might

attend the sessions and is put into place for a proper purpose.

  A session may be closed over the objection of the accused or the public upon

meeting the constitutional standard set forth in this Rule. _See also

_ Mil. R. Evid. 412(c), 505(i), and 513(e)(2).

  The

accused may waive his right to a public trial. The fact that the prosecution

and defense jointly seek to have a session closed does not, however, automatically

justify closure, for the public has a right in attending courts-martial.

Opening trials to public scrutiny reduces the chance of arbitrary and capricious

decisions and enhances public confidence in the court-martial process.

  The most likely reason for a defense request to close court-martial proceedings

is to minimize the potentially adverse effect of publicity on the trial.

For example, a pretrial Article 39(a) hearing at which the admissibility of

a confession will be litigated may, under some circumstances, be closed, in

accordance with this Rule, in order to prevent disclosure to the public (and

hence to potential members) of the very evidence that may be excluded. When

such publicity may be a problem, a session should be closed only as a last

resort.

  There are alternative means of protecting the

proceedings from harmful effects of publicity, including a thorough _

voir dire_ (_see_ R.C.M. 912), and, if necessary, a

continuance to allow the harmful effects of publicity to dissipate

(_see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(1)). Alternatives that may occasionally be appropriate

and are usually preferable to closing a session include: directing members

not to read, listen to, or watch any accounts concerning the case; issuing

a protective order (_see_ R.C.M. 806(d)); selecting members

from recent arrivals in the command, or from outside the immediate area

(_see_ R.C.M. 503(a)(3)); changing the place of trial

(_see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(11)); or sequestering the members.

### (c) Photography and broadcasting prohibited.

Video and audio recording and the taking of photographs-except

 for the purpose of preparing the record of trial-in the courtroom during

 the proceedings and radio or television broadcasting of proceedings from

the courtroom shall not be permitted. However, the military judge may, as

a matter of discretion permit contemporaneous closed-circuit video or audio

transmission to permit viewing or hearing by an accused removed under R.C.M.

804 or by spectators when courtroom facilities are inadequate to accommodate

a reasonable number of spectators.

### (d) Protective orders.

The military judge may, upon request of any party or _sua

 sponte_, issue an appropriate protective order, in writing, to prevent

parties and witnesses from making extrajudicial statements that present

a substantial likelihood of material prejudice to a fair trial by impartial

 members. For purposes of this subsection, "military judge" does

not include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.

#### Discussion

  A protective order may proscribe extrajudicial statements

 by counsel, parties, and witnesses that might divulge prejudicial matter

not of public record in the case. Other appropriate matters may also be addressed

by such a protective order. Before issuing a protective order, the military

judge must consider whether other available remedies would effectively mitigate

the adverse effects that any publicity might create, and consider such an

order's likely effectiveness in ensuring an impartial court-martial panel.

A military judge should not issue a protective order without first providing

notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard. The military judge

must state on the record the reasons for issuing the protective order. If

the reasons for issuing the order change, the military judge may reconsider

the continued necessity for a protective order.

## Rule 807. Oaths

### (a) Definition.

"Oath" includes "affirmation."

#### Discussion

An affirmation is the same as an oath, except in an affirmation

the words "so help you God" are omitted.

### (b) Oaths in courts-martial.

#### (1) Who must be sworn.

##### (A) Court-martial personnel.

The military judge, members of a general or special court-martial,

 trial counsel, assistant trial counsel, defense counsel, associate defense

 counsel, assistant defense counsel, reporter, interpreter, and escort shall

take an oath to perform their duties faithfully. For purposes of this rule,

 "defense counsel," "associate defense counsel," and

 "assistant defense counsel," include detailed and individual

military and civilian counsel.

###### Discussion

Article 42(a) provides that regulations of the Secretary concerned

 shall prescribe: the form of the oath; the time and place of the taking

 thereof; the manner of recording it; and whether the oath shall be taken

for all cases in which the duties are to be performed or in each case separately.

In the case of certified legal personnel (Article 26(b); Article 27(b)) these

 regulations may provide for the administration of an oath on a one-time

basis. _See also_ R.C.M. 813 and 901 concerning the point

in the proceedings at which it is ordinarily determined whether the required

oaths have been taken or are then administered.

##### (B) Witnesses.

Each witness before a court-martial shall be examined on oath.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 307 concerning the requirement for an oath in preferral of charges. _See_ R.C.M. 405 and 702 concerning the requirements for an oath in Article 32 preliminary hearings and depositions.

 An accused making an unsworn statement is not a "witness." _See_ R.C.M. 1001(c)(2)(C).

 A victim of an offense of which the accused has been found guilty is not a "witness" when making an unsworn statement during the presentencing phase of a court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 1001A.

#### (2) Procedure for administering oaths.

Any procedure which appeals to the conscience of the person to whom

 the oath is administered and which binds that person to speak the truth,

or, in the case of one other than a witness, properly to perform certain

duties, is sufficient.

##### Discussion

When the oath is administered in a session to the military judge,

 members, or any counsel, all persons in the courtroom should stand. In those

rare circumstances in which the trial counsel testifies as a witness, the

military judge administers the oath.

  Unless otherwise prescribed

by the Secretary concerned the forms below may be used, as appropriate,

to administer an oath.

###### (A) Oath for military judge.

When the military judge is not previously sworn, the trial counsel

will administer the following oath to the military judge:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully

 and impartially perform, according to your conscience and the laws applicable

to trial by court-martial, all the duties incumbent upon you as military

judge of this court-martial (,so help you God)?"

###### (B) Oath for members.

The following oath, as appropriate, will be administered to the

members by the trial counsel:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will answer

 truthfully the questions concerning whether you should serve as a member

of this court-martial; that you will faithfully and impartially try, according

 to the evidence, your conscience, and the laws applicable to trial by court-martial,

the case of the accused now before this court; and that you will not disclose

or discover the vote or opinion of any particular member of the court (upon

a challenge or) upon the findings or sentence unless required to do so in

due course of law (,so help you God)?"

###### (C) Oaths for counsel.

When counsel for either side, including any associate or assistant,

is not previously sworn the following oath, as appropriate, will be administered

by the military judge:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully

 perform all the duties of (trial) (assistant trial) (defense)(associate

defense) (assistant defense) counsel in the case now in hearing (,so help

you God)?"

###### (D) Oath for reporter.

The trial counsel will administer the following oath to every reporter

of a court-martial who has not been previously sworn:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully

 perform the duties of reporter to this court-martial (,so help you God)?"

###### (E) Oath for interpreter.

The trial counsel or the summary court-martial shall administer

the following oath to every interpreter in the trial of any case before a

 court-martial:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that in the case now

in hearing you will interpret truly the testimony you are called upon to

interpret (,so help you God)?"

###### (F) Oath for witnesses.

The trial counsel or the summary court-martial will administer

the following oath to each witness before the witness first testifies in

a case:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you

 shall give in the case now in hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth,

and nothing but the truth (,so help you God)?"

###### (G) Oath for escort.

The escort on views or inspections by the court-martial will, before

serving, take the following oath, which will be administered by the trial

counsel:

  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will escort

the court-martial and will well and truly point out to them (the place in

which the offense charged in this case is alleged to have been committed)

 (); and that you will not speak to the members concerning

(the alleged offense) (), except to describe (the

place aforesaid) () (,so help you God)?"



  _See_ Article 136 concerning persons

 authorized to administer oaths.

## Rule 808. Record of trial

The trial counsel of a general or special court-martial shall take

 such action as may be necessary to ensure that a record which will meet

the requirements of R.C.M. 1103 can be prepared.

### Discussion

Except in a special court-martial not authorized to adjudge a bad-conduct

discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for

more than six months, the trial counsel should ensure that a qualified court

reporter is detailed to the court-martial. Trial counsel should also ensure

that all exhibits and other documents relating to the case are properly maintained

for later inclusion in the record. _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(j)

as to the use of videotapes, audiotapes, and similar recordings for the record

of trial. Because of the potential requirement for a verbatim transcript,

all proceedings, including sidebar conferences, arguments, and rulings and

instructions by the military judge, should be recorded.

  Where

there is recorder failure or loss of court reporter's notes, the record should

be reconstructed as completely as possible. _See also_ R.C.M.

1103(f). If the interruption is discovered during trial, the military judge

should summarize or reconstruct the portion of the proceedings which has

not been recorded and then proceed anew and repeat the proceedings from the

point where the interruption began.

  _See_ R.C.M. 1305 concerning the record of trial in summary courts-martial.

  _See_ DD Forms 490 (Record of Trial), 491 (Summarized Record of Trial),

and 491-1 (Summarized Record of Trial-Article 39(a) Session).

## Rule 809. Contempt proceedings

### (a) In general.

Courts-martial may exercise contempt power under Article 48.

#### Discussion

 Article 48 makes punishable "direct" contempt, as well as "indirect" or "constructive" contempt. "Direct" contempt is that which is committed in the presence of the court-martial or its immediate proximity. "Presence" includes those places outside the courtroom itself, such as waiting areas, deliberation rooms, and other places set aside for the use of the court-martial while it is in session. "Indirect" or "constructive" contempt is non-compliance with lawful writs, processes, orders, rules, decrees, or commands of the court-martial. A "direct" or "indirect" contempt may be actually seen or heard by the court-martial, in which case it may be punished summarily. _See_ subsection (b)(1) below. A "direct" or "indirect" contempt may also be a contempt not actually observed by the court-martial, for example, when an unseen person makes loud noises, whether inside or outside the courtroom, which impede the orderly progress of the proceedings. In such a case the procedures for punishing for contempt are more extensive. _See_ subsection (b)(2) below.

 The words "any person," as used in Article 48, include all persons, whether or not subject to military law, except the military judge, members, and foreign nationals outside the territorial limits of the United States who are not subject to the code. The military judge may order the offender removed whether or not contempt proceedings are held. It may be appropriate to warn a person whose conduct is improper that persistence in a course of behavior may result in removal or punishment for contempt. _See_ R.C.M. 804, 806.

 Each contempt may be separately punished.

 A person subject to the code who commits contempt may be tried by court-martial or otherwise disciplined under Article 134 for such misconduct in addition to or instead of punishment for contempt. _See_ paragraph 108, Part IV; _see also_ Article 98. The 2011 amendment of Article 48 expanded the contempt power of military courts to enable them to enforce orders, such as discovery orders or protective orders regarding evidence, against military or civilian attorneys. Persons not subject to military jurisdiction under Article 2, having been duly subpoenaed, may be prosecuted in Federal civilian court under Article 47 for neglect or refusal to appear or refusal to qualify as a witness or to testify or to produce evidence.

### (b) Method of disposition.

#### (1) Summary disposition.

When conduct constituting contempt is directly witnessed by the

 court-martial, the conduct may be punished summarily.

#### (2) Disposition upon notice and hearing.

When the conduct apparently constituting contempt is not directly

 witnessed by the court-martial, the alleged offender shall be brought before

the court-martial and informed orally or in writing of the alleged contempt.

 The alleged offender shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present

evidence, including calling witnesses. The alleged offender shall have the

right to be represented by counsel and shall be so advised. The contempt

must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before it may be punished.

### (c) Procedure.

The military judge shall in all cases determine whether to punish

for contempt and, if so, what the punishment shall be. The military judge

shall also determine when during the court-martial the contempt proceedings

shall be conducted; however, if the court-martial is composed of members,

the military judge shall conduct the contempt proceedings outside the members'

presence. The military judge may punish summarily under subsection (b)(1)

only if the military judge recites the facts for the record and states that

they were directly witnessed by the military judge in the actual presence

of the court-martial. Otherwise, the provisions of subsection (b)(2) shall

apply.

### (d) Record; review.

A record of the contempt proceedings shall be part of the record

of the court-martial during which it occurred. If the person was held in

contempt, then a separate record of the contempt proceedings shall be prepared

and forwarded to the convening authority for review. The convening authority

may approve or disapprove all or part of the sentence. The action of the

convening authority is not subject to further review or appeal.

### (e) Sentence.

A sentence of confinement pursuant to a finding of contempt shall

 begin to run when it is adjudged unless deferred, suspended, or disapproved

by the convening authority. The place of confinement for a civilian or military

person who is held in contempt and is to be punished by confinement shall

be designated by the convening authority. A fine does not become effective

until ordered executed by the convening authority. The military judge may

delay announcing the sentence after a finding of contempt to permit the person

involved to continue to participate in the proceedings.

#### Discussion

The immediate commander of the person held in contempt, or, in the

 case of a civilian, the convening authority should be notified immediately

so that the necessary action on the sentence may be taken. _See_

R.C.M. 1101.

### (f) Informing person held in contempt.

The person held in contempt shall be informed by the convening

authority in writing of the holding and sentence, if any, of the court-martial

and of the action of the convening authority upon the sentence.

#### Discussion

Copies of this communication should be furnished to such other

persons including the immediate commander of the offender as may be concerned

with the execution of the punishment. A copy shall be included with the

record of both the trial and the contempt proceeding.

## Rule 810. Procedures for rehearings, new trials, and other trials

### (a) In general.

#### (1) Rehearings in full and new or other trials.

In rehearings which require findings on all charges and specifications

referred to a court-martial and in new or other trials, the procedure shall

be the same as in an original trial except as otherwise provided in this

rule.

#### (2) Rehearings on sentence only.

In a rehearing on sentence only, the procedure shall be the same

as in an original trial, except that the portion of the procedure which

ordinarily occurs after challenges and through and including the findings

 is omitted, and except as otherwise provided in this rule.

##### (A) Contents of the record.

The contents of the record of the original trial consisting of

evidence properly admitted on the merits relating to each offense of which

the accused stands convicted but not sentenced may be established by any

party whether or not testimony so read is otherwise admissible under Mil.

R. Evid. 804(b)(1) and whether or not it was given through an interpreter.

###### Discussion

Matters excluded from the record of the original trial on the merits

 or improperly admitted on the merits must not be brought to the attention

of the members as a part of the original record of trial.

##### (B) Plea.

The accused at a rehearing only on sentence may not withdraw any

plea of guilty upon which findings of guilty are based. However, if such

a plea is found to be improvident, the rehearing shall be suspended and the

matter reported to the authority ordering the rehearing.

#### (3) Combined rehearings.

When a rehearing on sentence is combined with a trial on the merits

 of one or more specifications referred to the court-martial, whether or

not such specifications are being tried for the first time or reheard, the

trial will proceed first on the merits, without reference to the offenses

being reheard on sentence only. After findings on the merits are announced,

the members, if any, shall be advised of the offenses on which the rehearing

on sentence has been directed. Additional challenges for cause may be permitted,

and the sentencing procedure shall be the same as at an original trial,

except as otherwise provided in this rule. A single sentence shall be adjudged

for all offenses.

### (b) Composition.

#### (1) Members.

No member of the court-martial which previously heard the case may

 sit as a member of the court-martial at any rehearing, new trial, or other

trial of the same case.

#### (2) Military judge.

The military judge at a rehearing may be the same military judge

who presided over a previous trial of the same case. The existence or absence

of a request for trial by military judge alone at a previous hearing shall

have no effect on the composition of a court-martial on rehearing.

#### (3) Accused's election.

The accused at a rehearing or new or other trial shall have the

same right to request enlisted members or trial by military judge alone

as the accused would have at an original trial.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 902; 903.

### (c) Examination of record of former proceedings.

No member may, upon a rehearing or upon a new or other trial, examine

the record of any former proceedings in the same case except:

(1) When permitted to do so by the military judge after such matters

have been received in evidence; or

(2) That the president of a special court-martial without a military

judge may examine that part of the record of former proceedings which relates

to errors committed at the former proceedings when necessary to decide the

admissibility of offered evidence or other questions of law, and such a part

of the record may be read to the members when necessary for them to consider

a matter subject to objection by any member.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(2).

  When a

rehearing is ordered, the trial counsel should be provided a record of the

former proceedings, accompanying documents, and any decision or review relating

to the case, as well as a statement of the reason for the rehearing.

### (d) Sentence limitations.

#### (1) In general.

Sentences at rehearings, new trials, or other trials shall be adjudged

within the limitations set forth in R.C.M. 1003. Except as otherwise provided

in subsection (d)(2) of this rule, offenses on which a rehearing, new trial,

or other trial has been ordered shall not be the basis for an approved sentence

in excess of or more severe than the sentence ultimately approved by the

convening or higher authority following the previous trial or hearing, unless

the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. When a rehearing or

sentencing is combined with trial on new charges, the maximum punishment that

may be approved by the convening authority shall be the maximum punishment

under R.C.M. 1003 for the offenses being reheard as limited above, plus the

total maximum punishment under R.C.M. 1003 for any new charges of which the

accused has been found guilty.  In the case of an "other trial"

no sentence limitations apply if the original trial was invalid because a

summary or special court-martial improperly tried an offense involving a mandatory

punishment or one otherwise considered capital.

##### Discussion

At a rehearing, the trier of fact is not bound by the sentence previously adjudged or approved.  The members should not be advised of the sentence limitation under this rule.  See R.C.M. 1005(e)(1).  An appropriate sentence on a retried or reheard offense should be adjudged without regard to any credit to which the accused may be entitled.  See R.C.M. 103(2) and R.C.M. 103(3) as to when a rehearing may be a capital case.

#### (2) Pretrial agreement.

If, after the earlier court-martial, the sentence was approved in

accordance with a pretrial agreement and at the rehearing the accused fails

to comply with the pretrial agreement, by failing to enter a plea of guilty

or otherwise, the approved sentence resulting at a rehearing of the affected

charges and specifications may include any otherwise lawful punishment not

in excess of or more serious than lawfully adjudged at the earlier court-martial.

### (e) Definition.

"Other trial" means another trial of a case in which

the original proceedings were declared invalid because of lack of jurisdiction

or failure of a charge to state an offense.

## Rule 811. Stipulations

### (a) In general.

The parties may make an oral or written stipulation to any fact,

the contents of a document, or the expected testimony of a witness.

### (b) Authority to reject.

The military judge may, in the interest of justice, decline to accept

 a stipulation.

#### Discussion

Although the decision to stipulate should ordinarily be left to

the parties, the military judge should not accept a stipulation if there

is any doubt of the accused's or any other party's understanding of the

nature and effect of the stipulation. The military judge should also refuse

to accept a stipulation which is unclear or ambiguous. A stipulation of fact

which amounts to a complete defense to any offense charged should not be

accepted nor, if a plea of not guilty is outstanding, should one which practically

amounts to a confession, except as described in the discussion under subsection

(c) of this rule. If a stipulation is rejected, the parties may be entitled

to a continuance.

### (c) Requirements.

Before accepting a stipulation in evidence, the military judge must

be satisfied that the parties consent to its admission.

#### Discussion

Ordinarily, before accepting any stipulation the military judge

should inquire to ensure that the accused understands the right not to stipulate,

understands the stipulation, and consents to it.

  If the

stipulation practically amounts to a confession to an offense to which a not

guilty plea is outstanding, it may not be accepted unless the military judge

ascertains: (A) from the accused that the accused understands the right not

to stipulate and that the stipulation will not be accepted without the accused's

consent; that the accused understands the contents and effect of the stipulation;

that a factual basis exists for the stipulation; and that the accused, after

consulting with counsel, consents to the stipulation; and (B) from the accused

and counsel for each party whether there are any agreements between the parties

in connection with the stipulation, and, if so, what the terms of such agreements

are.

  A stipulation practically amounts to a confession when

it is the equivalent of a guilty plea, that is, when it establishes, directly

or by reasonable inference, every element of a charged offense and when the

defense does not present evidence to contest any potential remaining issue

of the merits. Thus, a stipulation which tends to establish, by reasonable

inference, every element of a charged offense does not practically amount

to a confession if the defense contests an issue going to guilt which is not

foreclosed by the stipulation. For example, a stipulation of fact that contraband

drugs were discovered in a vehicle owned by the accused would normally practically

amount to a confession if no other evidence were presented on the issue,

but would not if the defense presented evidence to show that the accused was

unaware of the presence of the drugs. Whenever a stipulation establishes

the elements of a charged offense, the military judge should conduct an inquiry

as described above.

  If, during an inquiry into a confessional

stipulation the military judge discovers that there is a pretrial agreement,

the military judge must conduct an inquiry into the pretrial agreement. _

See_ R.C.M. 910(f). _See also_ R.C.M. 705.

### (d) Withdrawal.

A party may withdraw from an agreement to stipulate or from a stipulation

at any time before a stipulation is accepted; the stipulation may not then

be accepted. After a stipulation has been accepted a party may withdraw

from it only if permitted to do so in the discretion of the military judge.

#### Discussion

If a party withdraws from an agreement to stipulate or from a stipulation,

before or after it has been accepted, the opposing party may be entitled

to a continuance to obtain proof of the matters which were to have been

stipulated.

  If a party is permitted to withdraw from a stipulation

 previously accepted, the stipulation must be disregarded by the court-martial,

and an instruction to that effect should be given.

### (e) Effect of stipulation.

Unless properly withdrawn or ordered stricken from the record, a

 stipulation of fact that has been accepted is binding on the court-martial

and may not be contradicted by the parties thereto. The contents of a stipulation

of expected testimony or of a document's contents may be attacked, contradicted,

or explained in the same way as if the witness had actually so testified

or the document had been actually admitted. The fact that the parties so

stipulated does not admit the truth of the indicated testimony or document's

contents, nor does it add anything to the evidentiary nature of the testimony

or document. The Military Rules of Evidence apply to the contents of stipulations.

### (f) Procedure.

When offered, a written stipulation shall be presented to the military

judge and shall be included in the record whether accepted or not. Once accepted,

a written stipulation of expected testimony shall be read to the members,

if any, but shall not be presented to them; a written stipulation of fact

or of a document's contents may be read to the members, if any, presented

to them, or both. Once accepted, an oral stipulation shall be announced

to the members, if any.

## Rule 812. Joint and common trials

In joint trials and in common trials, each accused shall be accorded

 the rights and privileges as if tried separately.

### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5) concerning preparing charges

and specifications for joint trials. _See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(3)

concerning referral of charges for joint or common trials, and the distinction

 between the two. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(9) concerning motions

to sever and other appropriate motions in joint or common trials.

  In

a joint or common trial, each accused may be represented by separate counsel,

make challenges for cause, make peremptory challenges (_see_ R.C.M.

912), cross-examine witnesses, elect whether to testify, introduce evidence,

request that the membership of the court include enlisted persons, if an

enlisted accused, and, if a military judge has been detailed, request trial

by military judge alone.

  Where different elections are made

(and, when necessary, approved) as to court-martial composition a severance

is necessary. Thus, if one co-accused elects to be tried by a court-martial

composed of officers, and a second requests that enlisted members be detailed

to the court, and a third submits a request for trial by military judge

alone, which request is approved, three separate trials must be conducted.

  In

a joint or common trial, evidence which is admissible against only one or

some of the joint or several accused may be considered only against the accused

concerned. For example, when a stipulation is accepted which was made by

only one or some of the accused, the stipulation does not apply to those

accused who did not join it. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 306.

In such instances the members must be instructed that the stipulation or

evidence may be considered only with respect to the accused with respect

to whom it is accepted.

## Rule 813. Announcing personnel of the court-martial and accused

### (a) Opening sessions.

When the court-martial is called to order for the first time in

a case, the military judge shall ensure that the following is announced:

(1) The order, including any amendment, by which the court-martial is

 convened;

(2) The name, rank, and unit or address of the accused;

(3) The name and rank of the military judge, if one has been detailed;

(4) The names and ranks of the members, if any, who are present;

(5) The names and ranks of members who are absent, if presence of members

 is required;

(6) The names and ranks (if any) of counsel who are present;

(7) The names and ranks (if any) of counsel who are absent; and

(8) The name and rank (if any) of any detailed court reporter.

### (b) Later proceedings.

When the court-martial is called to order after a recess or adjournment

or after it has been closed for any reason, the military judge shall ensure

that the record reflects whether all parties and members who were present

at the time of the adjournment or recess, or at the time the court-martial

 closed, are present.

### (c) Additions, replacement, and absences of personnel.

Whenever there is a replacement of the military judge, any member,

or counsel, either through the appearance of new personnel or personnel

previously absent or through the absence of personnel previously present,

the military judge shall ensure the record reflects the change and the reason

for it.

# CHAPTER IX. TRIAL PROCEDURES THROUGH FINDINGS

## Rule 901. Opening session

### (a) Call to order.

A court-martial is in session when the military judge so declares.

#### Discussion

The military judge should examine the charge sheet, convening order,

 and any amending orders before calling the initial session to order.

  Article

35 provides that in time of peace, no proceedings, including Article 39(a)

 sessions, may be conducted over the accused's objection until five days have

 elapsed from the service of charges on the accused in the case of a general

court-martial. The period is three days for a special court-martial. In

computing these periods, the date of service and the date of the proceedings

 are excluded. Holidays and Sundays are not excluded. Failure to object waives

 the right to the waiting period, but if it appears that the waiting period

has not elapsed, the military judge should bring this to the attention of

the defense and secure an affirmative waiver on the record.

### (b) Announcement of parties.

After the court-martial is called to order, the presence or absence

 of the parties, military judge, and members shall be announced.

#### Discussion

If the orders detailing the military judge and counsel have not

been reduced to writing, an oral announcement of such detailing is required. _

See_ R.C.M. 503(b) and (c).

### (c) Swearing reporter and interpreter.

After the personnel have been accounted for as required in subsection

 (b) of this rule, the trial counsel shall announce whether the reporter

and interpreter, if any is present, have been properly sworn. If not sworn,

the reporter and interpreter, if any, shall be sworn.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 807 concerning the oath to be administered

to a court reporter or interpreter. If a reporter or interpreter is replaced

at any time during trial, this should be noted for the record, and the procedures

in this subsection should be repeated.

### (d) Counsel.

#### (1) Trial counsel.

The trial counsel shall announce the legal qualifications and status

 as to oaths of the members of the prosecution and whether any member of

the prosecution has acted in any manner which might tend to disqualify that

counsel.

#### (2) Defense counsel.

The detailed defense counsel shall announce the legal qualifications

 and status as to oaths of the detailed members of the defense and whether

any member of the defense has acted in any manner which might tend to disqualify

that counsel. Any defense counsel not detailed shall state that counsel's

legal qualifications, and whether that counsel has acted in any manner which

might tend to disqualify the counsel.

#### (3) Disqualification.

If it appears that any counsel may be disqualified, the military

 judge shall decide the matter and take appropriate action.

##### Discussion

Counsel may be disqualified because of lack of necessary qualifications,

or because of duties or actions which are inconsistent with the role of counsel. _

See_ R.C.M. 502(d) concerning qualifications of counsel.

  If

it appears that any counsel may be disqualified, the military judge should

conduct an inquiry or hearing. If any detailed counsel is disqualified, the

 appropriate authority should be informed. If any defense counsel is disqualified,

the accused should be so informed.

  If the disqualification

of trial or defense counsel is one which the accused may waive, the accused

should be so informed by the military judge, and given the opportunity to

decide whether to waive the disqualification. In the case of defense counsel,

if the disqualification is not waivable or if the accused elects not to

waive the disqualification, the accused should be informed of the choices

available and given the opportunity to exercise such options.

  If

any counsel is disqualified, the military judge should ensure that the accused

is not prejudiced by any actions of the disqualified counsel or any break

in representation of the accused.

  Disqualification of counsel

is not a jurisdictional defect; such error must be tested for prejudice.

  If

the membership of the prosecution or defense changes at any time during the

proceedings, the procedures in this subsection should be repeated as to the

new counsel. In addition, the military judge should ascertain on the record

whether the accused objects to a change of defense counsel. _See_

R.C.M. 505(d)(2) and 506(c).

#### (4) Inquiry.

 The military judge shall, in open session:

(A) Inform the accused of the rights to be represented by military

counsel detailed to the defense; or by individual military counsel requested

by the accused, if such military counsel is reasonably available; and by

civilian counsel, either alone or in association with military counsel, if

such civilian counsel is provided at no expense to the United States;

(B) Inform the accused that, if afforded individual military counsel,

the accused may request retention of detailed counsel as associate counsel,

which request may be granted or denied in the sole discretion of the authority

who detailed the counsel;

(C) Ascertain from the accused whether the accused understands these

 rights;

(D) Promptly inquire, whenever two or more accused in a joint or common

 trial are represented by the same detailed or individual military or civilian

counsel, or by civilian counsel who are associated in the practice of law,

with respect to such joint representation and shall personally advise each

accused of the right to effective assistance of counsel, including separate

representation. Unless it appears that there is good cause to believe no

conflict of interest is likely to arise, the military judge shall take appropriate

 measures to protect each accused's right to counsel; and

###### Discussion

Whenever it appears that any defense counsel may face a conflict

of interest, the military judge should inquire into the matter, advise the

accused of the right to effective assistance of counsel, and ascertain the

accused's choice of counsel. When defense counsel is aware of a potential

conflict of interest, counsel should discuss the matter with the accused.

If the accused elects to waive such conflict, counsel should inform the

military judge of the matter at an Article 39(a) session so that an appropriate

record can be made.

(E) Ascertain from the accused by whom the accused chooses to be represented.

#### (5) Unsworn counsel.

The military judge shall administer the oath to any counsel not

 sworn.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 807.

### (e) Presence of members.

In cases in which a military judge has been detailed, the procedures

 described in R.C.M. 901 through 903, 904 when authorized by the Secretary

concerned, and 905 through 910 shall be conducted without members present

in accordance with R.C.M. 803.

## Rule 902. Disqualification of military judge

### (a) In general.

Except as provided in subsection (e) of this rule, a military judge

 shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which that military

judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

### (b) Specific grounds.

A military judge shall also disqualify himself or herself in the

 following circumstances:

(1) Where the military judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning

 a party or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the

proceeding.

(2) Where the military judge has acted as counsel, preliminary hearing officer,

legal officer, staff judge advocate, or convening authority as to any offense

charged or in the same case generally.

(3) Where the military judge has been or will be a witness in the same

case, is the accuser, has forwarded charges in the case with a personal recommendation

as to disposition, or, except in the performance of duties as military judge

in a previous trial of the same or a related case, has expressed an opinion

 concerning the guilt or innocence of the accused.

(4) Where the military judge is not eligible to act because the military

 judge is not qualified under R.C.M. 502(c) or not detailed under R.C.M.

503(b).

(5) Where the military judge, the military judge's spouse, or a person

 within the third degree of relationship to either of them or a spouse of

such person:

(A) Is a party to the proceeding;

(B) Is known by the military judge to have an interest, financial or

 otherwise, that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;

or

(C) Is to the military judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness

 in the proceeding.

###### Discussion

A military judge should inform himself or herself about his or her

 financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself or herself

about the financial interests of his or her spouse and minor children living

in his or her household.

### (c) Definitions.

For the purposes of this rule the following words or phrases shall

 have the meaning indicated-

(1) "Proceeding" includes pretrial, trial, post-trial,

appellate review, or other stages of litigation.

(2) The "degree of relationship" is calculated according

to the civil law system.

##### Discussion

Relatives within the third degree of relationship are children,

 grandchildren, great grandchildren, parents, grandparents, great grandparents,

brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces.

(3) "Military judge" does not include the president of a

 special court-martial without a military judge.

### (d) Procedure.

(1) The military judge shall, upon motion of any party or _sua

 sponte_, decide whether the military judge is disqualified.

##### Discussion

There is no peremptory challenge against a military judge. A military

 judge should carefully consider whether any of the grounds for disqualification

in this rule exist in each case. The military judge should broadly construe

grounds for challenge but should not step down from a case unnecessarily.

  Possible

grounds for disqualification should be raised at the earliest reasonable

opportunity. They may be raised at any time, and an earlier adverse ruling

does not bar later consideration of the same issue, as, for example, when

additional evidence is discovered.

(2) Each party shall be permitted to question the military judge and

to present evidence regarding a possible ground for disqualification before

the military judge decides the matter.

##### Discussion

Nothing in this rule prohibits the military judge from reasonably

 limiting the presentation of evidence, the scope of questioning, and argument

on the subject so as to ensure that only matters material to the central

issue of the military judge's possible disqualification are considered, thereby,

preventing the proceedings from becoming a forum for unfounded opinion, speculation

or innuendo.

(3) Except as provided under subsection (e) of this rule, if the military

 judge rules that the military judge is disqualified, the military judge

shall recuse himself or herself.

### (e) Waiver.

No military judge shall accept from the parties to the proceeding

a waiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in subsection (b)

of this rule. Where the ground for disqualification arises only under subsection

(a) of this rule, waiver may be accepted provided it is preceded by a full

disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification.

## Rule 903. Accused's elections on composition of court-martial

### (a) Time of elections.

#### (1) Request for enlisted members.

Before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session or, in the

absence of such a session, before assembly, the military judge shall ascertain,

as applicable, whether an enlisted accused elects to be tried by a court-martial

including enlisted members. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion,

permit the accused to defer requesting enlisted members until any time before

 assembly, which time may be determined by the military judge.

#### (2) Request for trial by military judge alone.

Before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session, or, in the

 absence of such a session, before assembly, the military judge shall ascertain,

as applicable, whether in a noncapital case, the accused requests trial

by the military judge alone. The accused may defer requesting trial by military

judge alone until any time before assembly.

##### Discussion

Only an enlisted accused may request that enlisted members be detailed

to a court-martial. Trial by military judge alone is not permitted in capital

cases (_see_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(C)) or in special courts-martial

in which no military judge has been detailed.

### (b) Form of election.

#### (1) Request for enlisted members.

A request for the membership of the court-martial to include enlisted

 persons shall be in writing and signed by the accused or shall be made orally

on the record.

#### (2) Request for trial by military judge alone.

A request for trial by military judge alone shall be in writing

and signed by the accused or shall be made orally on the record.

### (c) Action on election.

#### (1) Request for enlisted members.

Upon notice of a timely request for enlisted members by an enlisted

 accused, the convening authority shall detail enlisted members to the court-martial

in accordance with R.C.M. 503 or prepare a detailed written statement explaining

why physical conditions or military exigencies prevented this. The trial

of the general issue shall not proceed until this is done.

#### (2) Request for military judge alone.

Upon receipt of a timely request for trial by military judge alone

 the military judge shall:

(A) Ascertain whether the accused has consulted with defense counsel

and has been informed of the identity of the military judge and of the right

to trial by members; and

###### Discussion

Ordinarily the military judge should inquire personally of the accused

to ensure that the accused's waiver of the right to trial by members is knowing

and understanding. Failure to do so is not error, however, where such knowledge

and understanding otherwise appear on the record.

  DD Form

1722 (Request for Trial Before Military Judge Alone (Art.16, UCMJ)) should

normally be used for the purpose of requesting trial by military judge alone

under this rule, if a written request is used.

(B) Approve or disapprove the request, in the military judge's discretion.

###### Discussion

A timely request for trial by military judge alone should be granted

 unless there is substantial reason why, in the interest of justice, the

military judge should not sit as factfinder. The military judge may hear

arguments from counsel before acting on the request. The basis for denial

of a request must be made a matter of record.

#### (3) Other.

In the absence of a request for enlisted members or a request for

 trial by military judge alone, trial shall be by a court-martial composed

of officers.

##### Discussion

Ordinarily if no request for enlisted members or trial by military

 judge alone is submitted, the military judge should inquire whether such

a request will be made (_see_ subsection (a)(1) of this rule)

unless these elections are not available to the accused.

### (d) Right to withdraw request.

#### (1) Enlisted members.

A request for enlisted members may be withdrawn by the accused as

a matter of right any time before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session,

 or, in the absence of such a session, before assembly.

#### (2) Military judge.

A request for trial by military judge alone may be withdrawn by

the accused as a matter of right any time before it is approved, or even

after approval, if there is a change of the military judge.

##### Discussion

Withdrawal of a request for enlisted members or trial by military

 judge alone should be shown in the record.

### (e) Untimely requests.

Failure to request, or failure to withdraw a request for enlisted

members or trial by military judge alone in a timely manner shall waive the

right to submit or to withdraw such a request. However, the military judge

may until the beginning of the introduction of evidence on the merits, as

a matter of discretion, approve an untimely request or withdrawal of a request.

#### Discussion

In exercising discretion whether to approve an untimely request

or withdrawal of a request, the military judge should balance the reason

for the request (for example, whether it is a mere change of tactics or results

from a substantial change of circumstances) against any expense, delay, or

inconvenience which would result from granting the request.

### (f) Scope.

For purposes of this rule, "military judge" does not

 include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.

## Rule 904. Arraignment

Arraignment shall be conducted in a court-martial session and shall

 consist of reading the charges and specifications to the accused and calling

on the accused to plead. The accused may waive the reading.

### Discussion

Arraignment is complete when the accused is called upon to plead;

the entry of pleas is not part of the arraignment.

  When

authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, the arraignment should

be conducted at an Article 39(a) session when a military judge has been detailed.

 The accused may not be arraigned at a conference under R.C.M. 802.

  Once

the accused has been arraigned, no additional charges against that accused

may be referred to that court-martial for trial with the previously referred

charges. _ See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2).

  The defense

should be asked whether it has any motions to make before pleas are entered.

Some motions ordinarily must be made before a plea is entered. _ See

_ R.C.M. 905(b).

## Rule 905. Motions generally

### (a) Definitions and form.

A motion is an application to the military judge for particular

 relief. Motions may be oral or, at the discretion of the military judge,

 written. A motion shall state the grounds upon which it is made and shall

set forth the ruling or relief sought. The substance of a motion, not its

form or designation, shall control.

#### Discussion

Motions may be motions to suppress [(_see_ R.C.M.

 905(b)(3))]; motions for appropriate relief (_see_ R.C.M.

 906); motions to dismiss (_see_ R.C.M. 907); or motions for

findings of not guilty (_see_ R.C.M. 917).

### (b) Pretrial motions.

Any defense, objection, or request which is capable of determination

 without the trial of the general issue of guilt may be raised before trial.

The following must be raised before a plea is entered:

(1) Defenses or objections based on defects (other than jurisdictional

 defects) in the preferral, forwarding, investigation, or referral of charges;

##### Discussion

Such nonjurisdictional defects include unsworn charges, inadequate

 Article 32 preliminary hearing, and inadequate pretrial advice. _See_

R.C.M. 307; 401-407; 601-604.

(2) Defenses or objections based on defects in the charges and specifications

(other than any failure to show jurisdiction or to charge an offense, which

objections shall be resolved by the military judge at any time during the

pendency of the proceedings);

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 307; 906(b)(3).

(3) Motions to suppress evidence;

##### Discussion

Mil. R. Evid. 304(d), 311(d), and 321(c) deal with the admissibility

 of confessions and admissions, evidence obtained from unlawful searches

and seizures, and eyewitness identification, respectively. Questions concerning

the admissibility of evidence on other grounds may be raised by objection

at trial or by motions _in limine_. _ See_ R.C.M.

906(b)(13); Mil. R. Evid. 103(c); 104(a) and (c).

(4) Motions for discovery under R.C.M. 701 or for production of witnesses

 or evidence;

##### Discussion

 _See_ also R.C.M. 703; 1001(e).

(5) Motions for severance of charges or accused; or

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 812; 906(b)(9) and (10).

(6) Objections based on denial of request for individual military counsel

or for retention of detailed defense counsel when individual military counsel

has been granted.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 506(b); 906(b)(2).

### (c) Burden of proof.

#### (1) Standard.

Unless otherwise provided in this Manual, the burden of proof on

any factual issue the resolution of which is necessary to decide a motion

shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.

##### Discussion

_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 104(a) concerning the applicability

of the Military Rules of Evidence to certain preliminary questions.

#### (2) Assignment.

(A) Except as otherwise provided in this Manual the burden of persuasion

 on any factual issue the resolution of which is necessary to decide a motion

shall be on the moving party.

###### Discussion

 _See_, for example, subsection (c)(2)(B) of this

rule, R.C.M. 908 and Mil. R. Evid. 304(e), 311(e), and 321(d) for provisions

specifically assigning the burden of proof.

(B) In the case of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, denial

 of the right to speedy trial under R.C.M. 707, or the running of the statute

of limitations, the burden of persuasion shall be upon the prosecution.

### (d) Ruling on motions.

A motion made before pleas are entered shall be determined before

 pleas are entered unless, if otherwise not prohibited by this Manual, the

military judge for good cause orders that determination be deferred until

 trial of the general issue or after findings, but no such determination shall

 be deferred if a party's right to review or appeal is adversely affected.

Where factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the military

judge shall state the essential findings on the record.

#### Discussion

When trial cannot proceed further as the result of dismissal or

other rulings on motions, the court-martial should adjourn and a record of

the proceedings should be prepared for the convening authority. _See

_ R.C.M. 908(b)(4) regarding automatic stay of certain rulings and

orders subject to appeal under that rule. Notwithstanding the dismissal of

some specifications, trial may proceed in the normal manner as long as one

 or more charges and specifications remain. The promulgating orders should

reflect the action taken by the court-martial on each charge and specification,

including any which were dismissed by the military judge on a motion. _

See_ R.C.M. 1114.

### (e) Effect of failure to raise defenses or objections.

Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make motions

or requests which must be made before pleas are entered under subsection

(b) of this rule shall constitute waiver. The military judge for good cause

shown may grant relief from the waiver. Other motions, requests, defenses,

or objections, except lack of jurisdiction or failure of a charge to allege

an offense, must be raised before the court-martial is adjourned for that

case and, unless otherwise provided in this Manual, failure to do so shall

constitute waiver.

#### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 910(j) concerning matters waived

by a plea of guilty.

### (f) Reconsideration.

On request of any party or _sua sponte_, the military

 judge may, prior to authentication of the record of trial, reconsider any

ruling, other than one amounting to a finding of not guilty, made by the

military judge.

#### Discussion

Subsection (f) permits the military judge to reconsider any ruling

 that affects the legal sufficiency of any finding of guilt or the sentence. _

See_ R.C.M. 917(d) for the standard to be used to determine the

legal sufficiency of evidence. _See also_ R.C.M. 1102 concerning

 procedures for post-trial reconsideration. Different standards may apply

 depending on the nature of the ruling. _See United States v. Scaff

_, 29 M.J. 60 (C.M.A. 1989).

### (g) Effect of final determinations.

Any matter put in issue and finally determined by a court-martial,

 reviewing authority, or appellate court which had jurisdiction to determine

the matter may not be disputed by the United States in any other court-martial

of the same accused, except that, when the offenses charged at one court-martial

did not arise out of the same transaction as those charged at the court-martial

at which the determination was made, a determination of law and the application

of law to the facts may be disputed by the United States. This rule also

shall apply to matters which were put in issue and finally determined in

any other judicial proceeding in which the accused and the United States

or a Federal governmental unit were parties.

#### Discussion

 _See_ also R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Whether a matter

has been finally determined in another judicial proceeding with jurisdiction

to decide it, and whether such determination binds the United States in

another proceeding are interlocutory questions. _See_ R.C.M.

 801(e). It does not matter whether the earlier proceeding ended in an acquittal,

conviction, or otherwise, as long as the determination is final. Except

for a ruling which is, or amounts to, a finding of not guilty, a ruling ordinarily

is not final until action on the court-martial is completed. _See

_ Article 76; R.C.M. 1209. The accused is not bound in a court-martial

by rulings in another court-martial. _But see_ Article 3(b);

R.C.M. 202.

  The determination must have been made by a court-martial,

 reviewing authority, or appellate court, or by another judicial body, such

as a United States court. A pretrial determination by a convening authority

is not a final determination under this rule, although some decisions by

a convening authority may bind the Government under other rules. _

See_, for example, R.C.M. 601, 604, 704, 705.

  The

United States is bound by a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction

 even if the earlier determination is erroneous, except when the offenses

 charged at the second proceeding arose out of a different transaction from

those charged at the first and the ruling at the first proceeding was based

on an incorrect determination of law.

  A final determination

in one case may be the basis for a motion to dismiss or a motion for appropriate

relief in another case, depending on the circumstances. The nature of the

earlier determination and the grounds for it will determine its effect in

other proceedings.

  Examples:

(1) The military judge dismissed a charge for lack of personal jurisdiction,

 on grounds that the accused was only 16 years old at the time of enlistment

 and when the offenses occurred. At a second court-martial of the same accused

for a different offense, the determination in the first case would require

dismissal of the new charge unless the prosecution could show that since

that determination the accused had effected a valid enlistment or constructive

enlistment. _See_ R.C.M. 202. Note, however, that if the

initial ruling had been based on an error of law (for example, if the military

judge had ruled the enlistment invalid because the accused was 18 at the

time of enlistment) this would not require dismissal in the second court-martial

for a different offense.

(2) The accused was tried in United States district court for assault

on a Federal officer. The accused defended solely on the basis of alibi

and was acquitted. The accused is then charged in a court-martial with assault

on a different person at the same time and place as the assault on a Federal

 officer was alleged to have occurred. The acquittal of the accused in Federal

 district court would bar conviction of the accused in the court-martial.

In cases of this nature, the facts of the first trial must be examined to

determine whether the finding of the first trial is logically inconsistent

with guilt in the second case.

(3) At a court-martial for larceny, the military judge excluded evidence

of a statement made by the accused relating to the larceny and other uncharged

offenses because the statement was obtained by coercion. At a second court-martial

for an unrelated offense, the statement excluded at the first trial would

be inadmissible, based on the earlier ruling, if the first case had become

final. If the earlier ruling had been based on an incorrect interpretation

of law, however, the issue of admissibility could be litigated anew at the

second proceeding.

(4) At a court-martial for absence without authority, the charge and

specification were dismissed for failure to state an offense. At a later

court-martial for the same offense, the earlier dismissal would be grounds

for dismissing the same charge and specification, but would not bar further

 proceedings on a new specification not containing the same defect as the

original specification.

### (h) Written motions.

Written motions may be submitted to the military judge after referral

and when appropriate they may be supported by affidavits, with service and

opportunity to reply to the opposing party. Such motions may be disposed

of before arraignment and without a session. Upon request, either party is

entitled to an Article 39(a) session to present oral argument or have an

evidentiary hearing concerning the disposition of written motions.

### (i) Service.

Written motions shall be served on all other parties. Unless otherwise

directed by the military judge, the service shall be made upon counsel for

each party.

### (j) Application to convening authority.

Except as otherwise provided in this Manual, any matters which may

be resolved upon motion without trial of the general issue of guilt may be

submitted by a party to the convening authority before trial for decision.

Submission of such matter to the convening authority is not, except as otherwise

provided in this Manual, required, and is, in any event, without prejudice

to the renewal of the issue by timely motion before the military judge.

### (k) Production of statements on motion to suppress.

Except as provided in this subsection, R.C.M. 914 shall apply at

a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence under subsection (b)(3) of this

rule. For purposes of this subsection, a law enforcement officer shall be

deemed a witness called by the Government, and upon a claim of privilege the

military judge shall excise portions of the statement containing privileged

matter.

## Rule 906. Motions for appropriate relief

### (a) In general.

A motion for appropriate relief is a request for a ruling to cure

a defect which deprives a party of a right or hinders a party from preparing

for trial or presenting its case.

### (b) Grounds for appropriate relief.

The following may be requested by motion for appropriate relief.

This list is not exclusive.

#### (1) Continuances.

A continuance may be granted only by the military judge.

##### Discussion

The military judge should, upon a showing of reasonable cause, grant

a continuance to any party for as long and as often as is just. Article 40.

Whether a request for a continuance should be granted is a matter within

the discretion of the military judge. Reasons for a continuance may include:

 insufficient opportunity to prepare for trial; unavailability of an essential

witness; the interest of Government in the order of trial of related cases;

and illness of an accused, counsel, military judge, or member. _See

also_ R.C.M. 602; 803.

#### (2) Record of denial of individual military counsel or of denial of request to retain detailed counsel when a request for individual military counsel granted.

If a request for military counsel was denied, which

denial was upheld on appeal (if available) or if a request to retain detailed

counsel was denied when the accused is represented by individual military

counsel, and if the accused so requests, the military judge shall ensure

that a record of the matter is included in the record of trial, and may make

findings. The trial counsel may request a continuance to inform the convening

authority of those findings. The military judge may not dismiss the charges

or otherwise effectively prevent further proceedings based on this issue.

However, the military judge may grant reasonable continuances until the requested

military counsel can be made available if the unavailability results from

temporary conditions or if the decision of unavailability is in the process

 of review in administrative channels.

(3) Correction of defects in the Article 32 preliminary hearing or pretrial

advice.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 405; 406. If the motion is granted,

the military judge should ordinarily grant a continuance so the defect may

be corrected.

#### (4) Amendment of charges or specifications.

A charge or specification may not be amended over the accused's objection unless the amendment is minor within the meaning of R.C.M. 603(a).

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 307.

  An amendment

may be appropriate when a specification is unclear, redundant, inartfully

drafted, misnames an accused, or is laid under the wrong article. A specification

may be amended by striking surplusage, or substituting or adding new language.

Surplusage may include irrelevant or redundant details or aggravating circumstances

which are not necessary to enhance the maximum authorized punishment or to

explain the essential facts of the offense. When a specification is amended

after the accused has entered a plea to it, the accused should be asked to

plead anew to the amended specification. A bill of particulars (_see

_ subsection (b)(6) of this rule) may also be used when a specification

is indefinite or ambiguous.

  If a specification, although

stating an offense, is so defective that the accused appears to have been

misled, the accused should be given a continuance upon request, or, in an

appropriate case (_see_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3)), the specification

may be dismissed.

(5) Severance of a duplicitous specification into two or more specifications.

##### Discussion

Each specification may state only one offense. R.C.M. 307(c)(4). A duplicitous specification is one which alleges two or more separate offenses. Lesser included offenses (_see_ paragraph 3, Part IV) are not separate, nor is a continuing offense involving separate acts. The sole remedy for a duplicitous specification is severance of the specification into two or more specifications, each of which alleges a separate offense contained in the duplicitous specification. However, if the duplicitousness is combined with or results in other defects, such as misleading the accused, other remedies may be appropriate.  See subsection (b)(3) of this rule. _See also_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3).

#### (6) Bill of particulars.

A bill of particulars may be amended at any time, subject to such

conditions as justice permits.

##### Discussion

The purposes of a bill of particulars are to inform the accused

of the nature of the charge with sufficient precision to enable the accused

to prepare for trial, to avoid or minimize the danger of surprise at the

time of trial, and to enable the accused to plead the acquittal or conviction

in bar of another prosecution for the same offense when the specification

itself is too vague and indefinite for such purposes.

  A

bill of particulars should not be used to conduct discovery of the Government's

theory of a case, to force detailed disclosure of acts underlying a charge,

or to restrict the Government's proof at trial.

  A bill

of particulars need not be sworn because it is not part of the specification.

A bill of particulars cannot be used to repair a specification which is otherwise

not legally sufficient.

(7) Discovery and production of evidence and witnesses.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 701 concerning discovery. _See

_ R.C.M. 703, 914 and 1001(e) concerning production of evidence and

witnesses.

#### (8) Relief from pretrial confinement.

 Upon a motion for release from pretrial confinement, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the motion and any hearing, the right to confer with trial counsel, and the right to be reasonably heard. Inability to reasonably afford a victim these rights shall not delay the proceedings. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 305(j).

(9) Severance of multiple accused, if it appears that an accused or

the Government is prejudiced by a joint or common trial. In a common trial,

a severance shall be granted whenever any accused, other than the moving

accused, faces charges unrelated to those charged against the moving accused.

##### Discussion

 A motion for severance is a request that one or more accused against whom charges have been referred to a joint or common trial be tried separately. Such a request should be granted if good cause is shown. For example, a severance may be appropriate when: the moving party wishes to use the testimony of one or more of the coaccused or the spouse of a coaccused; a defense of a coaccused is antagonistic to the moving party; or evidence as to any other accused will improperly prejudice the moving accused.

 If a severance is granted by the military judge, the military judge will decide which accused will be tried first. See R.C.M. 801(a)(1). In the case of joint charges, the military judge will direct an appropriate amendment of the charges and specifications.

 _See_ also R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3); 604; 812.

(10) Severance of offenses, but only to prevent manifest injustice.

##### Discussion

Ordinarily, all known charges should be tried at a single court-martial.

Joinder of minor and major offenses, or of unrelated offenses is not alone

a sufficient ground to sever offenses. For example, when an essential witness

as to one offense is unavailable, it might be appropriate to sever that offense

to prevent violation of the accused's right to a speedy trial.

#### (11) Change of place of trial.

The place of trial may be changed when necessary to prevent prejudice

to the rights of the accused or for the convenience of the Government if

the rights of the accused are not prejudiced thereby.

##### Discussion

A change of the place of trial may be necessary when there exists

in the place where the court-martial is pending so great a prejudice against

the accused that the accused cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there,

or to obtain compulsory process over an essential witness.

  When

it is necessary to change the place of trial, the choice of places to which

the court-martial will be transferred will be left to the convening authority,

as long as the choice is not inconsistent with the ruling of the military

judge.

#### (12) Unreasonable multiplication of charges.

The military judge may provide a remedy, as provided below, if he or she finds there has been an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentence.

##### (i) As applied to findings.

 Charges that arise from substantially the same transaction, while not legally multiplicious, may still be unreasonably multiplied as applied to findings. When the military judge finds, in his or her discretion, that the offenses have been unreasonably multiplied, the appropriate remedy shall be dismissal of the lesser offenses or merger of the offenses into one specification.

##### (ii) As applied to sentence.

 Where the military judge finds that the nature of the harm requires a remedy that focuses more appropriately on punishment than on findings, he or she may find that there is an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence. If the military judge makes such a finding, the maximum punishment for those offenses determined to be unreasonably multiplied shall be the maximum authorized punishment of the offense carrying the greatest maximum punishment.

#### Discussion

Unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence is a limitation on the military's discretion to charge separate offenses and does not have a foundation in the Constitution. The concept is based on reasonableness and the prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. In contrast, multiplicity is grounded in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. It prevents an accused from being twice punished for one offense if it is contrary to the intent of Congress. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3). Therefore, a motion for relief from unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence differs from a motion to dismiss on the grounds of multiplicity.

  The following non-exhaustive factors should be considered when determining whether two or more offenses are unreasonably multiplied: whether the specifications are aimed at distinctly separate criminal acts; whether they represent or exaggerate the accused's criminality; whether they unreasonably increase his or her exposure to punishment; and whether they suggest prosecutorial abuse of discretion in drafting of the specifications. Because prosecutors are permitted to plead in the alternative based on exigencies of proof, a ruling on this motion ordinarily should be deferred until after findings are entered.

(13) Preliminary ruling on admissibility of evidence.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 104(c)

  A request

for a preliminary ruling on admissibility is a request that certain matters

 which are ordinarily decided during trial of the general issue be resolved

 before they arise, outside the presence of members. The purpose of such

a motion is to avoid the prejudice which may result from bringing inadmissible

 matters to the attention of court members.

  Whether to rule

on an evidentiary question before it arises during trial is a matter within

the discretion of the military judge. _But see_ R.C.M. 905(b)(3)

and (d); and Mil. R. Evid. 304(e)(2); 311(e)(2); 321(d)(2). Reviewability

of preliminary rulings will be controlled by the Supreme Court's decision

in_ Luce v. United States_, 469 U.S. 38 (1984).

(14) Motions relating to mental capacity or responsibility of the accused.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 706, 909, and 916(k) regarding procedures

and standards concerning the mental capacity or responsibility of the accused.

## Rule 907. Motions to dismiss

### (a) In general.

A motion to dismiss is a request to terminate further proceedings

as to one or more charges and specifications on grounds capable of resolution

without trial of the general issue of guilt.

#### Discussion

Dismissal of a specification terminates the proceeding with respect

 to that specification unless the decision to dismiss is reconsidered and

reversed by the military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 905(f). Dismissal

of a specification on grounds stated in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3)(A) below

does not ordinarily bar a later court-martial for the same offense if the

grounds for dismissal no longer exist. _See also_ R.C.M. 905(g)

and subsection (b)(2) below.

  _See_ R.C.M.

916 concerning defenses.

### (b) Grounds for dismissal.

Grounds for dismissal include the following-

#### (1) Nonwaivable grounds.

A charge or specification shall be dismissed at any stage of the

 proceedings if:

(A) The court-martial lacks jurisdiction to try the accused for the

 offense; or

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 201-203.

(B) The specification fails to state an offense.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)

#### (2) Waivable grounds.

A charge or specification shall be dismissed upon motion made by

the accused before the final adjournment of the court-martial in that case

if:

(A) Dismissal is required under R.C.M. 707;

(B) The statute of limitations (Article 43) has run, provided that,

if it appears that the accused is unaware of the right to assert the statute

of limitations in bar of trial, the military judge shall inform the accused

of this right;

###### Discussion

Except for certain offenses for which there is

either:

no limitation as to time;

or child abuse offenses for which a time limitation has been enacted and applies that is based upon the life of a child abuse victim,

_ see_ Article 43(a)

and (b)(2)

, a person charged with an offense

under the code may not be tried by court-martial over objection if sworn

 charges have not been received by the officer exercising summary court-martial

 jurisdiction over the command within five years. _See_ Article

43(b). This period may be tolled (Article 43(c) and (d)), extended (Article

43(e) and (g)), or suspended (Article 43(f)) under certain circumstances.

The prosecution bears the burden of proving that the statute of limitations

has been tolled, extended, or suspended if it appears that is has run.

  Some

offenses are continuing offenses and any period of the offense occurring

within the statute of limitations is not barred. Absence without leave, desertion,

and fraudulent enlistment are not continuing offenses and are committed,

respectively, on the day the person goes absent, deserts, or first receives

pay or allowances under the enlistment.

  When computing the

statute of limitations, periods in which the accused was fleeing from justice

 or periods when the accused was absent without leave or in desertion are

 excluded. The military judge must determine by a preponderance, as an interlocutory

matter, whether the accused was absent without authority or fleeing from

justice. It would not be necessary that the accused be charged with the absence

offense. In cases where the accused is charged with both an absence offense

and a non-absence offense, but is found not guilty of the absence offense,

the military judge would reconsider, by a preponderance, his or her prior

determination whether that period of time is excludable.

  If

sworn charges have been received by an officer exercising summary court-martial

jurisdiction over the command within the period of the statute, minor amendments

(_see_ R.C.M. 603(a)) may be made in the specification after

the statute of limitations has run. However, if new charges are drafted or

a major amendment made (_see_ R.C.M. 603(d)) after the statute

of limitations has run, prosecution is barred. The date of receipt of sworn

charges is excluded when computing the appropriate statutory period. The

date of the offense is included in the computation of the elapsed time. Article

43(g) allows the government time to reinstate charges dismissed as defective

or insufficient for any cause. The government would have up to six months

to reinstate the charges if the original period of limitations has expired

or will expire within six months of the dismissal.

  In some

cases, the issue whether the statute of limitations has run will depend on

the findings on the general issue of guilt. For example, where the date of

an offense is in dispute, a finding by the court-martial that the offense

occurred at an earlier time may affect a determination as to the running

of the statute of limitations.

  When the statute of limitations

has run as to a lesser included offense, but not as to the charged offense, _

see_ R.C.M. 920(e)(2) with regard to instructions on the lesser offense.

(C) The accused has previously been tried by court-martial or federal

 civilian court for the same offense, provided that:

(i) No court-martial proceeding is a trial in the sense of this rule

 unless presentation of evidence on the general issue of guilt has begun;

(ii) No court-martial proceeding which has been terminated under R.C.M.

 604(b) or R.C.M. 915 shall bar later prosecution for the same offense or

offenses, if so provided in those rules;

(iii) No court-martial proceeding in which an accused has been found guilty

 of any charge or specification is a trial in the sense of this rule until

the finding of guilty has become final after review of the case has been

fully completed; and

(iv) No court-martial proceeding which lacked jurisdiction to try the

 accused for the offense is a trial in the sense of this rule.

(D) Prosecution is barred by:

(i) A pardon issued by the President;

####### Discussion

A pardon may grant individual or general amnesty.

(ii) Immunity from prosecution granted by a person authorized to do

so;

####### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 704.

(iii) Constructive condonation of desertion established by unconditional

 restoration to duty without trial of a deserter by a general court-martial

convening authority who knew of the desertion; or

(iv) Prior punishment under Articles 13 or 15 for the same offense, if

 that offense was minor.

####### Discussion

 _See_ Articles 13 and 15(f). _See_ paragraph

1e of Part V for a definition of "minor" offenses.

#### (3) Permissible grounds.

A specification may be dismissed upon timely motion by the accused if one of the following is applicable:

##### (A) Defective.

When the specification is so defective that it substantially misled the accused, and the military judge finds that, in the interest of justice, trial should proceed on any remaining charges and specifications without undue delay; or

##### (B) Multiplicity.

When the specification is multiplicious with another specification, is unnecessary to enable the prosecution to meet the exigencies of proof through trial, review, and appellate action, and should be dismissed in the interest of justice. A charge is multiplicious if the proof of such charge also proves every element of another charge.

###### Discussion

  Multiplicity is a legal concept, arising from the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense. Absent legislative intent to the contrary, an accused cannot be convicted and punished for violations of two or more statutes if those violations arise from a single act. Where Congress intended to impose multiple punishments for the same act, imposition of such sentence does not violate the Constitution.

  Multiplicity differs from unreasonable multiplication of charges. If two offenses are not multiplicious, they nonetheless may constitute an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentence. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Unreasonable multiplication of charges is a limitation on the military's discretion to charge separate offenses. It does not have a foundation in the Constitution; it is based on reasonableness and the prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. The military judge is to determine, in his or her discretion, whether the charges constitute unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentencing. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12).

  To determine if two charges are multiplicious, the practitioner should first determine whether they are based on separate acts. If so, the charges are not multiplicious because separate acts may be charged and punished separately. If the charges are based upon a single act, the practitioner should next determine if Congress intended to impose multiple convictions and punishments for the same act. When there is no overt expression of congressional intent in the relevant statutes, such intent may be inferred based on the elements of the charged statutes and their relationship to each other or other principles of statutory interpretation. If each statute contains an element not contained in the other, it may be inferred that Congress intended they be charged and punished separately. Likewise, if each statute contains the same elements, it may be inferred that Congress did not intend they be charged and punished separately. A lesser included offense will always be multiplicious if charged separately, but offenses do not have to be lesser included to be multiplicious.

  Ordinarily, a specification should not be dismissed for multiplicity before trial. The less serious of any multiplicious specifications shall be dismissed after findings have been reached. Due consideration must be given, however, to possible post-trial or appellate action with regard to the remaining specification.

## Rule 908. Appeal by the United States

### (a) In general.

In a trial by a court-martial over which a military judge presides

 and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States may

appeal an order or ruling that terminates the proceedings with respect to

a charge or specification, or excludes evidence that is substantial proof

 of a fact material in the proceedings, or directs the disclosure of classified

information, or that imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information.

 The United States may also appeal a refusal by the military judge to issue

a protective order sought by the United States to prevent the disclosure

of classified information or to enforce such an order that has previously

been issued by the appropriate authority. However, the United States may

not appeal an order or ruling that is, or amounts to, a finding of not guilty

with respect to the charge or specification.

### (b) Procedure.

#### (1) Delay.

After an order or ruling which may be subject to an appeal by the

 United States, the court-martial may not proceed, except as to matters unaffected

by the ruling or order, if the trial counsel requests a delay to determine

whether to file notice of appeal under this rule. Trial counsel is entitled

to no more than 72 hours under this subsection.

#### (2) Decision to appeal.

The decision whether to file notice of appeal under this rule shall

 be made within 72 hours of the ruling or order to be appealed. If the Secretary

concerned so prescribes, the trial counsel shall not file notice of appeal

unless authorized to do so by a person designated by the Secretary concerned.

#### (3) Notice of appeal.

If the United States elects to appeal, the trial counsel shall

provide the military judge with written notice to this effect not later than

72 hours after the ruling or order. Such notice shall identify the ruling

or order to be appealed and the charges and specifications affected. Trial

counsel shall certify that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay

and (if the order or ruling appealed is one which excludes evidence) that

the evidence excluded is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.

#### (4) Effect on the court-martial.

Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)

of this rule, the ruling or order that is the subject of the appeal is automatically

stayed and no session of the court-martial may proceed pending disposition

by the Court of Criminal Appeals of the appeal, except that solely as to

charges and specifications not affected by the ruling or order:

(A) Motions may be litigated, in the discretion of the military judge,

at any point in the proceedings;

(B) When trial on the merits has not begun,

(i) a severance may be granted upon request of all the parties;

(ii) a severance may be granted upon request of the accused and when

 appropriate under R.C.M. 906(b)(10); or

(C) When trial on the merits has begun but has not been completed, a

 party may, on that party's request and in the discretion of the military

judge, present further evidence on the merits.

#### (5) Record.

Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)

of this rule, trial counsel shall cause a record of the proceedings to be

prepared. Such record shall be verbatim and complete to the extent necessary

to resolve the issues appealed. R.C.M. 1103(g), (h), and (i) shall apply

and the record shall be authenticated in accordance with R.C.M. 1104(a).

The military judge or the Court of Criminal Appeals may direct that additional

parts of the proceeding be included in the record; R.C.M. 1104(d) shall not

apply to such additions.

#### (6) Forwarding.

Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)

of this rule, trial counsel shall promptly and by expeditious means forward

the appeal to a representative of the Government designated by the Judge

Advocate General. The matter forwarded shall include: a statement of the

issues appealed; the record of the proceedings or, if preparation of the

record has not been completed, a summary of the evidence; and such other

matters as the Secretary concerned may prescribe. The person designated by

the Judge Advocate General shall promptly decide whether to file the appeal

with the Court of Criminal Appeals and notify the trial counsel of that

decision.

#### (7) Appeal filed.

If the United States elects to file an appeal, it shall be filed

 directly with the Court of Criminal Appeals, in accordance with the rules

of that court.

#### (8) Appeal not filed.

If the United States elects not to file an appeal, trial counsel

 promptly shall notify the military judge and the other parties.

#### (9) Pretrial confinement of accused pending appeal.

If an accused is in pretrial confinement at the time the United

 States files notice of its intent to appeal under subsection (3) above,

the commander, in determining whether the accused should be confined pending

 the outcome of an appeal by the United States, should consider the same

factors which would authorize the imposition of pretrial confinement under

R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B).

### (c) Appellate proceedings.

#### (1) Appellate counsel.

The parties shall be represented before appellate courts in proceedings

under this rule as provided in R.C.M. 1202. Appellate Government counsel

shall diligently prosecute an appeal under this rule.

#### (2) Court of Criminal Appeals.

An appeal under Article 62 shall, whenever practicable, have priority

 over all other proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeals. In determining

an appeal under Article 62, the Court of Criminal Appeals may take action

only with respect to matters of law.

#### (3) Action following decision of Court of Criminal Appeals.

After the Court of Criminal Appeals has decided any appeal under

 Article 62, the accused may petition for review by the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces, or the Judge Advocate General may certify a question

 to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The parties shall be notified

of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals promptly. If the decision

is adverse to the accused, the accused shall be notified of the decision

 and of the right to petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for

 review within 60 days orally on the record at the court-martial or in accordance

with R.C.M. 1203(d). If the accused is notified orally on the record, trial

counsel shall forward by expeditious means a certificate that the accused

was so notified to the Judge Advocate General, who shall forward a copy to

the clerk of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces when required by

the Court. If the decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals permits it, the

court-martial may proceed as to the affected charges and specifications pending

further review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces or the Supreme

Court, unless either court orders the proceedings stayed. Unless the case

 is reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, it shall be returned

 to the military judge or the convening authority for appropriate action

in accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals. If the

 case is reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, R.C.M. 1204

and 1205 shall apply.

### (d) Military judge.

For purposes of this rule, "military judge" does not

 include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.

## Rule 909. Capacity of the accused to stand trial by court-martial

### (a) In general.

No person may be brought to trial by court-martial if that person

is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him or

her mentally incompetent to the extent that he or she is unable to understand

 the nature of the proceedings against them or to conduct or cooperate intelligently

in the defense of the case.

#### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 916(k).

### (b) Presumption of capacity.

A person is presumed to have the capacity to stand trial unless

the contrary is established.

### (c) Determination before referral.

If an inquiry pursuant to R.C.M. 706 conducted before referral

concludes that an accused is suffering from a mental disease or defect that

renders him or her mentally incompetent to stand trial, the convening authority

before whom the charges are pending for disposition may disagree with the

conclusion and take any action authorized under R.C.M. 401, including referral

of the charges to trial. If that convening authority concurs with the conclusion,

he or she shall forward the charges to the general court-martial convening

 authority. If, upon receipt of the charges, the general court-martial convening

authority similarly concurs, then he or she shall commit the accused to the

custody of the Attorney General. If the general court-martial convening

authority does not concur, that authority may take any action that he or

she deems appropriate in accordance with R.C.M. 407, including referral of

the charges to trial.

### (d) Determination after referral.

After referral, the military judge may conduct a hearing to determine

 the mental capacity of the accused, either _sua sponte_ or

upon request of either party. If an inquiry pursuant to R.C.M. 706 conducted

 before or after referral concludes that an accused is suffering from a mental

 disease or defect that renders him or her mentally incompetent to stand

trial, the military judge shall conduct a hearing to determine the mental

capacity of the accused. Any such hearing shall be conducted in accordance

with paragraph (e) of this rule.

### (e) Incompetence determination hearing.

#### (1) Nature of issue.

The mental capacity of the accused is an interlocutory question

of fact.

#### (2) Standard.

Trial may proceed unless it is established by a preponderance of

the evidence that the accused is presently suffering from a mental disease

or defect rendering him or her mentally incompetent to the extent that he

or she is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings or to conduct

or cooperate intelligently in the defense of the case. In making this determination,

the military judge is not bound by the rules of evidence except with respect

to privileges.

(3) If the military judge finds the accused is incompetent to stand

 trial, the judge shall report this finding to the general court-martial

convening authority, who shall commit the accused to the custody of the

Attorney General

### (f) Hospitalization of the accused.

An accused who is found incompetent to stand trial under this rule

 shall be hospitalized by the Attorney General as provided in section 4241(d)

of title 18, United States Code. If notified that the accused has recovered

to such an extent that he or she is able to understand the nature of the

proceedings and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of the

case, then the general court-martial convening authority shall promptly

take custody of the accused. If, at the end of the period of hospitalization,

the accused's mental condition has not so improved, action shall be taken

in accordance with section 4246 of title 18, United States Code.

#### Discussion

Under section 4241(d) of title 18, the initial period of hospitalization

for an incompetent accused shall not exceed four months. However, in determining

whether there is a substantial probability the accused will attain the capacity

to permit the trial to proceed in the foreseeable future, the accused may

be hospitalized for an additional reasonable period of time. This additional

period of time ends either when the accused's mental condition is improved

so that trial may proceed, or when the pending charges against the accused

are dismissed. If charges are dismissed solely due to the accused's mental

condition, the accused is subject to hospitalization as provided in section

4246 of title 18.

### (g) Excludable delay.

All periods of commitment shall be excluded as provided by R.C.M.

 707(c). The 120-day time period under R.C.M. 707 shall begin anew on the

date the general court-martial convening authority takes custody of the

accused at the end of any period of commitment.

## Rule 910. Pleas

### (a) Alternatives.

#### (1) In general.

An accused may plead as follows: guilty; not guilty to an offense

as charged, but guilty of a named lesser included offense; guilty with exceptions,

with or without substitutions, not guilty of the exceptions, but guilty

of the substitutions, if any; or, not guilty. A plea of guilty may not be

received as to an offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged by

the court-martial.

##### Discussion

 _See_ paragraph 3, Part IV, concerning lesser included offenses. When the plea is to a lesser included offense without the use of exceptions and substitutions, the defense counsel should provide a written revised specification to be included in the record as an appellate exhibit.

  A plea of guilty to a lesser included offense does not bar the prosecution from proceeding on the offense as charged. _See also_ subsection (g) of this rule.

  A plea of guilty does not prevent the introduction of evidence, either in support of the factual basis for the plea, or, after findings are entered, in aggravation. _See_ R.C.M. 1001(b)(4).

#### (2) Conditional pleas.

With the approval of the military judge and the consent of the

Government, an accused may enter a conditional plea of guilty, reserving

the right, on further review or appeal, to review of the adverse determination

of any specified pretrial motion. If the accused prevails on further review

or appeal, the accused shall be allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty. The

Secretary concerned may prescribe who may consent for Government; unless

otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the trial counsel may consent

 on behalf of the Government.

### (b) Refusal to plead; irregular plea.

If an accused fails or refuses to plead, or makes an irregular plea,

 the military judge shall enter a plea of not guilty for the accused.

#### Discussion

An irregular plea includes pleas such as guilty without criminality

 or guilty to a charge but not guilty to all specifications thereunder. When

a plea is ambiguous, the military judge should have it clarified before

proceeding further.

### (c) Advice to accused.

Before accepting a plea of guilty, the military judge shall address

 the accused personally and inform the accused of, and determine that the

accused understands, the following:

(1) The nature of the offense to which the plea is offered, the mandatory

 minimum penalty, if any, provided by law, and the maximum possible penalty

provided by law;

##### Discussion

The elements of each offense to which the accused has pleaded guilty

 should be described to the accused. _See also_ subsection

(e) of this rule.

(2) In a general or special court-martial, if the accused is not represented

by counsel, that the accused has the right to be represented by counsel at

every stage of the proceedings;

##### Discussion

In a general or special court-martial, if the accused is not represented

by counsel, a plea of guilty should not be accepted.

(3) That the accused has the right to plead not guilty or to persist

in that plea if already made, and that the accused has the right to be tried

by a court-martial, and that at such trial the accused has the right to

confront and cross-examine witnesses against the accused, and the right against

self-incrimination;

(4) That if the accused pleads guilty, there will not be a trial of

any kind as to those offenses to which the accused has so pleaded, so that

by pleading guilty the accused waives the rights described in subsection

(c)(3) of this Rule; and

(5) That if the accused pleads guilty, the military judge will question

 the accused about the offenses to which the accused has pleaded guilty,

and, if the accused answers these questions under oath, on the record, and

in the presence of counsel, the accused's answers may later be used against

the accused in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.

##### Discussion

The advice in subsection (5) is inapplicable in a court-martial

in which the accused is not represented by counsel.

### (d) Ensuring that the plea is voluntary.

The military judge shall not accept a plea of guilty without first,

 by addressing the accused personally, determining that the plea is voluntary

and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea

agreement under R.C.M. 705. The military judge shall also inquire whether

the accused's willingness to plead guilty results from prior discussions

between the convening authority, a representative of the convening authority,

or trial counsel, and the accused or defense counsel.

### (e) Determining accuracy of plea.

The military judge shall not accept a plea of guilty without making

 such inquiry of the accused as shall satisfy the military judge that there

is a factual basis for the plea. The accused shall be questioned under oath

about the offenses.

#### Discussion

A plea of guilty must be in accord with the truth. Before the plea

is accepted, the accused must admit every element of the offense(s) to which

the accused pleaded guilty. Ordinarily, the elements should be explained

to the accused. If any potential defense is raised by the accused's account

of the offense or by other matter presented to the military judge, the military

judge should explain such a defense to the accused and should not accept

the plea unless the accused admits facts which negate the defense. If the

 statute of limitations would otherwise bar trial for the offense, the military

 judge should not accept a plea of guilty to it without an affirmative waiver

by the accused. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B).

  The

accused need not describe from personal recollection all the circumstances

necessary to establish a factual basis for the plea. Nevertheless the accused

must be convinced of, and able to describe all the facts necessary to establish

guilt. For example, an accused may be unable to recall certain events in

 an offense, but may still be able to adequately describe the offense based

on witness statements or similar sources which the accused believes to be

true.

  The accused should remain at the counsel table during

 questioning by the military judge.

### (f) Plea agreement inquiry.

#### (1) In general.

A plea agreement may not be accepted if it does not comply with

 R.C.M. 705.

#### (2) Notice.

The parties shall inform the military judge if a plea agreement

 exists.

##### Discussion

The military judge should ask whether a plea agreement exists. _

See_ subsection (d) of this rule. Even if the military judge fails

to so inquire or the accused answers incorrectly, counsel have an obligation

to bring any agreements or understandings in connection with the plea to

the attention of the military judge.

#### (3) Disclosure.

If a plea agreement exists, the military judge shall require disclosure

of the entire agreement before the plea is accepted, provided that in trial

before military judge alone the military judge ordinarily shall not examine

any sentence limitation contained in the agreement until after the sentence

of the court-martial has been announced.

#### (4) Inquiry.

The military judge shall inquire to ensure:

(A) That the accused understands the agreement; and

(B) That the parties agree to the terms of the agreement.

###### Discussion

If the plea agreement contains any unclear or ambiguous terms, the

 military judge should obtain clarification from the parties. If there is

doubt about the accused's understanding of any terms in the agreement, the

military judge should explain those terms to the accused.

### (g) Findings.

Findings based on a plea of guilty may be entered immediately upon

 acceptance of the plea at an Article 39(a) session unless:

(1) Such action is not permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned;

(2) The plea is to a lesser included offense and the prosecution intends

 to proceed to trial on the offense as charged; or

(3) Trial is by a special court-martial without a military judge, in

 which case the president of the court-martial may enter findings based on

the pleas without a formal vote except when subsection (g)(2) of this rule

applies.

##### Discussion

If the accused has pleaded guilty to some offenses but not to others,

 the military judge should ordinarily defer informing the members of the

offenses to which the accused has pleaded guilty until after findings on

the remaining offenses have been entered. _ See_ R.C.M. 913(a),

Discussion and R.C.M. 920(e), Discussion, paragraph 3.

### (h) Later action.

#### (1) Withdrawal by the accused.

If after acceptance of the plea but before the sentence is announced

 the accused requests to withdraw a plea of guilty and substitute a plea

of not guilty or a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense, the military

judge may as a matter of discretion permit the accused to do so.

#### (2) Statements by accused inconsistent with plea.

If after findings but before the sentence is announced the accused

 makes a statement to the court-martial, in testimony or otherwise, or presents

evidence which is inconsistent with a plea of guilty on which a finding

is based, the military judge shall inquire into the providence of the plea.

 If, following such inquiry, it appears that the accused entered the plea

improvidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect

a plea of not guilty shall be entered as to the affected charges and specifications.

##### Discussion

When the accused withdraws a previously accepted plea for guilty

or a plea of guilty is set aside, counsel should be given a reasonable time

to prepare to proceed. In a trial by military judge alone, recusal of the

military judge or disapproval of the request for trial by military judge

alone will ordinarily be necessary when a plea is rejected or withdrawn after

findings; in trial with members, a mistrial will ordinarily be necessary.

#### (3) Pretrial agreement inquiry.

After sentence is announced the military judge shall inquire into

any parts of a pretrial agreement which were not previously examined by

the military judge. If the military judge determines that the accused does

not understand the material terms of the agreement, or that the parties disagree

as to such terms, the military judge shall conform, with the consent of the

Government, the agreement to the accused's understanding or permit the accused

to withdraw the plea.

##### Discussion

 _See_ subsection (f)(3) of this rule.

### (i) Record of proceedings.

A verbatim record of the guilty plea proceedings shall be made in

 cases in which a verbatim record is required under R.C.M. 1103. In other

special courts-martial, a summary of the explanation and replies shall be

included in the record of trial. As to summary courts-martial, _see

_ R.C.M. 1305.

### (j) Waiver.

Except as provided in subsection (a)(2) of this rule, a plea of

 guilty which results in a finding of guilty waives any objection, whether

or not previously raised, insofar as the objection relates to the factual

 issue of guilt of the offense(s) to which the plea was made.

## Rule 911. Assembly of the court-martial

The military judge shall announce the assembly of the court-martial.

### Discussion

When trial is by a court-martial with members, the court-martial

is ordinarily assembled immediately after the members are sworn. The members

are ordinarily sworn at the first session at which they appear, as soon

as all parties and personnel have been announced. The members are seated

with the president, who is the senior member, in the center, and the other

members alternately to the president's right and left according to rank.

If the rank of a member is changed, or if the membership of the court-martial

changes, the members should be reseated accordingly.

  When

trial is by military judge alone, the court-martial is ordinarily assembled

immediately following approval of the request for trial by military judge

alone.

  Assembly of the court-martial is significant because

it marks the point after which: substitution of the members and military

judge may no longer take place without good cause (_see_ Article

29; R.C.M. 505; 902; 912); the accused may no longer, as a matter of right,

 request trial by military judge alone or withdraw such a request previously

approved (_see_ Article 16; R.C.M. 903(a)(2)(d)); and the

 accused may no longer request, even with the permission of the military judge,

 or withdraw from a request for, enlisted members (_see_ Article

25(c)(1); R.C.M. 903(a)(1)(d)).

## Rule 912. Challenge of selection of members; examination and challenges of members

### (a) Pretrial matters.

#### (1) Questionnaires.

Before trial the trial counsel may, and shall upon request of the

 defense counsel, submit to each member written questions requesting the

following information:

(A) Date of birth;

(B) Sex;

(C) Race;

(D) Marital status and sex, age, and number of dependents;

(E) Home of record;

(F) Civilian and military education, including, when available, major

 areas of study, name of school or institution, years of education, and degrees

received;

(G) Current unit to which assigned;

(H) Past duty assignments;

(I) Awards and decorations received;

(J) Date of rank; and

(K) Whether the member has acted as accuser, counsel, preliminary hearing officer, convening authority, or legal officer or staff judge advocate for

the convening authority in the case, or has forwarded the charges with a

 recommendation as to disposition.

 Additional information may

be requested with the approval of the military judge. Each member's responses

to the questions shall be written and signed by the member.

###### Discussion

Using questionnaires before trial may expedite voir dire and may

 permit more informed exercise of challenges.

  If the questionnaire

is marked or admitted as an exhibit at the court-martial it must be attached

to or included in the record of trial. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(D)(iv)

and (b)(3)(B).

#### (2) Other materials.

A copy of any written materials considered by the convening authority

 in selecting the members detailed to the court-martial shall be provided

to any party upon request, except that such materials pertaining solely

to persons who were not selected for detail as members need not be provided

unless the military judge, for good cause, so directs.

### (b) Challenge of selection of members.

#### (1) Motion.

Before the examination of members under subsection (d) of this rule

 begins, or at the next session after a party discovered or could have discovered

by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier,

that party may move to stay the proceedings on the ground that members were

selected improperly.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 502(a) and 503(a) concerning selection

of members. Members are also improperly selected when, for example, a certain

group or class is arbitrarily excluded from consideration as members.

#### (2) Procedure.

Upon a motion under subsection (b)(1) of this rule containing an

 offer of proof of matters which, if true, would constitute improper selection

of members, the moving party shall be entitled to present evidence, including

any written materials considered by the convening authority in selecting

the members. Any other party may also present evidence on the matter. If

the military judge determines that the members have been selected improperly,

the military judge shall stay any proceedings requiring the presence of members

until members are properly selected.

#### (3) Waiver.

Failure to make a timely motion under this subsection shall waive

the improper selection unless it constitutes a violation of R.C.M. 501(a),

502(a)(1), or 503(a)(2).

### (c) Stating grounds for challenge.

The trial counsel shall state any ground for challenge for cause

 against any member of which the trial counsel is aware.

### (d) Examination of members.

The military judge may permit the parties to conduct the examination

 of members or may personally conduct the examination. In the latter event

the military judge shall permit the parties to supplement the examination

 by such further inquiry as the military judge deems proper or the military

 judge shall submit to the members such additional questions by the parties

as the military judge deems proper. A member may be questioned outside the

presence of other members when the military judge so directs.

#### Discussion

Examination of the members is called "voir dire." If

the members have not already been placed under oath for the purpose of voir

dire (_see_ R.C.M. 807(b)(2) Discussion (B)), they should

 be sworn before they are questioned.

  The opportunity for

voir dire should be used to obtain information for the intelligent exercise

 of challenges; counsel should not purposely use voir dire to present factual

 matter which will not be admissible or to argue the case.

  The

nature and scope of the examination of members is within the discretion of

the military judge. Members may be questioned individually or collectively.

Ordinarily, the military judge should permit counsel to personally question

the members. Trial counsel ordinarily conducts an inquiry before the defense.

Whether trial counsel will question all the members before the defense begins

or whether some other procedure will be followed depends on the circumstances.

For example, when members are questioned individually outside the presence

of other members, each party would ordinarily complete questioning that member

 before another member is questioned. The military judge and each party may

conduct additional questioning, after initial questioning by a party, as

necessary.

  Ordinarily the members should be asked whether

they are aware of any ground for challenge against them. This may expedite

further questioning. The members should be cautioned, however, not to disclose

 information in the presence of other members which might disqualify them.

### (e) Evidence.

Any party may present evidence relating to whether grounds for

challenge exist against a member.

### (f) Challenges and removal for cause.

#### (1) Grounds.

A member shall be excused for cause whenever it appears that the

 member:

(A) Is not competent to serve as a member under Article 25(a), (b),

or (c);

(B) Has not been properly detailed as a member of the court-martial;

(C) Is an accuser as to any offense charged;

(D) Will be a witness in the court-martial;

(E) Has acted as counsel for any party as to any offense charged;

(F) Has been an a preliminary hearing officer as to any offense charged;

(G) Has acted in the same case as convening authority or as the legal

 officer or staff judge advocate to the convening authority;

(H) Will act in the same case as reviewing authority or as the legal

 officer or staff judge advocate to the reviewing authority;

(I) Has forwarded charges in the case with a personal recommendation

as to disposition;

(J) Upon a rehearing or new or other trial of the case, was a member

of the court-martial which heard the case before;

(K) Is junior to the accused in grade or rank, unless it is established

 that this could not be avoided;

(L) Is in arrest or confinement;

(M) Has formed or expressed a definite opinion as to the guilt or

 innocence of the accused as to any offense charged;

(N) Should not sit as a member in the interest of having the court-martial

free from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality.

####### Discussion

Examples of matters which may be grounds for challenge under subsection

(N) are that the member: has a direct personal interest in the result of

the trial; is closely related to the accused, a counsel, or a witness in

the case; has participated as a member or counsel in the trial of a closely

related case; has a decidedly friendly or hostile attitude toward a party;

or has an inelastic opinion concerning an appropriate sentence for the offenses

charged.

#### (2) When made.

##### (A) Upon completion of examination.

Upon completion of any examination under subsection (d) of this

rule and the presentation of evidence, if any, on the matter, each party

shall state any challenges for cause it elects to make.

##### (B) Other times.

A challenge for cause may be made at any other time during trial

when it becomes apparent that a ground for challenge may exist. Such examination

of the member and presentation of evidence as may be necessary may be made

in order to resolve the matter.

#### (3) Procedure.

Each party shall be permitted to make challenges outside the presence

 of the members. The party making a challenge shall state the grounds for

it. Ordinarily the trial counsel shall enter any challenges for cause before

the defense counsel. The military judge shall rule finally on each challenge.

When a challenge for cause is granted, the member concerned shall be excused.

The burden of establishing that grounds for a challenge exist is upon the

party making the challenge. A member successfully challenged shall be excused.

#### (4) Waiver.

The grounds for challenge in subsection (f)(1)(A) of this rule may

 not be waived except that membership of enlisted members in the same unit

as the accused may be waived. Membership of enlisted members in the same

unit as the accused and any other ground for challenge is waived if the party

knew of or could have discovered by the exercise of diligence the ground

for challenge and failed to raise it in a timely manner. Notwithstanding

 the absence of a challenge or waiver of a challenge by the parties, the

military judge may, in the interest of justice, excuse a member against whom

a challenge for cause would lie. When a challenge for cause has been denied the successful use of a peremptory challenge by either party, excusing the challenged member from further participation in the court-martial, shall preclude further consideration of the challenge of that excused member upon later review. Further, failure by the challenging party to exercise a peremptory challenge against

any member shall constitute waiver of further consideration of the challenge

upon later review.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 606(b) when a member may

be a witness.

### (g) Peremptory challenges.

#### (1) Procedure.

Each party may challenge one member peremptorily. Any member so

 challenged shall be excused. No party may be required to exercise a peremptory

challenge before the examination of members and determination of any challenges

for cause has been completed. Ordinarily the trial counsel shall enter any

peremptory challenge before the defense.

##### Discussion

Generally, no reason is necessary for a peremptory challenge. _

 But see Batson v. Kentucky_ 476 U.S. 79 (1986); _United States

v. Curtis_, 33 M.J. 101 (C.M.A. 1991), _cert. denied_,

 112 S.Ct. 1177 (1992); _United States v. Moore_, 28 M.J. 366

 (C.M.A. 1989); _United States v. Santiago-Davilla_, 26 M.J.

380 (C.M.A. 1988).

#### (2) Waiver.

Failure to exercise a peremptory challenge when properly called

upon to do so shall waive the right to make such a challenge. The military

judge may, for good cause shown, grant relief from the waiver, but a peremptory

challenge may not be made after the presentation of evidence before the members

has begun. However, nothing in this subsection shall bar the exercise of

a previously unexercised peremptory challenge against a member newly detailed

under R.C.M. 505(c)(2)(B), even if presentation of evidence on the merits

has begun.

##### Discussion

When the membership of the court-martial has been reduced below

a quorum (_see_ R.C.M. 501) or, when enlisted members have

been requested, the fraction of enlisted members has been reduced below

one-third, the proceedings should be adjourned and the convening authority

notified so that new members may be detailed. _See_ R.C.M.

505. _See also_ R.C.M. 805(d) concerning other procedures

when new members are detailed.

### (h) Special courts-martial without a military judge.

In a special court-martial without a military judge, the procedures

 in this rule shall apply, except that challenges shall be made in the presence

of the members and a ruling on any challenge for cause shall be decided

by a majority vote of the members upon secret written ballot in closed session.

The challenged member shall not be present at the closed session at which

the challenge is decided. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member

challenged. Before closing, the president shall give such instructions as

may be necessary to resolve the challenge. Each challenge shall be decided

 separately, and all unexcused members except the challenged member shall

participate. When only three members are present and one is challenged,

the remaining two may decide the challenge. When the president is challenged,

 the next senior member shall act as president for purposes of deciding the

challenge.

### (i) Definitions.

#### (1) Military judge.

For purpose of this rule, "military judge" does not

 include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.

#### (2) Witness.

For purposes of this rule, "witness" includes one who

 testifies at a court-martial and anyone whose declaration is received in

evidence for any purpose, including written declarations made by affidavit

or otherwise.

##### Discussion

For example, a person who by certificate has attested or otherwise

 authenticated an official record or other writing introduced in evidence

is a witness.

#### (3) Preliminary hearing officer.

For purposes of this rule, "preliminary hearing officer" includes any person who has examined charges under R.C.M. 405 and any person who was counsel for a member of a court of inquiry, or otherwise personally has conducted an investigation of the general matter involving the offenses charged.

## Rule 913. Presentation of the case on the merits

### (a) Preliminary instructions.

The military judge may give such preliminary instructions as may

be appropriate. If mixed pleas have been entered, the military judge should

ordinarily defer informing the members of the offenses to which the accused

pleaded guilty until after the findings on the remaining contested offenses

have been entered.

#### Discussion

Preliminary instructions may include a description of the duties

of members, procedures to be followed in the court-martial, and other appropriate

matters.

  Exceptions to the rule requiring the military judge

to defer informing the members of an accused's prior pleas of guilty include

cases in which the accused has specifically requested, on the record, that

the military judge instruct the members of the prior pleas of guilty and

cases in which a plea of guilty was to a lesser included offense within the

contested offense charged in the specification. _See_ R.C.M.

910(g), Discussion and R.C.M. 920(e), Discussion, paragraph 3.

### (b) Opening statements.

Each party may make one opening statement to the court-martial before

 presentation of evidence has begun. The defense may elect to make its statement

after the prosecution has rested, before the presentation of evidence for

the defense. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit the

parties to address the court-martial at other times.

#### Discussion

Counsel should confine their remarks to evidence they expect to

be offered which they believe in good faith will be available and admissible

and a brief statement of the issues in the case.

### (c) Presentation of evidence.

Each party shall have full opportunity to present evidence.

#### (1) Order of presentation.

 Ordinarily the following sequence shall be followed:

(A) Presentation of evidence for the prosecution;

(B) Presentation of evidence for the defense;

(C) Presentation of prosecution evidence in rebuttal;

(D) Presentation of defense evidence in surrebuttal;

(E) Additional rebuttal evidence in the discretion of the military judge;

 and

(F) Presentation of evidence requested by the military judge or members.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 801(a) and Mil. R. Evid. 611 concerning

control by the military judge over the order of proceedings.

#### (2) Taking testimony.

The testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally in open session,

 unless otherwise provided in this Manual.

##### Discussion

Each witness must testify under oath. _See_ R.C.M.

 807(b)(1)(B); Mil. R. Evid. 603. After a witness is sworn, the witness should

be identified for the record (full name, rank, and unit, if military, or

full name and address, if civilian). The party calling the witness conducts

direct examination of the witness, followed by cross-examination of the witness

by the opposing party. Redirect and re-cross-examination are conducted as

necessary, followed by any questioning by the military judge and members.

 _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 611; 614.

  All documentary

and real evidence (except marks or wounds on a person's body) should be

marked for identification when first referred to in the proceedings and should

be included in the record of trial whether admitted in evidence or not. _

See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(C), (c). "Real evidence" include

physical objects, such as clothing, weapons, and marks or wounds on a person's

body. If it is impracticable to attach an item of real evidence to the record,

the item should be clearly and accurately described by testimony, photographs,

or other means so that it may be considered on review. Similarly, when documentary

evidence is used, if the document cannot be attached to the record (as in

 the case of an original official record or a large map), a legible copy or

 accurate extract should be included in the record. When a witness points

to or otherwise refers to certain parts of a map, photograph, diagram, chart,

 or other exhibit, the place to which the witness pointed or referred should

be clearly identified for the record, either by marking the exhibit or by

an accurate description of the witness' actions with regard to the exhibit.

#### (3) Views and inspections.

The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit the court-martial

to view or inspect premises or a place or an article or object. Such a view

or inspection shall take place only in the presence of all parties, the

members (if any), and the military judge. A person familiar with the scene

may be designated by the military judge to escort the court-martial. Such

person shall perform the duties of escort under oath. The escort shall not

testify, but may point out particular features prescribed by the military

judge. Any statement made at the view or inspection by the escort, a party,

the military judge, or any member shall be made part of the record.

##### Discussion

A view or inspection should be permitted only in extraordinary

circumstances. The fact that a view or inspection has been made does not

necessarily preclude the introduction in evidence of photographs, diagrams,

 maps, or sketches of the place or item viewed, if these are otherwise admissible.

#### (4) Evidence subject to exclusion.

When offered evidence would be subject to exclusion upon objection,

 the military judge may, as a matter of discretion, bring the matter to the

attention of the parties and may, in the interest of justice, exclude the

evidence without an objection by a party.

##### Discussion

The military judge should not exclude evidence which is not objected

 to by a party except in extraordinary circumstances. Counsel should be permitted

to try the case and present the evidence without unnecessary interference

 by the military judge. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 103.

#### (5) Reopening case.

The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit a party

to reopen its case after it has rested.

## Rule 914. Production of statements of witnesses

### (a) Motion for production.

After a witness other than the accused has testified on direct

examination, the military judge, on motion of a party who did not call the

witness, shall order the party who called the witness to produce, for examination

and use by the moving party, any statement of the witness that relates to

the subject matter concerning which the witness has testified, and that is:

(1) In the case of a witness called by the trial counsel, in the possession

of the United States; or

(2) In the case of a witness called by the defense, in the possession

of the accused or defense counsel.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 701 (Discovery).

  Counsel

should anticipate legitimate demands for statements under this and similar

rules and avoid delays in the proceedings by voluntary disclosure before

 arraignment.

  This rule does not apply to investigations

under Article 32.

  As to procedures for certain government

information as to which a privilege is asserted, _see_ Mil.

R. Evid. 505; 506.

### (b) Production of entire statement.

If the entire contents of the statement relate to the subject matter

 concerning which the witness has testified, the military judge shall order

that the statement be delivered to the moving party.

### (c) Production of excised statement.

If the party who called the witness claims that the statement contains

matter that does not relate to the subject matter concerning which the witness

has testified, the military judge shall order that it be delivered to the

military judge. Upon inspection, the military judge shall excise the portions

of the statement that do not relate to the subject matter concerning which

the witness has testified, and shall order that the statement, with such

material excised, be delivered to the moving party. Any portion of a statement

that is withheld from an accused over objection shall be preserved by the

trial counsel, and, in the event of a conviction, shall be made available

to the reviewing authorities for the purpose of determining the correctness

of the decision to excise the portion of the statement.

### (d) Recess for examination of the statement.

Upon delivery of the statement to the moving party, the military

 judge may recess the trial for the examination of the statement and preparation

for its use in the trial.

### (e) Remedy for failure to produce statement.

If the other party elects not to comply with an order to deliver

a statement to the moving party, the military judge shall order that the

testimony of the witness be disregarded by the trier of fact and that the

trial proceed, or, if it is the trial counsel who elects not to comply, shall

declare a mistrial if required in the interest of justice.

### (f) Definition.

As used in this rule, a "statement" of a witness means:

(1) A written statement made by the witness that is signed or otherwise

 adopted or approved by the witness;

(2) A substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by the

 witness that is recorded contemporaneously with the making of the oral statement

and contained in a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording

or a transcription thereof; or

(3) A statement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription thereof,

 made by the witness to a Federal grand jury.

## Rule 914A. Use of remote live testimony of a child

### (a) General procedures.

A child shall be allowed to testify out of the presence of the

accused after the military judge has determined that the requirements of

Mil. R. Evid. 611(d)(3) have been satisfied. The procedure used to take such

 testimony will be determined by the military judge based upon the exigencies

 of the situation. At a minimum, the following procedures

shall be observed:

(1) The witness shall testify from a remote location outside the courtroom;

(2) Attendance at the remote location shall be limited to the child,

 counsel for each side (not including an accused pro se), equipment operators,

and other persons, such as an attendant for the child, whose presence is

deemed necessary by the military judge;

(3) Sufficient monitors shall be placed in the courtroom to allow viewing

 and hearing of the testimony by the military judge, the accused, the members,

the court reporter and the public;

(4) The voice of the military judge shall be transmitted into the remote

 location to allow control of the proceedings; and

(5) The accused shall be permitted private, contemporaneous communication

 with his counsel.

### (b) Definition.

As used in this rule, "remote live testimony" includes, but is not limited to, testimony by videoteleconference, closed circuit television, or similar technology.

### (c) Prohibitions.

The procedures described above shall not be used where the accused

 elects to absent himself from the courtroom pursuant to R.C.M. 804(c).

#### Discussion

For purposes of this rule, unlike R.C.M. 914B, remote means or similar technology does not include receiving testimony by telephone where the parties cannot see and hear each other.

## Rule 914B. Use of remote testimony

### (a) General procedures.

The military judge shall determine the procedures used to take testimony via remote means. At a minimum, all parties shall be able to hear each other, those in attendance at the remote site shall be identified, and the accused shall be permitted private, contemporaneous communication with his counsel.

#### (b) Definition.

As used in this rule, testimony via "remote means" includes, but is not limited to, testimony by videoteleconference, closed circuit television, telephone, or similar technology.

##### Discussion

This rule applies for all witness testimony other than child witness testimony specifically covered by Mil. R. Evid. 611(d) and R.C.M. 914A.  When utilizing testimony via remote means, military justice practitioners are encouraged to consult the procedure used in _In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation_, 129 F.R.D. 424 (D.P.R. 1989) and to read _United States v. Gigante_, 166 F.3d 75 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1114 (2000).

## Rule 915. Mistrial

### (a) In general.

The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, declare a mistrial

 when such action is manifestly necessary in the interest of justice because

of circumstances arising during the proceedings which cast substantial doubt

upon the fairness of the proceedings. A mistrial may be declared as to some

or all charges, and as to the entire proceedings or as to only the proceedings

after findings.

#### Discussion

The power to grant a mistrial should be used with great caution,

 under urgent circumstances, and for plain and obvious reasons. As examples,

a mistrial may be appropriate when inadmissible matters so prejudicial that

a curative instruction would be inadequate are brought to the attention of

the members or when members engage in prejudicial misconduct. Also a mistrial

is appropriate when the proceedings must be terminated because of a legal

defect, such as a jurisdictional defect, which can be cured; for example,

when the referral is jurisdictionally defective. _See also_ R.C.M.

 905(g) concerning the effect of rulings in one proceeding on later proceedings.

### (b) Procedure.

On motion for a mistrial or when it otherwise appears that grounds

 for a mistrial may exist, the military judge shall inquire into the views

of the parties on the matter and then decide the matter as an interlocutory

question.

#### Discussion

Except in a special court-martial without a military judge, the

 hearing on a mistrial should be conducted out of the presence of the members.

### (c) Effect of declaration of mistrial.

#### (1) Withdrawal of charges.

A declaration of a mistrial shall have the effect of withdrawing

the affected charges and specifications from the court-martial.

##### Discussion

Upon declaration of a mistrial, the affected charges are returned

to the convening authority who may refer them anew or otherwise dispose of

them. _See_ R.C.M. 401-407.

#### (2) Further proceedings.

A declaration of a mistrial shall not prevent trial by another

court-martial on the affected charges and specifications except when the

mistrial was declared after jeopardy attached and before findings, and the

declaration was:

(A) An abuse of discretion and without the consent of the defense; or

(B) The direct result of intentional prosecutorial misconduct designed

to necessitate a mistrial.

## Rule 916. Defenses

### (a) In general.

As used in this rule, "defenses" includes any special

 defense which, although not denying that the accused committed the objective

 acts constituting the offense charged, denies, wholly or partially, criminal

responsibility for those acts.

#### Discussion

Special defenses are also called "affirmative defenses."



"Alibi" and "good character" are not special defenses,

as they operate to deny that the accused committed one or more of the acts

 constituting the offense. As to evidence of the accused's good character,

 _see_ Mil. R. Evid. 404(a)(1). _See_ R.C.M.

701(b)(1) concerning notice of alibi.

### (b) Burden of proof.

#### (1) General rule.

Except as listed below in paragraphs (2) and (3), the prosecution shall have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense did not exist.

##### (2) Lack of mental responsibility.

The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.

###### (3) Mistake of fact as to age.

In the defense of mistake of fact as to age as described in Article 120b(d)(2) in a prosecution of a child sexual offense, the accused has the burden of proving mistake of fact as to age by a preponderance of the evidence.

### Discussion

A defense may be raised by evidence presented by the defense, the

 prosecution, or the court-martial. For example, in a prosecution for assault,

 testimony by prosecution witnesses that the victim brandished a weapon toward

the accused may raise a defense of self-defense. _ See_ subsection

(e) below. More than one defense may be raised as to a particular offense.

The defenses need not necessarily be consistent.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 920(e)(3) concerning instructions on defenses.

### (c) Justification.

A death, injury, or other act caused or done in the proper performance

of a legal duty is justified and not unlawful.

#### Discussion

The duty may be imposed by statute, regulation, or order. For example,

the use of force by a law enforcement officer when reasonably necessary in

the proper execution of a lawful apprehension is justified because the duty

to apprehend is imposed by lawful authority. Also, killing an enemy combatant

in battle is justified.

### (d) Obedience to orders.

It is a defense to any offense that the accused was acting pursuant

 to orders unless the accused knew the orders to be unlawful or a person of

 ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawful.

#### Discussion

Ordinarily the lawfulness of an order is finally decided by the

 military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 801(e). An exception might exist

 when the sole issue is whether the person who gave the order in fact occupied

a certain position at the time.

  An act performed pursuant

to a lawful order is justified. _See_ subsection (c) of this

rule. An act performed pursuant to an unlawful order is excused unless the

accused knew it to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding

would have known it to be unlawful.

### (e) Self-defense.

#### (1) Homicide or assault cases involving deadly force.

It is a defense to a homicide, assault involving deadly force, or

 battery involving deadly force that the accused:

(A) Apprehended, on reasonable grounds, that death or grievous bodily

 harm was about to be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and

(B) Believed that the force the accused used was necessary for protection

 against death or grievous bodily harm.

###### Discussion

The words "involving deadly force" described the factual

 circumstances of the case, not specific assault offenses. If the accused

is charged with simple assault, battery or any form of aggravated assault,

or if simple assault, battery or any form of aggravated assault is in issue

as a lesser included offense, the accused may rely on this subsection if

the test specified in subsections (A) and (B) is satisfied.

  The

test for the first element of self-defense is objective. Thus, the accused's

apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm must have been one which a

reasonable, prudent person would have held under the circumstances. Because

this test is objective, such matters as intoxication or emotional instability

 of the accused are irrelevant. On the other hand, such matters as the relative

 height, weight, and general build of the accused and the alleged victim,

and the possibility of safe retreat are ordinarily among the circumstances

which should be considered in determining the reasonableness of the apprehension

of death or grievous bodily harm.

  The test for the second

element is entirely subjective. The accused is not objectively limited to

the use of reasonable force. Accordingly, such matters as the accused's emotional

control, education, and intelligence are relevant in determining the accused's

actual belief as to the force necessary to repel the attack.

  _

See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 404(a)(2) as to evidence concerning the character

 of the victim.

#### (2) Certain aggravated assault cases.

It is a defense to assault with a dangerous weapon or means likely

to produce death or grievous bodily harm that the accused:

(A) Apprehended, on reasonable grounds, that bodily harm was about to

be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and

(B) In order to deter the assailant, offered but did not actually apply

 or attempt to apply such means or force as would be likely to cause death

or grievous bodily harm.

###### Discussion

The principles in the discussion of subsection (e)(1) of this rule

 concerning reasonableness of the apprehension of bodily harm apply here.

  If,

as a result of the accused's offer of a means or force likely to produce

grievous bodily harm, the victim was killed or injured unintentionally by

the accused, this aspect of self-defense may operate in conjunction with

the defense of accident (_see_ subsection (f) of this rule)

to excuse the accused's acts. The death or injury must have been an unintended

and unexpected result of the accused's exercise of the right of self-defense.

#### (3) Other assaults.

It is a defense to any assault punishable under Article 90, 91,

or 128 and not listed in subsections (e)(1) or (2) of this rule that the

accused:

(A) Apprehended, upon reasonable grounds, that bodily harm was about

to be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and

(B) Believed that the force that accused used was necessary for protection

against bodily harm, provided that the force used by the accused was less

than force reasonably likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.

###### Discussion

The principles in the discussion under subsection (e)(1) apply here.

  If,

in using only such force as the accused was entitled to use under this aspect

of self-defense, death or serious injury to the victim results, this aspect

of self-defense may operate in conjunction with the defense of accident

(_see_ subsection (f) of this rule) to excuse the accused's

acts. The death or serious injury must have been an unintended and unexpected

result of the accused's proper exercise of the right of self-defense.

#### (4) Loss of right to self-defense.

The right to self-defense is lost and the defenses described in

 subsections (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this rule shall not apply if the accused

was an aggressor, engaged in mutual combat, or provoked the attack which

gave rise to the apprehension, unless the accused had withdrawn in good faith

after the aggression, combat, or provocation and before the offense alleged

occurred.

##### Discussion

A person does not become an aggressor or provocateur merely because

 that person approaches another to seek an interview, even if the approach

is not made in a friendly manner. For example, one may approach another

and demand an explanation of offensive words or redress of a complaint. If

the approach is made in a nonviolent manner, the right to self-defense is

not lost.

  Failure to retreat, when retreat is possible,

does not deprive the accused of the right to self-defense if the accused

was lawfully present. The availability of avenues of retreat is one factor

 which may be considered in addressing the reasonableness of the accused's

 apprehension of bodily harm and the sincerity of the accused's belief that

the force used was necessary for self-protection.

#### (5) Defense of another.

The principles of self-defense under subsection (e)(1) through (4)

of this rule apply to defense of another. It is a defense to homicide, attempted

homicide, assault with intent to kill, or any assault under Article 90,

91, or 128 that the accused acted in defense of another, provided that the

 accused may not use more force than the person defended was lawfully entitled

to use under the circumstances.

##### Discussion

The accused acts at the accused's peril when defending another.

Thus, if the accused goes to the aid of an apparent assault victim, the

accused is guilty of any assault the accused commits on the apparent assailant

if, unbeknownst to the accused, the apparent victim was in fact the aggressor

and not entitled to use self-defense.

### (f) Accident.

A death, injury, or other event which occurs as the unintentional

and unexpected result of doing a lawful act in a lawful manner is an accident

and excusable.

#### Discussion

The defense of accident is not available when the act which caused

 the death, injury, or event was a negligent act.

### (g) Entrapment.

It is a defense that the criminal design or suggestion to commit

the offense originated in the Government and the accused had no predisposition

to commit the offense.

#### Discussion

The "Government" includes agents of the Government and

 persons cooperating with them (for example, informants). The fact that persons

acting for the Government merely afford opportunities or facilities for

the commission of the offense does not constitute entrapment. Entrapment

occurs only when the criminal conduct is the product of the creative activity

of law enforcement officials.

  When the defense of entrapment

is raised, evidence of uncharged misconduct by the accused of a nature similar

to that charged is admissible to show predisposition. _See_ Mil.

R. Evid. 404(b).

### (h) Coercion or duress.

It is a defense to any offense except killing an innocent person

that the accused's participation in the offense was caused by a reasonable

apprehension that the accused or another innocent person would be immediately

killed or would immediately suffer serious bodily injury if the accused did

not commit the act. The apprehension must reasonably continue throughout

the commission of the act. If the accused has any reasonable opportunity

to avoid committing the act without subjecting the accused or another innocent

person to the harm threatened, this defense shall not apply.

#### Discussion

The immediacy of the harm necessary may vary with the circumstances.

 For example, a threat to kill a person's wife the next day may be immediate

if the person has no opportunity to contact law enforcement officials or

otherwise protect the intended victim or avoid committing the offense before

then.

### (i) Inability.

It is a defense to refusal or failure to perform a duty that the

 accused was, through no fault of the accused, not physically or financially

able to perform the duty.

#### Discussion

The test of inability is objective in nature. The accused's opinion

 that a physical impairment prevented performance of the duty will not suffice

unless the opinion is reasonable under all the circumstances.

  If

the physical or financial inability of the accused occurred through the accused's

own fault or design, it is not a defense. For example, if the accused, having

knowledge of an order to get a haircut, spends money on other nonessential

items, the accused's inability to pay for the haircut would not be a defense.

### (j) Ignorance or mistake of fact.

#### (1) Generally.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, it is a defense

to an offense that the accused held, as a result of ignorance or mistake,

an incorrect belief of the true circumstances such that, if the circumstances

 were as the accused believed them, the accused would not be guilty of the

 offense. If the ignorance or mistake goes to an element requiring premeditation,

specific intent, willfulness, or knowledge of a particular fact, the ignorance

or mistake need only have existed in the mind of the accused. If the ignorance

or mistake goes to any other element requiring only general intent or knowledge,

the ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of the accused and

must have been reasonable under all the circumstances. However, if the accused's

 knowledge or intent is immaterial as to an element, then ignorance or mistake

 is not a defense.

#### (2) Child Sexual Offenses.

It is a defense to a prosecution for Article 120b(b), sexual assault of a child, and Article 120b(c), sexual abuse of a child, that, at the time of the offense, the accused reasonably believed that the child had attained the age of 16 years, if the child had in fact attained at least the age of 12 years. The accused must prove this defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

##### Discussion

Examples of ignorance or mistake which need only exist in fact include: ignorance of the fact that the person assaulted was an officer; belief that property allegedly stolen belonged to the accused; belief that a controlled substance was really sugar.

  Examples of ignorance or mistake which must be reasonable as well as actual include: belief that the accused charged with unauthorized absence had permission to go; belief that the accused had a medical "profile" excusing shaving as otherwise required by regulation. Some offenses require special standards of conduct (see, for example, paragraph 68, Part IV, Dishonorable failure to maintain sufficient funds); the element of reasonableness must be applied in accordance with the standards imposed by such offenses.

  Examples of offenses in which the accused's intent or knowledge is immaterial include: any rape of a child, or any sexual assault or sexual abuse of a child when the child is under 12 years old. However, such ignorance or mistake may be relevant in extenuation and mitigation.

  _See_ subsection (l)(1) of this rule concerning ignorance or mistake of law.

### (k) Lack of mental responsibility.

#### (1) Lack of mental responsibility.

It is an affirmative defense to any offense that, at the time of

the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result

of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature

 and quality or the wrongfulness of his or her acts. Mental disease or defect

 does not otherwise constitute a defense.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 706 concerning sanity inquiries; R.C.M.

909 concerning the capacity of the accused to stand trial; and R.C.M. 1102A

concerning any post-trial hearing for an accused found not guilty only by

reason of lack of mental responsibility.

#### (2) Partial mental responsibility.

A mental condition not amounting to a lack of mental responsibility

 under subsection (k)(1) of this rule is not an affirmative defense.

##### Discussion

Evidence of a mental condition not amounting to a lack of mental

responsibility may be admissible as to whether the accused entertained a state

of mind necessary to be proven as an element of the offense. The defense

must notify the trial counsel before the beginning of trial on the merits

if the defense intends to introduce expert testimony as to the accused's mental

condition. _See_ R.C.M. 701(b)(2).

#### (3) Procedure.

##### (A) Presumption.

The accused is presumed to have been mentally responsible at the

time of the alleged offense. This presumption continues until the accused

establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or she was not mentally

responsible at the time of the alleged offense.

###### Discussion

The accused is presumed to be mentally responsible, and this presumption

continues throughout the proceedings unless the finder of fact determines

that the accused has proven lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing

evidence. _See_ subsection (b) of this rule.

##### (B) Inquiry.

If a question is raised concerning the mental responsibility of

the accused, the military judge shall rule finally whether to direct an

inquiry under R.C.M. 706. In a special court-martial without a military judge,

 the president shall rule finally except to the extent that the question is

one of fact, in which case the president rules subject to objection by any

member.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(3) for the procedures for voting

on rulings of the president of a special court-martial without a military

judge.

  If an inquiry is directed, priority should be given

to it.

##### (C) Determination.

The issue of mental responsibility shall not be considered as an

 interlocutory question.

### (l) Not defenses generally.

#### (1) Ignorance or mistake of law.

Ignorance or mistake of law, including general orders or regulations,

 ordinarily is not a defense.

##### Discussion

For example, ignorance that it is a crime to possess marijuana is

not a defense to wrongful possession of marijuana.

  Ignorance

or mistake of law may be a defense in some limited circumstances. If the

accused, because of a mistake as to a separate nonpenal law, lacks the criminal

intent or state of mind necessary to establish guilt, this may be a defense.

For example, if the accused, under mistaken belief that the accused is entitled

to take an item under property law, takes an item, this mistake of law (as

to the accused's legal right) would, if genuine, be a defense to larceny.

On the other hand, if the accused disobeyed an order, under the actual but

mistaken belief that the order was unlawful, this would not be a defense

because the accused's mistake was as to the order itself, and not as to a

separate nonpenal law. Also, mistake of law may be a defense when the mistake

results from reliance on the decision or pronouncement of an authorized public

 official or agency. For example, if an accused, acting on the advice of an

 official responsible for administering benefits that the accused is entitled

to those benefits, applies for and receives those benefits, the accused

may have a defense even though the accused was not legally eligible for the

 benefits. On the other hand, reliance on the advice of counsel that a certain

course of conduct is legal is not, of itself, a defense.

#### (2) Voluntary intoxication.

Voluntary intoxication, whether caused by alcohol or drugs, is not

a defense. However, evidence of any degree of voluntary intoxication may

be introduced for the purpose of raising a reasonable doubt as to the existence

of actual knowledge, specific intent, willfulness, or a premeditated design

to kill, if actual knowledge, specific intent, willfulness, or premeditated

design to kill is an element of the offense.

##### Discussion

Intoxication may reduce premeditated murder to unpremeditated murder,

 but it will not reduce murder to manslaughter or any other lesser offense. _

See_ paragraph 43c(2)(c), Part IV.

  Although voluntary

intoxication is not a defense, evidence of voluntary intoxication may be

admitted in extenuation.

## Rule 917. Motion for a finding of not guilty

### (a) In general.

The military judge, on motion by the accused or _sua sponte

_, shall enter a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses charged

after the evidence on either side is closed and before findings on the general

issue of guilt are announced if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a

conviction of the offense affected. If a motion for a finding of not guilty

at the close of the prosecution's case is denied, the defense may offer

evidence on that offense without having reserved the right to do so.

### (b) Form of motion.

The motion shall specifically indicate wherein the evidence is

insufficient.

### (c) Procedure.

Before ruling on a motion for a finding of not guilty, whether made

 by counsel or _sua sponte_, the military judge shall give

each party an opportunity to be heard on the matter.

#### Discussion

The military judge ordinarily should permit the trial counsel to

 reopen the case as to the insufficiency specified in the motion.

  _

 See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(2) and (3) for additional procedures to be followed

in a special court-martial without a military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 1102(b)(2) for the military judge's authority, upon motion or sua sponte, to enter finding of not guilty after findings but prior to authentication of the record.

### (d) Standard.

A motion for a finding of not guilty shall be granted only in the

 absence of some evidence which, together with all reasonable inferences

and applicable presumptions, could reasonably tend to establish every essential

element of an offense charged. The evidence shall be viewed in the light

most favorable to the prosecution, without an evaluation of the credibility

of witnesses.

### (e) Motion as to greater offense.

A motion for a finding of not guilty may be granted as to part of

a specification and, if appropriate, the corresponding charge, as long as

a lesser offense charged is alleged in the portion of the specification

as to which the motion is not granted. In such cases, the military judge shall

 announce that a finding of not guilty has been granted as to specified language

in the specification and, if appropriate, corresponding charge. In cases

before members, the military judge shall instruct the members accordingly,

so that any findings later announced will not be inconsistent with the granting

of the motion.

### (f) Effect of ruling.

A ruling granting a motion for a finding of not guilty is final

when announced and may not be reconsidered. Such a ruling is a finding of

not guilty of the affected specification, or affected portion thereof, and,

when appropriate, of the corresponding charge. A ruling denying a motion

for a finding of not guilty may be reconsidered at any time prior to authentication

of the record of trial.

### (g) Effect of denial on review.

If all the evidence admitted before findings, regardless by whom

 offered, is sufficient to sustain findings of guilty, the findings need

not be set aside upon review solely because the motion for finding of not

guilty should have been granted upon the state of the evidence when it was

 made.

## Rule 918. Findings

### (a) General findings.

The general findings of a court-martial state whether the accused

is guilty of each offense charged. If two or more accused are tried together,

separate findings as to each shall be made.

#### (1) As to a specification.

General findings as to a specification may be: guilty; not guilty

of an offense as charged, but guilty of a named lesser included offense;

guilty with exceptions, with or without substitutions, not guilty of the

exceptions, but guilty of the substitutions, if any; not guilty only by reason

of lack of mental responsibility; or, not guilty. Exceptions and substitutions

may not be used to substantially change the nature of the offense or to

increase the seriousness of the offense or the maximum punishment for it.

##### Discussion

 _Exceptions and Substitutions._ One or more words or figures may be excepted from a specification and, when necessary, others substituted, if the remaining language of the specification, with or without substitutions, states an offense by the accused which is punishable by the court-martial. Changing the date or place of the offense may, but does not necessarily, change the nature or identity of an offense.

  If A and B are joint accused and A is convicted but B is acquitted of an offense charged, A should be found guilty by excepting the name of B from the specification as well as any other words indicating the offense was a joint one.

  _Lesser Included Offenses._  If the evidence fails to prove the offense charged but does prove an offense necessarily included in the offense charged, the fact finder may find the accused not guilty of the offense charged but guilty of the lesser included offense. _See_ paragraph 3 of Part IV concerning lesser included offenses.

  _Offenses arising from the same act or transaction._ The accused may be found guilty of two or more offenses arising from the same act or transaction, whether or not the offenses are separately punishable. _But see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12); 907(b)(3)(B); 1003(c)(1)(C).

#### (2) As to a charge.

 General findings as to a charge may be: guilty; not guilty, but

 guilty of a violation of Article ; not guilty only

by reason of lack of mental responsibility; or not guilty.

##### Discussion

Where there are two or more specifications under one charge, conviction

of any of those specifications requires a finding of guilty of the corresponding

charge. Under such circumstances any findings of not guilty as to the other

specifications do not affect that charge. If the accused is found guilty

of one specification and of a lesser included offense prohibited by a different

Article as to another specification under the same charge, the findings

as to the corresponding charge should be:

"Of the Charge as to specification

1: Guilty; as to specification 2: not guilty, but guilty of a violation of

Article ."

  An attempt should be found

as a violation of Article 80 unless the attempt is punishable under Articles

85, 94, 100, 104, or 128, in which case it should be found as a violation

of that Article.

  A court-martial may not find an offense

as a violation of an article under which it was not charged solely for the

purpose of increasing the authorized punishment or for the purpose of adjudging

less than the prescribed mandatory punishment.

### (b) Special findings.

In a trial by court-martial composed of military judge alone, the

 military judge shall make special findings upon request by any party. Special

findings may be requested only as to matters of fact reasonably in issue

as to an offense and need be made only as to offenses of which the accused

was found guilty. Special findings may be requested at any time before general

findings are announced. Only one set of special findings may be requested

by a party in a case. If the request is for findings on specific matters,

the military judge may require that the request be written. Special findings

may be entered orally on the record at the court-martial or in writing during

or after the court-martial, but in any event shall be made before authentication

and included in the record of trial.

#### Discussion

Special findings ordinarily include findings as to the elements

of the offenses of which the accused has been found guilty, and any affirmative

defense relating thereto.

  _See also_ R.C.M.

905(d); Mil. R. Evid. 304(d)(4); 311(d)(4); 321(f) concerning other findings

to be made by the military judge.

  Members may not make special

findings.

### (c) Basis of findings.

Findings may be based on direct or circumstantial evidence. Only

 matters properly before the court-martial on the merits of the case may

be considered. A finding of guilty of any offense may be reached only when

the factfinder is satisfied that guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable

 doubt.

#### Discussion

Direct evidence is evidence which tends directly to prove or disprove

 a fact in issue (for example, an element of the offense charged). Circumstantial

evidence is evidence which tends directly to prove not a fact in issue but

some other fact or circumstance from which, either alone or together with

other facts or circumstances, one may reasonably infer the existence or nonexistence

 of a fact in issue. There is no general rule for determining or comparing

the weight to be given to direct or circumstantial evidence.

  A

reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense. A reasonable

doubt is not mere conjecture; it is an honest, conscientious doubt suggested

by the evidence, or lack of it, in the case. An absolute or mathematical

certainty is not required. The rule as to reasonable doubt extends to every

element of the offense. It is not necessary that each particular fact advanced

by the prosecution which is not an element be proved beyond a reasonable

doubt.

  The factfinder should consider the inherent probability

or improbability of the evidence, using common sense and knowledge of human

nature, and should weigh the credibility of witnesses. A fact finder may

properly believe one witness and disbelieve others whose testimony conflicts

with that of the one. A factfinder may believe part of the testimony of a

witness and disbelieve other parts.

  Findings of guilty may

not be based solely on the testimony of a witness other than the accused

which is self-contradictory, unless the contradiction is adequately explained

by the witness. Even if apparently credible and corroborated, the testimony

of an accomplice should be considered with great caution.

## Rule 919. Argument by counsel on findings

### (a) In general.

After the closing of evidence, trial counsel shall be permitted

to open the argument. The defense counsel shall be permitted to reply. Trial

counsel shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal.

### (b) Contents.

Arguments may properly include reasonable comment on the evidence

in the case, including inferences to be drawn therefrom, in support of a

party's theory of the case.

#### Discussion

The military judge may exercise reasonable control over argument.

 _See_ R.C.M. 801(a)(3).



  Argument may include

comment about the testimony, conduct, motives, interests, and biases of

witnesses to the extent supported by the evidence. Counsel should not express

a personnel belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony

or evidence or the guilt or innocence of the accused, nor should counsel

make arguments calculated to inflame passions or prejudices. In argument

counsel may treat the testimony of witnesses as conclusively establishing

the facts related by the witnesses. Counsel may not cite legal authorities

or the facts of other cases when arguing to members on findings.

  Trial

counsel may not comment on the accused's exercise of the right against self-incrimination

 or the right to counsel. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 512. Trial counsel

 may not argue that the prosecution's evidence is unrebutted if the only

rebuttal could come from the accused. When the accused is on trial for several

offenses and testifies only as to some of the offenses, trial counsel may

not comment on the accused's failure to testify as to the others. When the

accused testifies on the merits regarding an offense charged, trial counsel

may comment on the accused's failure in that testimony to deny or explain

specific incriminating facts that the evidence for the prosecution tends

to establish regarding that offense.

  Trial counsel may

not comment on the failure of the defense to call witnesses or of the accused

to testify at the Article 32 preliminary hearing or upon the probable effect of

the court-martial's findings on relations between the military and civilian

communities.

  The rebuttal argument of trial counsel is generally

limited to matters argued by the defense. If trial counsel is permitted

to introduce new matter in closing argument, the defense should be allowed

 to reply in rebuttal. However, this will not preclude trial counsel from

 presenting a final argument.

### (c) Waiver of objection to improper argument.

Failure to object to improper argument before the military judge

 begins to instruct the members on findings shall constitute waiver of the

objection.

#### Discussion

If an objection that an argument is improper is sustained, the

military judge should immediately instruct the members that the argument

was improper and that they must disregard it. In extraordinary cases improper

argument may require a mistrial. _See_ R.C.M. 915. The military

judge should be alert to improper argument and take appropriate action when

necessary.

## Rule 920. Instructions on findings

### (a) In general.

The military judge shall give the members appropriate instructions

on findings.

#### Discussion

Instructions consist of a statement of the issues in the case and

an explanation of the legal standards and procedural requirements by which

the members will determine findings. Instructions should be tailored to

fit the circumstances of the case, and should fairly and adequately cover

the issues presented.

### (b) When given.

Instructions on findings shall be given before or after arguments

by counsel, or at both times, and before the members close to deliberate

on findings, but the military judge may, upon request of the members, any

party, or _sua sponte_, give additional instructions at a

later time.

#### Discussion

After members have reached a finding on a specification, instructions

 may not be given on an offense included therein which was not described

in an earlier instruction unless the finding is illegal. This is true even

if the finding has not been announced. When instructions are to be given

is a matter within the sole discretion of the military trial judge.

### (c) Requests for instructions.

At the close of the evidence or at such other time as the military

 judge may permit, any party may request that the military judge instruct

the members on the law as set forth in the request. The military judge may

require the requested instruction to be written. Each party shall be given

the opportunity to be heard on any proposed instruction on findings before

it is given. The military judge shall inform the parties of the proposed

action on such requests before their closing arguments.

#### Discussion

Requests for and objections to instructions should be resolved at

an Article 39(a) session. _But see_ R.C.M 801(e)(3); 803.

  If

an issue has been raised, ordinarily the military judge must instruct on

the issue when requested to do so. The military judge is not required to

give the specific instruction requested by counsel, however, as long as

the issue is adequately covered in the instructions.

  The

military judge should not identify the source of any instruction when addressing

the members.

  All written requests for instructions should

be marked as appellate exhibits, whether or not they are given.

### (d) How given.

Instructions on findings shall be given orally on the record in

the presence of all parties and the members. Written copies of the instructions,

or, unless a party objects, portions of them, may also be given to the members

for their use during deliberations.

#### Discussion

A copy of any written instructions delivered to the members should

be marked as an appellate exhibit.

### (e) Required instructions.

Instructions on findings shall include:

(1) A description of the elements of each offense charged, unless findings

on such offenses are unnecessary because they have been entered pursuant

to a plea of guilty;

(2) A description of the elements of each lesser included offense in

 issue, unless trial of a lesser included offense is barred by the statute

of limitations (Article 43) and the accused refuses to waive the bar;

(3) A description of any special defense under R.C.M. 916 in issue;

(4) A direction that only matters properly before the court-martial

may be considered;

(5) A charge that-

(A) The accused must be presumed to be innocent until the accused's

guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;

(B) In the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as

to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the

accused and the accused must be acquitted;

(C) If, when a lesser included offense is in issue, there is a reasonable

 doubt as to the degree of guilt of the accused, the finding must be in a

lower degree as to which there is not reasonable doubt; and

(D) The burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused is upon the Government. [When the issue of lack of mental responsibility is raised, add: The burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence is upon the accused. When the issue of mistake of fact under R.C.M. 916(j)(2) is raised, add: The accused has the burden of proving the defense of mistake of fact as to age by a preponderance of the evidence.]

(6) Directions on the procedures under R.C.M. 921 for deliberations

and voting; and

(7) Such other explanations, descriptions, or directions as may be

necessary and which are properly requested by a party or which the military

judge determines, _sua sponte_, should be given.

##### Discussion

A matter is "in issue" when some evidence, without regard

 to its source or credibility, has been admitted upon which members might

rely if they choose. An instruction on a lesser included offense is proper

when an element from the charged offense which distinguishes thatoffense

from the lesser offense is in dispute.

  _See_ R.C.M.

918(c) and discussion as to reasonable doubt and other matters relating

to the basis for findings which may be the subject of an instruction.

  Other

matters which may be the subject of instruction in appropriate cases included:

inferences (_see_ the explanations in Part IV concerning inferences

 relating to specific offenses); the limited purpose for which evidence was

admitted (regardless of whether such evidence was offered by the prosecution

of defense) (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 105); the effect of character

evidence (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 404; 405); the effect of judicial

notice (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 201, 201A); the weight to be

given a pretrial statement (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 340(e)); the

effect of stipulations (_see_ R.C.M. 811); that, when a guilty

plea to a lesser included offense has been accepted, the members should

accept as proved the matters admitted by the plea, but must determine whether

 the remaining elements are established; that a plea of guilty to one offense

 may not be the basis for inferring the existence of a fact or element of

another offense; the absence of the accused from trial should not be held

 against the accused; and that no adverse inferences may be drawn from an

 accused's failure to testify (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 301(g)).

  The

military judge may summarize and comment upon evidence in the case in instructions.

 In doing so, the military judge should present an accurate, fair, and dispassionate

statement of what the evidence shows; not depart from an impartial role;

not assume as true the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue when

the evidence is conflicting or disputed, or when there is no evidence to

support the matter; and make clear that the members must exercise their independent

judgment as to the facts.

### (f) Waiver.

Failure to object to an instruction or to omission of an instruction

 before the members close to deliberate constitutes waiver of the objection

in the absence of plain error. The military judge may require the party

objecting to specify of what respect the instructions given were improper.

The parties shall be given the opportunity to be heard on any objection outside

the presence of the members.

## Rule 921. Deliberations and voting on findings

### (a) In general.

After the military judge instructs the members on findings, the

 members shall deliberate and vote in a closed session. Only the members

shall be present during deliberations and voting. Superiority in rank shall

not be used in any manner in an attempt to control the independence of members

in the exercise of their judgment.

### (b) Deliberations.

Deliberations properly include full and free discussion of the merits

 of the case. Unless otherwise directed by the military judge, members may

take with them in deliberations their notes, if any, any exhibits admitted

in evidence, and any written instructions. Members may request that the court-martial

be reopened and that portions of the record be read to them or additional

evidence introduced. The military judge may, in the exercise of discretion,

grant such request.

### (c) Voting.

#### (1) Secret ballot.

 Voting on the findings for each charge and specification shall

be by secret written ballot. All members present shall vote.

#### (2) Numbers of votes required to convict.

##### (A) Death penalty mandatory.

A finding of guilty of an offense for which the death penalty is

 mandatory results only if all members present vote for a finding of guilty.

###### Discussion

Article 106 is the only offense under the code for which the death

 penalty is mandatory.

##### (B) Other offenses.

As to any offense for which the death penalty is not mandatory,

a finding of guilty results only if at least two-thirds of the members present

vote for a finding of guilty.

###### Discussion

In computing the number of votes required to convict, any fraction

of a vote is rounded up to the next whole number. For example, if there

are five members, the concurrence of at least four would be required to convict.

 The military judge should instruct the members on the specific number of

votes required to convict.

#### (3) Acquittal.

If fewer than two-thirds of the members present vote for a finding

of guilty-or, when the death penalty is mandatory, if fewer than all

the members present vote for a finding of guilty-a finding of not

guilty has resulted as to the charge or specification on which the vote was

taken.

#### (4) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.

When the defense of lack of mental responsibility is in issue under

 R.C.M. 916(k)(1), the members shall first vote on whether the prosecution

has proven the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. If at

least two-thirds of the members present (all members for offenses where the

death penalty is mandatory) vote for a finding of guilty, then the members

shall vote on whether the accused has proven lack of mental responsibility.

If a majority of the members present concur that the accused has proven lack

of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence, a finding of not

guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility results. If the vote

on lack of mental responsibility does not result in a finding of not guilty

only by reason of lack of mental responsibility, then the defense of lack

of mental responsibility has been rejected and the finding of guilty stands.

##### Discussion

If lack of mental responsibility is in issue with regard to more

than one specification, the members should determine the issue of lack of

mental responsibility on each specification separately.

#### (5) Included offenses.

Members shall not vote on a lesser included offense unless a finding

 of not guilty of the offense charged has been reached. If a finding of not

guilty of an offense charged has been reached the members shall vote on

each included offense on which they have been instructed, in order of severity

beginning with the most severe. The members shall continue the vote on each

included offense on which they have been instructed until a finding of guilty

results or findings of not guilty have been reached as to each such offense.

#### (6) Procedure for voting.

##### (A) Order.

Each specification shall be voted on separately before the corresponding

charge. The order of voting on several specifications under a charge or on

several charges shall be determined by the president unless a majority of

the members object.

##### (B) Counting votes.

The junior member shall collect the ballots and count the votes.

The president shall check the count and inform the other members of the

result.

###### Discussion

Once findings have been reached, they may be reconsidered only in

 accordance with R.C.M. 924.

### (d) Action after findings are reached.

After the members have reached findings on each charge and specification

before them, the court-martial shall be opened and the president shall inform

the military judge that findings have been reached. The military judge may,

in the presence of the parties, examine any writing which the president intends

to read to announce the findings and may assist the members in putting the

 findings in proper form. Neither that writing nor any oral or written clarification

or discussion concerning it shall constitute announcement of the findings.

#### Discussion

Ordinarily a findings worksheet should be provided to the members

as an aid to putting the findings in proper form. _See_ Appendix

10 for a format for findings. If the military judge examines any writing

by the members or otherwise assists them to put findings in proper form,

this must be done in an open session and counsel should be given the opportunity

to examine such a writing and to be heard on any instructions the military

judge may give. _See_ Article 39(b).

  The

president should not disclose any specific number of votes for or against

any finding.

## Rule 922. Announcement of findings

### (a) In general.

Findings shall be announced in the presence of all parties promptly

 after they have been determined.

#### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 10. A finding of an offense about

which no instructions were given is not proper.

### (b) Findings by members.

The president shall announce the findings by the members.

(1) If a finding is based on a plea of guilty, the president shall so

 state.

(2) In a capital case, if a finding of guilty is unanimous with respect

 to a capital offense, the president shall so state. This provision shall

not apply during reconsideration under R.C.M. 924(a) of a finding of guilty

previously announced in open court unless the prior finding was announced

as unanimous.

##### Discussion

If the findings announced are ambiguous, the military judge should

 seek clarification. _See also_ R.C.M. 924. A nonunanimous

finding of guilty as to a capital offense may be reconsidered, but not for

the purpose of rendering a unanimous verdict in order to authorize a capital

sentencing proceeding. The president shall not make a statement regarding

unanimity with respect to reconsideration of findings as to an offense in

which the prior findings were not unanimous.

### (c) Findings by military judge.

The military judge shall announce the findings when trial is by

 military judge alone or when findings may be entered upon R.C.M. 910(g).

### (d) Erroneous announcement.

If an error was made in the announcement of the findings of the

 court-martial, the error may be corrected by a new announcement in accordance

with this rule. The error must be discovered and the new announcement made

before the final adjournment of the court-martial in the case.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1102 concerning the action to be taken

if the error in the announcement is discovered after final adjournment.

### (e) Polling prohibited.

Except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 606, members may not be questioned

about their deliberations and voting.

## Rule 923. Impeachment of findings

Findings which are proper on their face may be impeached only when

 extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the attention

of a member, outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member,

or unlawful command influence was brought to bear upon any member.

### Discussion

Deliberations of the members ordinarily are not subject to disclosure. _

See_ Mil. R. Evid. 606. Unsound reasoning by a member, misconception

of the evidence, or misapplication of the law is not a proper basis for

challenging the findings. However, when a showing of a ground for impeaching

the verdict has been made, members may be questioned about such a ground.

The military judge determines, as an interlocutory matter, whether such

an inquiry will be conducted and whether a finding has been impeached.

## Rule 924. Reconsideration of findings

### (a) Time for reconsideration.

Members may reconsider any finding reached by them before such

finding is announced in open session.

### (b) Procedure.

Any member may propose that a finding be reconsidered. If such a

 proposal is made in a timely manner the question whether to reconsider shall

be determined in closed session by secret written ballot. Any finding of

not guilty shall be reconsidered if a majority vote for reconsideration.

Any finding of guilty shall be reconsidered if more than one-third of the

members vote for reconsideration. When the death penalty is mandatory, a

request by any member for reconsideration of a guilty finding requires reconsideration.

Any finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility

shall be reconsidered on the issue of the finding of guilty of the elements

if more than one-third of the members vote for reconsideration, and on the

issue of mental responsibility if a majority vote for reconsideration. If

a vote to reconsider a finding succeeds, the procedures in R.C.M. 921 shall

apply.

#### Discussion

After the initial secret ballot vote on a finding in closed session,

 no other vote may be taken on that finding unless a vote to reconsider succeeds.

### (c) Military judge sitting alone.

In trial by military judge alone, the military judge may reconsider

 any finding of guilty at any time before announcement of sentence and may

reconsider the issue of the finding of guilty of the elements in a finding

of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility at any time

before announcement of sentence or authentication of the record of trial

in the case of a complete acquittal.

# CHAPTER X. SENTENCING

## Rule 1001. Presentencing procedure

### (a) In general.

#### (1) Procedure.

After findings of guilty have been announced, the prosecution and

 defense may present matter pursuant to this rule to aid the court-martial

in determining an appropriate sentence. Such matter shall ordinarily be

presented in the following sequence-

(A) Presentation by trial counsel of:

(i) service data relating to the accused taken from the charge sheet;

(ii) personal data relating to the accused and of the character of the

 accused's prior service as reflected in the personnel records of the accused;

(iii) evidence of prior convictions, military or civilian;

(iv) evidence of aggravation; and

(v) evidence of rehabilitative potential.

(B) Victim's right to be reasonably heard. _See_ R.C.M. 1001A.

(C) Presentation by the defense of evidence in extenuation or mitigation or both.

(D) Rebuttal.

(E) Argument by trial counsel on sentence.

(F) Argument by defense counsel on sentence.

(G) Rebuttal arguments in the discretion of the military judge.

#### (2) Adjudging sentence.

A sentence shall be adjudged in all cases without unreasonable

delay.

#### (3) Advice and inquiry.

The military judge shall personally inform the accused of the right

 to present matters in extenuation and mitigation, including the right to

make a sworn or unsworn statement or to remain silent, and shall ask whether

the accused chooses to exercise those rights.

### (b) Matter to be presented by the prosecution.

#### (1) Service data from the charge sheet.

Trial counsel shall inform the court-martial of the data on the

 charge sheet relating to the pay and service of the accused and the duration

and nature of any pretrial restraint. In the discretion of the military

judge, this may be done by reading the material from the charge sheet or

by giving the court-martial a written statement of such matter. If the defense

objects to the data as being materially inaccurate or incomplete, or containing

specified objectionable matter, the military judge shall determine the issue.

 Objections not asserted are waived.

#### (2) Personal data and character of prior service of the accused.

Under regulations of the Secretary concerned, trial counsel may

 obtain and introduce from the personnel records of the accused evidence of

the accused's marital status; number of dependents, if any; and character

of prior service. Such evidence includes copies of reports reflecting the

past military efficiency, conduct, performance, and history of the accused

and evidence of any disciplinary actions including punishments under Article

15.

 "Personnel records of the accused" includes any

 records made or maintained in accordance with departmental regulations that

reflect the past military efficiency, conduct, performance, and history

of the accused. If the accused objects to a particular document as inaccurate

or incomplete in a specified respect, or as containing matter that is not

admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence, the matter shall be determined

by the military judge. Objections not asserted are waived.

#### (3) Evidence of prior convictions of the accused.

##### (A) In general.

The trial counsel may introduce evidence of military or civilian

 convictions of the accused. For purposes of this rule, there is a "conviction"

in a court-martial case when a sentence has been adjudged. In a civilian

case, a "conviction" includes any disposition following an initial

judicial determination or assumption of guilt, such as when guilt has been

established by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, regardless

of the subsequent disposition, sentencing procedure, or final judgment. However,

a "civilian conviction" does not include a diversion from the

 judicial process without a finding or admission of guilt; expunged convictions;

juvenile adjudications; minor traffic violations; foreign convictions; tribal

court convictions; or convictions reversed, vacated, invalidated or pardoned

because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating

the accused.

###### Discussion

A vacation of a suspended sentence (_see_ R.C.M.

1109) is not a conviction and is not admissible as such, but may be admissible

under subsection (b)(2) of this rule as reflective of the character of the

prior service of the accused.

  Whether a civilian conviction

is admissible is left to the discretion of the military judge. As stated

in the rule, a civilian "conviction" includes any disposition

following an initial judicial determination or assumption of guilt regardless

of the sentencing procedure and the final judgment following probation or

other sentence. Therefore, convictions may be admissible regardless of whether

a court ultimately suspended judgment upon discharge of the accused following

probation, permitted withdrawal of the guilty plea, or applies some other

form of alternative sentencing. Additionally, the term "conviction"

need not be taken to mean a final judgment of conviction and sentence.

##### (B) Pendency of appeal.

The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of

a conviction inadmissible except that a conviction by summary court-martial

or special court-martial without a military judge may not be used for purposes

of this rule until review has been completed pursuant to Article 64 or Article

66, if applicable. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.

##### (C) Method of proof.

Previous convictions may be proved by any evidence admissible under

 the Military Rules of Evidence.

###### Discussion

Normally, previous convictions may be proved by use of the personnel

 records of the accused, by the record of the conviction, or by the order

 promulgating the result of trial. _See_ DD Form 493 (Extract

of Military Records of Previous Convictions).

#### (4) Evidence in aggravation.

The trial counsel may present evidence as to any aggravating circumstances

directly relating to or resulting from the offenses of which the accused

has been found guilty. Evidence in aggravation includes, but is not limited

to, evidence of financial, social, psychological, and medical impact on or

cost to any person or entity who was the victim of an offense committed by

the accused and evidence of significant adverse impact on the mission, discipline,

or efficiency of the command directly and immediately resulting from the

accused's offense. In addition, evidence in aggravation may include evidence

that the accused intentionally selected any victim or any property as the

object of the offense because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion,

national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation of

any person. Except in capital cases a written or oral deposition taken in

accordance with R.C.M. 702 is admissible in aggravation.

##### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 1004 concerning aggravating circumstances

in capital cases.

#### (5) Evidence of rehabilitative potential.

Rehabilitative potential refers to the accused's potential to be

 restored, through vocational, correctional, or therapeutic training or other

 corrective measures to a useful and constructive place in society.

##### (A) In general.

The trial counsel may present, by testimony or oral deposition in

 accordance with R.C.M. 702(g)(1), evidence in the form of opinions concerning

 the accused's previous performance as a servicemember and potential for

rehabilitation.

##### (B) Foundation for opinion.

The witness or deponent providing opinion evidence regarding the

 accused's rehabilitative potential must possess sufficient information and

 knowledge about the accused to offer a rationally-based opinion that is

helpful to the sentencing authority. Relevant information and knowledge

include, but are not limited to, information and knowledge about the accused's

 character, performance of duty, moral fiber, determination to be rehabilitated,

 and nature and severity of the offense or offenses.

###### Discussion

_See generally_ Mil. R. Evid. 701, Opinion testimony

 by lay witnesses. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 703, Bases of

opinion testimony by experts, if the witness or deponent is testifying as

an expert. The types of information and knowledge reflected in this subparagraph

are illustrative only.

##### (C) Bases for opinion.

An opinion regarding the accused's rehabilitative potential must

be based upon relevant information and knowledge possessed by the witness

or deponent, and must relate to the accused's personal circumstances. The

opinion of the witness or deponent regarding the severity or nature of the

accused's offense or offenses may not serve as the principal basis for an

opinion of the accused's rehabilitative potential.

##### (D) Scope of opinion.

An opinion offered under this rule is limited to whether the accused

 has rehabilitative potential and to the magnitude or quality of any such

 potential. A witness may not offer an opinion regarding the appropriateness

of a punitive discharge or whether the accused should be returned to the

accused's unit.

###### Discussion

On direct examination, a witness or deponent may respond affirmatively

or negatively regarding whether the accused has rehabilitative potential.

 The witness or deponent may also opine succinctly regarding the magnitude

or quality of the accused rehabilitative potential; for example, the witness

or deponent may opine that the accused has "great" or "little"

rehabilitative potential. The witness or deponent, however, generally may

not further elaborate on the accused's rehabilitative potential, such as

describing the particular reasons for forming the opinion.

##### (E) Cross-examination.

On cross-examination, inquiry is permitted into relevant and specific

 instances of conduct.

##### (F) Redirect.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this rule, the scope of

opinion testimony permitted on redirect may be expanded, depending upon the

nature and scope of the cross-examination.

###### Discussion

For example, on redirect a witness or deponent may testify regarding

 specific instances of conduct when the cross-examination of the witness or

 deponent concerned specific instances of misconduct. Similarly, for example,

 on redirect a witness or deponent may offer an opinion on matters beyond

the scope of the accused's rehabilitative potential if an opinion about such

 matters was elicited during cross-examination of the witness or deponent

and is otherwise admissible.

### (c) Matter to be presented by the defense.

#### (1) In general.

The defense may present matters in rebuttal of any material presented

by the prosecution and may present matters in extenuation and mitigation

regardless whether the defense offered evidence before findings.

##### (A) Matter in extenuation.

Matter in extenuation of an offense serves to explain the circumstances

surrounding the commission of an offense, including those reasons for committing

the offense which do not constitute a legal justification or excuse.

##### (B) Matter in mitigation.

Matter in mitigation of an offense is introduced to lessen the

punishment to be adjudged by the court-martial, or to furnish grounds for

a recommendation of clemency. It includes the fact that nonjudicial punishment

 under Article 15 has been imposed for an offense growing out of the same

act or omission that constitutes the offense of which the accused has been

found guilty, particular acts of good conduct or bravery and evidence of

the reputation or record of the accused in the service for efficiency, fidelity,

subordination, temperance, courage, or any other trait that is desirable

in a servicemember.

#### (2) Statement by the accused.

##### (A) In general.

The accused may testify, make an unsworn statement, or both in

extenuation, in mitigation or to rebut matters presented by the prosecution,

or for all three purposes whether or not the accused testified prior to findings.

 The accused may limit such testimony or statement to any one or more of the

 specifications of which the accused has been found guilty. This subsection

does not permit the filing of an affidavit of the accused.

##### (B) Testimony of the accused.

The accused may give sworn oral testimony under this paragraph and

 shall be subject to cross-examination concerning it by the trial counsel

or examination on it by the court-martial, or both.

##### (C) Unsworn statement.

The accused may make an unsworn statement and may not be cross-examined

by the trial counsel upon it or examined upon it by the court-martial. The

prosecution may, however, rebut any statements of facts therein. The unsworn

statement may be oral, written, or both, and may be made by the accused,

by counsel, or both.

###### Discussion

An unsworn statement ordinarily should not include what is properly

 argument, but inclusion of such matter by the accused when personally making

an oral statement normally should not be grounds for stopping the statement.

#### (3) Rules of evidence relaxed.

The military judge may, with respect to matters in extenuation or

 mitigation or both, relax the rules of evidence. This may include admitting

 letters, affidavits, certificates of military and civil officers, and other

writings of similar authenticity and reliability.

### (d) Rebuttal and surrebuttal.

The prosecution may rebut matters presented by the defense. The

 defense in surrebuttal may then rebut any rebuttal offered by the prosecution.

 Rebuttal and surrebuttal may continue, in the discretion of the military

judge. If the Military Rules of Evidence were relaxed under subsection (c)(3)

of this rule, they may be relaxed during rebuttal and surrebuttal to the

same degree.

### (e) Production of witnesses.

#### (1) In general.

During the presentence proceedings, there shall be much greater

 latitude than on the merits to receive information by means other than testimony

presented through the personal appearance of witnesses. Whether a witness

shall be produced to testify during presentence proceedings is a matter within

the discretion of the military judge, subject to the limitations in subsection

(e)(2) of this rule.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 703 concerning the procedures for production

of witnesses.

#### (2) Limitations.

A witness may be produced to testify during presentence proceedings

 through a subpoena or travel orders at Government expense only if-

(A) The testimony expected to be offered by the witness is necessary

for consideration of a matter of substantial significance to a determination

of an appropriate sentence, including evidence necessary to resolve an alleged

inaccuracy or dispute as to a material fact;

(B) The weight or credibility of the testimony is of substantial significance

to the determination of an appropriate sentence;

(C) The other party refuses to enter into a stipulation of fact containing

the matters to which the witness is expected to testify, except in an extraordinary

case when such a stipulation of fact would be an insufficient substitute

for the testimony;

(D) Other forms of evidence, such as oral depositions, written interrogatories,

former testimony, or testimony by remote means would not be sufficient to meet the needs of the court-martial

in the determination of an appropriate sentence; and

(E) The significance of the personal appearance of the witness to the

 determination of an appropriate sentence, when balanced against the practical

difficulties of producing the witness, favors production of the witness.

Factors to be considered include the costs of producing the witness, the

timing of the request for production of the witness, the potential delay

in the presentencing proceeding that may be caused by the production of

the witness, and the likelihood of significant interference with military

operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.

###### Discussion

The procedures for receiving testimony via remote means and the definition thereof are contained in R.C.M. 914B.

### (f) Additional matters to be considered.

In addition to matters introduced under this rule, the court-martial

 may consider-

(1) That a plea of guilty is a mitigating factor; and

(2) Any evidence properly introduced on the merits before findings,

 including:

(A) Evidence of other offenses or acts of misconduct even if introduced

 for a limited purpose; and

(B) Evidence relating to any mental impairment or deficiency of the

 accused.

###### Discussion

The fact that the accused is of low intelligence or that, because

of a mental or neurological condition the accused's ability to adhere to

the right is diminished, may be extenuating. On the other hand, in determining

the severity of a sentence, the court-martial may consider evidence tending

to show that an accused has little regard for the rights of others.

### (g) Argument.

After introduction of matters relating to sentence under this rule,

 counsel for the prosecution and defense may argue for an appropriate sentence.

Trial counsel may not in argument purport to speak for the convening authority

or any higher authority, or refer to the views of such authorities or any

policy directive relative to punishment or to any punishment or quantum of

punishment greater than that court-martial may adjudge. Trial counsel may,

however, recommend a specific lawful sentence and may also refer to generally

accepted sentencing philosophies, including rehabilitation of the accused,

general deterrence, specific deterrence of misconduct by the accused, and

social retribution. Failure to object to improper argument before the military

judge begins to instruct the members on sentencing shall constitute waiver

of the objection.

#### Discussion

 A victim, victims' counsel, or designee has no right to present argument under this rule.

## Rule 1001A. Crime victims and presentencing

### (a) In general.

A crime victim of an offense of which the accused has been found guilty has the right to be reasonably heard at a sentencing hearing relating to that offense. A victim under this rule is not considered a witness for purposes of Article 42(b). Trial counsel shall ensure the victim is aware of the opportunity to exercise that right. If the victim exercises the right to be reasonably heard, the victim shall be called by the court. This right is independent of whether the victim testified during findings or is called to testify under R.C.M. 1001.

### (b) Definitions.

#### (1) Crime victim.

 For purposes of this rule, a "crime victim" is an individual who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense of which the accused was found guilty.

#### (2) Victim Impact.

 For the purposes of this rule, "victim impact" includes any financial, social, psychological, or medical impact on the victim directly relating to or arising from the offense of which the accused has been found guilty.

#### (3) Mitigation.

 For the purposes of this rule, "mitigation" includes a matter to lessen the punishment to be adjudged by the court-martial or to furnish grounds for a recommendation of clemency.

#### (4) Right to be reasonably heard.

##### (A) Capital cases.

 In capital cases, for purposes of this rule, the "right to be reasonably heard" means the right to make a sworn statement.

##### (B) Non-capital cases.

 In non-capital cases, for purposes of this rule, the "right to be reasonably heard" means the right to make a sworn or unsworn statement.

### (c) Content of statement.

 The content of statements made under subsections (d) and (e) of this rule may include victim impact or matters in mitigation.

### (d) Sworn statement.

 The victim may give a sworn statement under this rule and shall be subject to cross-examination concerning it by the trial counsel or defense counsel or examination on it by the court-martial, or all or any of the three. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the sworn statement may be made by the victim's designee appointed under R.C.M. 801(a)(6). Additionally, a victim under 18 years of age may elect to make a sworn statement.

### (e) Unsworn statement.

 The victim may make an unsworn statement and may not be cross-examined by the trial counsel or defense counsel upon it or examined upon it by the court-martial. The prosecution or defense may, however, rebut any statements of facts therein. The unsworn statement may be oral, written, or both. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the unsworn statement may be made by the victim's designee appointed under R.C.M. 801(a)(6). Additionally, a victim under 18 years of age may elect to make an unsworn statement.

#### (1) Procedure for presenting unsworn statement.

 After the announcement of findings, a victim who would like to present an unsworn statement shall provide a copy to the trial counsel, defense counsel, and military judge. The military judge may waive this requirement for good cause shown.

##### Discussion

 When the military judge waives the notice requirement under this rule, the military judge may conduct a session under Article 39(a) to ascertain the content of the victim's anticipated unsworn statement.

(2) Upon good cause shown, the military judge may permit the victim's counsel to deliver all or part of the victim's unsworn statement.

##### Discussion

 If there are numerous victims, the military judge may reasonably limit the form of the statements provided.

 A victim's unsworn statement should not exceed what is permitted under R.C.M. 1001A(c) and may not include a recommendation of a specific sentence. Upon objection by either party or _sua sponte_, a military judge may stop or interrupt a victim's unsworn statement that includes matters outside the scope of R.C.M. 1001A(c). A victim, victim's counsel, or designee has no separate right to present argument under R.C.M. 1001(g).

## Rule 1002. Sentence determination

Subject to limitations in this Manual, the sentence to be adjudged

is a matter within the discretion of the court-martial; except when a mandatory

minimum sentence is prescribed by the code, a court-martial may adjudge

any punishment authorized in this Manual, including the maximum punishment

or any lesser punishment, or may adjudge a sentence of no punishment.

### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning authorized punishments

and limitations on punishments. _See also_ R.C.M. 1004 in

capital cases.

## Rule 1003. Punishments

### (a) In general.

Subject to the limitations in this Manual, the punishments authorized

 in this rule may be adjudged in the case of any person found guilty of an

offense by a court-martial.

#### Discussion

"Any person" includes officers, enlisted persons, person

 in custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposed by a court-martial,

and, insofar as the punishments are applicable, any other person subject

to the code. _See_ R.C.M. 202.

### (b) Authorized punishments.

Subject to the limitations in this Manual, a court-martial may

adjudge only the following punishments:

#### (1) Reprimand.

A court-martial shall not specify the terms or wording of a reprimand.

A reprimand, if approved, shall be issued, in writing, by the convening authority;

##### Discussion

A reprimand adjudged by a court-martial is a punitive censure.

#### (2) Forfeiture of pay and allowances.

Unless a total forfeiture is adjudged, a sentence to forfeiture

shall state the exact amount in whole dollars to be forfeited each month

and the number of months the forfeitures will last.

 Allowances

shall be subject to forfeiture only when the sentence includes forfeiture

of all pay and allowances. The maximum authorized amount of a partial forfeiture

shall be determined by using the basic pay, retired pay, or retainer pay,

as applicable, or, in the case of reserve component personnel on inactive-duty,

compensation for periods of inactive-duty training, authorized by the cumulative

years of service of the accused, and, if no confinement is adjudged, any

sea or hardship duty pay. If the sentence also includes reduction in grade,

expressly or by operation of law, the maximum forfeiture shall be based on

the grade to which the accused is reduced.

##### Discussion

A forfeiture deprives the accused of the amount of pay (and allowances)

specified as it accrues. Forfeitures accrue to the United States.

  Forfeitures

of pay and allowances adjudged as part of a court-martial sentence, or occurring

 by operation of Article 58b are effective 14 days after the sentence is

adjudged or when the sentence is approved by the convening authority, whichever

is earlier.

   "Basic pay" does not include pay

for special qualifications, such as diving pay, or incentive pay such as

flying, parachuting, or duty on board a submarine.

  Forfeiture

of pay and allowances under Article 58b is not a part of the sentence, but

is an administrative result thereof.

  At general courts-martial,

if both a punitive discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the operation

of Article 58b results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances during that

period of confinement. If only confinement is adjudged, then if that confinement

 exceeds six months, the operation of Article 58b results in total forfeiture

of pay and allowances during that period of confinement. If only a punitive

discharge is adjudged, Article 58b has no effect on pay and allowances.

A death sentence results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances.

  At

a special court-martial, if a bad-conduct discharge and confinement are adjudged,

then the operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of

pay only (not allowances) during that period of confinement. If only confinement

is adjudged, and that confinement exceeds six months, then the operation

of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of pay only (not allowances)

during the period of confinement. If only a bad conduct discharge is adjudged,

Article 58b has no effect on pay.

  If the sentence, as approved

by the convening authority or other competent authority, does not result

in forfeitures by the operation of Article 58b, then only adjudged forfeitures

are effective.

   Article 58b has no effect on summary courts-martial.

#### (3) Fine.

Any court-martial may adjudge a fine in lieu of or in addition to forfeitures.  In the case of a member of the armed forces, summary and special courts-martial may not adjudge any fine or combination of fine and forfeitures in excess of the total amount of forfeitures that may be adjudged in that case.  In the case of a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, a summary court-martial may not adjudge a fine in excess of two-thirds of one month of the highest rate of enlisted pay, and a special court-martial may not adjudge a fine in excess of two-thirds of one year of the highest rate of officer pay.  To enforce collection, a fine may be accompanied by a provision in the sentence that, in the event the fine is not paid, the person fined shall, in addition to any period of confinement adjudged, be further confined until a fixed period considered an equivalent punishment to the fine has expired.  The total period of confinement so adjudged shall not exceed the jurisdictional limitations of the court-martial;

##### Discussion

A fine is in the nature of a judgment and, when ordered executed, makes the accused immediately liable to the United States for the entire amount of money specified in the sentence.  A fine normally should not be adjudged against a member of the armed forces unless the accused was unjustly enriched as a result of the offense of which convicted.  In the case of a civilian subject to military law, a fine, rather than a forfeiture, is the proper monetary penalty to be adjudged, regardless of whether unjust enrichment is present.

  _See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(3) concerning imposition of confinement when the

accused fails to pay a fine.

  Where the sentence adjudged

at a special court-martial includes a fine, see R.C.M. 1107(d)(5) for limitations

on convening authority action on the sentence.

#### (4) Reduction in pay grade.

Except as provided in R.C.M. 1301(d), a court-martial may sentence

an enlisted member to be reduced to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade;

##### Discussion

Reduction under Article 58a is not a part of the sentence but is

an administrative result thereof.

#### (5) Restriction to specified limits.

Restriction may be adjudged for no more than 2 months for each month

 of authorized confinement and in no case for more than 2 months. Confinement

and restriction may be adjudged in the same case, but they may not together

exceed the maximum authorized period of confinement, calculating the equivalency

at the rate specified in this subsection;

##### Discussion

Restriction does not exempt the person on whom it is imposed from

any military duty. Restriction and hard labor without confinement may be

adjudged in the same case provided they do not exceed the maximum limits

 for each. _See_ subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii) of this rule. The

 sentence adjudged should specify the limits of the restriction.

#### (6) Hard labor without confinement.

Hard labor without confinement may be adjudged for no more than

1-1/2 months for each month of authorized confinement and in no case for

more than three months. Hard labor without confinement may be adjudged only

 in the cases of enlisted members. The court-martial shall not specify the

hard labor to be performed. Confinement and hard labor without confinement

may be adjudged in the same case, but they may not together exceed the maximum

authorized period of confinement, calculating the equivalency at the rate

specified in this subsection.

##### Discussion

Hard labor without confinement is performed in addition to other

 regular duties and does not excuse or relieve a person from performing regular

duties. Ordinarily, the immediate commander of the accused will designate

 the amount and character of the labor to be performed. Upon completion of

the daily assignment, the accused should be permitted to take leave or liberty

to which entitled.

  _See_ R.C.M. 1301(d) concerning

limitations on hard labor without confinement in summary courts-martial.

#### (7) Confinement.

The place of confinement shall not be designated by the court-martial.

When confinement for life is authorized, it may be with or without eligibility

for parole. A court-martial shall not adjudge a sentence to solitary confinement

or to confinement without hard labor;

##### Discussion

The authority executing a sentence to confinement may require hard

 labor whether or not the words "at hard labor" are included

in the sentence. _See_ Article 58(b). To promote uniformity,

the words "at hard labor" should be omitted in a sentence to

confinement.

#### (8) Punitive separation.

A court-martial may not adjudge an administrative separation from

the service. There are three types of punitive separation.

##### (A) Dismissal.

Dismissal applies only to commissioned officers, commissioned warrant

 officers, cadets, and midshipmen and may be adjudged only by a general court-martial.

Regardless of the maximum punishment specified for an offense in Part IV

of this Manual, a dismissal may be adjudged for any offense of which a commissioned

 officer, commissioned warrant officer, cadet, or midshipman has been found

 guilty;

##### (B) Dishonorable discharge.

A dishonorable discharge applies only to enlisted persons and warrant

 officers who are not commissioned and may be adjudged only by a general

court-martial. Regardless of the maximum punishment specified for an offense

in Part IV of this Manual, a dishonorable discharge may be adjudged for any

offense of which a warrant officer who is not commissioned has been found

guilty. A dishonorable discharge should be reserved for those who should

be separated under conditions of dishonor, after having been convicted of

offenses usually recognized in civilian jurisdictions as felonies, or of

offenses of a military nature requiring severe punishment; and

###### Discussion

 _See also_ subsection (d)(1) of this rule regarding

when a dishonorable discharge is authorized as an additional punishment.

  _

See_ Article 56a.

##### (C) Bad conduct discharge.

A bad-conduct discharge applies only to enlisted persons and may

be adjudged by a general court-martial and by a special court-martial which

has met the requirements of R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B). A bad-conduct discharge

is less severe than a dishonorable discharge and is designed as a punishment

for bad-conduct rather than as a punishment for serious offenses of either

a civilian or military nature. It is also appropriate for an accused who

has been convicted repeatedly of minor offenses and whose punitive separation

 appears to be necessary;

###### Discussion

 _See also_ subsections (d)(2) and (3) of this rule

regarding when a bad-conduct discharge is authorized as an additional punishment.

#### (9) Death.

Death may be adjudged only in accordance with R.C.M. 1004; and

#### (10) Punishments under the law of war.

In cases tried under the law of war, a general court-martial may

 adjudge any punishment not prohibited by the law of war.

### (c) Limits on punishments.

#### (1) Based on offenses.

##### (A) Offenses listed in Part IV.

###### (i) Maximum punishment.

The maximum limits for the authorized punishments of confinement,

 forfeitures and punitive discharge (if any) are set forth for each offense

listed in Part IV of this Manual. These limitations are for each separate

 offense, not for each charge. When a dishonorable discharge is authorized,

a bad-conduct discharge is also authorized.

###### (ii) Other punishments.

Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Manual, the types

 of punishments listed in subsections (b)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7)

of this rule may be adjudged in addition to or instead of confinement, forfeitures,

a punitive discharge (if authorized), and death (if authorized).

##### (B) Offenses not listed Part IV.

###### (i) Included or related offenses.

For an offense not listed in Part IV of this Manual which is included

 in or closely related to an offense listed therein the maximum punishment

shall be that of the offense listed; however if an offense not listed is

included in a listed offense, and is closely related to another or is equally

closely related to two or more listed offenses, the maximum punishment shall

be the same as the least severe of the listed offenses.

###### (ii) Not included or related offenses.

An offense not listed in Part IV and not included in or closely

 related to any offense listed therein is punishable as authorized by the

United States Code, or as authorized by the custom of the service. When the

 United States Code provides for confinement for a specified period or not

more than a specified period the maximum punishment by court-martial shall

include confinement for that period. If the period is 1 year or longer, the

 maximum punishment by court-martial also includes a dishonorable discharge

and forfeiture of all pay and allowances; if 6 months or more, a bad-conduct

discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances; if less than 6 months,

 forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for the authorized period of confinement.

##### (C) Multiple Offenses.

When the accused is found guilty of two or more offenses, the maximum authorized punishment may be imposed for each separate offense, unless the military judge finds that the offenses are either multiplicious or unreasonably multiplied.

###### (i) Multiplicity.

 A charge is multiplicious and must be dismissed if the proof of such charge also proves every element of another charged offense unless Congress intended to impose multiple punishments for the same act.

###### (ii) Unreasonable Multiplication.

 If the military judge finds that there is an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence, the maximum punishment for those offenses shall be the maximum authorized punishment for the offense carrying the greatest maximum punishment. The military judge may either merge the offenses for sentencing, or dismiss one or more of the charges.

####### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12); 907(b)(3)(B).

  Even if charges are not multiplicious, a military judge may rule on a motion that the prosecutor abused his discretion under R.C.M. 307(c)(4) or a motion that an unreasonable multiplication of charges requires relief under R.C.M. 1003(b)(1). Rather than the "single impulse"  test  previously  noted  in this Discussion, "[t]he better approach is to allow the military judge, in his or her discretion, to merge the offenses for sentencing purposes..." by determining whether the Quiroz test is fulfilled.

_United States v. Campbell_, 71 M.J. 19 (C.A.A.F. 2012). (citing _United States v. Quiroz_, 55 M.J. 334, 338 (C.A.A.F. 2001).

  Multiplicity is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B). Unreasonable multiplication of charges is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12).

#### (2) Based on rank of accused.

##### (A) Commissioned or warrant officers, cadets, and midshipmen.

(i) A commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet, or midshipman may

not be reduced in grade by any court-martial. However, in time of war or

national emergency the Secretary concerned, or such Under Secretary or Assistant

Secretary as may be designated by the Secretary concerned, may commute a

sentence of dismissal to reduction to any enlisted grade.

(ii) Only a general court-martial may sentence a commissioned or warrant

 officer or a cadet, or midshipman to confinement.

(iii) A commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet or midshipman may not

be sentenced to hard labor without confinement.

(iv) Only a general court-martial, upon conviction of any offense in

 violation of the Code, may sentence a commissioned or warrant officer or

a cadet or midshipman to be separated from the service with a punitive separation.

 In the case of commissioned officers, cadets, midshipmen, and commissioned

 warrant officers, the separation shall be by dismissal. In the case of all

other warrant officers, the separation shall by dishonorable discharge.

##### (B) Enlisted persons.

 _See_ subsection (b)(9) of this rule and R.C.M.

1301(d).

#### (3) Based on reserve status in certain circumstances.

##### (A) Restriction on liberty.

A member of a reserve component whose order to active duty is approved

pursuant to Article 2(d)(5) may be required to serve any adjudged restriction

on liberty during that period of active duty. Other members of a reserve

component ordered to active duty pursuant to Article 2(d)(1) or tried by

summary court-martial while on inactive duty training may not-

(i) by sentenced to confinement; or

(ii) be required to serve a court-martial punishment consisting of any

 other restriction on liberty except during subsequent periods of inactive-duty

training or active duty.

##### (B) Forfeiture.

A sentence to forfeiture of pay of a member not retained on active

 duty after completion of disciplinary proceedings may be collected from

active duty and inactive-duty training pay during subsequent periods of duty.

###### Discussion

For application of this subsection, _see_ R.C.M.

204. At the conclusion of nonjudicial punishment proceedings or final adjournment

of the court-martial, the reserve component member who was ordered to active

duty for the purpose of conducting disciplinary proceedings should be released

from active duty within one working day unless the order to active duty was

approved by the Secretary concerned and confinement or other restriction

on liberty was adjudged. Unserved punishments may be carried over to subsequent

periods of inactive-duty training or active duty.

#### (4) Based on status as a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field.

In the case of a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, no court-martial may adjudge forfeiture of pay and allowances, reduction in pay grade, hard labor without confinement, or a punitive separation.

##### (5) Based on other rules.

The maximum limits on punishments in this rule may be further limited

 by other Rules of Courts-martial.

###### Discussion

The maximum punishment may be limited by: the jurisdictional limits

 of the court-martial (_see _ R.C.M. 201(f) and 1301(d)); the

nature of the proceedings (_see_ R.C.M. 810(d) (sentence

limitations in rehearings, new trials, and other trials)); and by instructions

 by a convening authority (_see_ R.C.M. 601(e)(1)). _

See also_ R.C.M. 1107(d)(4) concerning limits on the maximum punishment

which may be approved depending on the nature of the record.

### (d) Circumstances permitting increased punishments.

#### (1) Three or more convictions.

If an accused is found guilty of an offense or offenses for none

of which a dishonorable discharge is otherwise authorized, proof of three

or more previous convictions adjudged by a court-martial during the year

next preceding the commission of any offense of which the accused stands

convicted shall authorize a dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all

pay and allowances and, if the confinement otherwise authorized is less

than 1 year, confinement for 1 year. In computing the 1-year period preceding

the commission of any offense, periods of unauthorized absence shall be excluded.

For purposes of this subsection, the court-martial convictions must be final.

#### (2) Two or more convictions.

If an accused is found guilty of an offense or offenses for none

of which a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is otherwise authorized,

proof of two or more previous convictions adjudged by a court-martial during

the 3 years next preceding the commission of any offense of which the accused

stands convicted shall authorize a bad-conduct discharge and forfeiture of

all pay and allowances and, if the confinement otherwise authorized is less

than 3 months, confinement for 3 months. In computing the 3 year period preceding

the commission of any offense, periods of unauthorized absence shall be excluded.

 For purposes of this subsection the court-martial convictions must be final.

#### (3) Two or more offenses.

If an accused is found guilty of two or more offenses for none of

 which a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is otherwise authorized, the

fact that the authorized confinement for these offenses totals 6 months

or more shall, in addition, authorize a bad-conduct discharge and forfeiture

of all pay and allowances.

##### Discussion

All of these increased punishments are subject to all other limitations

on punishments set forth elsewhere in this rule. Convictions by summary court-martial

may not be used to increase the maximum punishment under this rule. However

they may be admitted and considered under R.C.M. 1001.

## Rule 1004. Capital cases

### (a) In general.

Death may be adjudged only when:

(1) Death is expressly authorized under Part IV of this Manual for an

 offense of which the accused has been found guilty or is authorized under

the law of war for an offense of which the accused has been found guilty

under the law of war; and

(2) The accused was convicted of such an offense by the concurrence

of all the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote was

taken; and

(3) The requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this rule have been

 met.

### (b) Procedure.

In addition to the provisions in R.C.M. 1001, the following procedures

shall apply in capital cases-

#### (1) Notice.

##### (A) Referral.

The convening authority shall indicate that the case is to be tried as a capital case by including a special instruction in the referral block of the charge sheet. Failure to include this special instruction at the time of the referral shall not bar the convening authority from later adding the required special instruction, provided:

(i) that the convening authority has otherwise complied with the notice requirement of subsection (B); and

(ii) that if the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure to include the special instruction, a continuance or a recess is an adequate remedy.

####### (B) Arraignment.

Before arraignment, trial counsel shall give the defense written

 notice of which aggravating factors under subsection (c) of this rule the

prosecution intends to prove. Failure to provide timely notice under this

 subsection of any aggravating factors under subsection (c) of this rule shall

 not bar later notice and proof of such additional aggravating factors unless

the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure and that a

continuance or a recess is not an adequate remedy.

#### (2) Evidence of aggravating factors.

Trial counsel may present evidence in accordance with R.C.M. 1001(b)(4)

tending to establish one or more of the aggravating factors in subsection

(c) of this rule.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ subsection (b)(5) of this rule.

#### (3) Evidence in extenuation and mitigation.

The accused shall be given broad latitude to present evidence in

 extenuation and mitigation.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1001(c).

#### (4) Necessary findings.

Death may not be adjudged unless-

(A) The members find that at least one of the aggravating factors under

 subsection (c) existed;

(B) Notice of such factor was provided in accordance with paragraph

(1) of this subsection and all members concur in the finding with respect

to such factor; and

(C) All members concur that any extenuating or mitigating circumstances

 are substantially outweighed by any aggravating circumstances admissible

under R.C.M. 1001(b)(4), including the factors under subsection (c) of this

rule.

#### (5) Basis for findings.

The findings in subsection (b)(4) of this rule may be based on

evidence introduced before or after findings under R.C.M. 921, or both.

#### (6) Instructions.

In addition to the instructions required under R.C.M. 1005, the

 military judge shall instruct the members of such aggravating factors under

subsection (c) of this rule as may be in issue in the case, and on the requirements

and procedures under subsections (b)(4), (5), (7), and (8) of this rule.

The military judge shall instruct the members that they must consider all

evidence in extenuation and mitigation before they may adjudge death.

#### (7) Voting.

In closed session, before voting on a sentence, the members shall

 vote by secret written ballot separately on each aggravating factor under

subsection (c) of this rule on which they have been instructed. Death may

not be adjudged unless all members concur in a finding of the existence of

 at least one such aggravating factor. After voting on all the aggravating

factors on which they have been instructed, the members shall vote on a

sentence in accordance with R.C.M. 1006.

#### (8) Announcement.

If death is adjudged, the president shall, in addition to complying

 with R.C.M. 1007, announce which aggravating factors under subsection (c)

of this rule were found by the members.

### (c) Aggravating factors.

Death may be adjudged only if the members find, beyond a reasonable

 doubt, one or more of the following aggravating factors:

(1) That the offense was committed before or in the presence of the

 enemy, except that this factor shall not apply in the case of a violation

of Article 118 or 120;

##### Discussion

 _See_ paragraph 23, Part IV, for a definition of

"before or in the presence of the enemy."

(2) That in committing the offense the accused-

(A) Knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to the national

 security of the United States; or

(B) Knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to a mission,

 system, or function of the United States, provided that this subparagraph

shall apply only if substantial damage to the national security of the United

States would have resulted had the intended damage been effected;

(3) That the offense caused substantial damage to the national security

 of the United States, whether or not the accused intended such damage, except

that this factor shall not apply in case of a violation of Article 118 or

120;

(4) That the offense was committed in such a way or under circumstances

 that the life of one or more persons other than the victim was unlawfully

and substantially endangered, except that this factor shall not apply to

a violation of Articles 104, 106a, or 120;

(5) That the accused committed the offense with the intent to avoid

 hazardous duty;

(6) That, only in the case of a violation of Article 118 or 120, the

 offense was committed in time of war and in territory in which the United

States or an ally of the United States was then an occupying power or in

which the armed forces of the United States were then engaged in active hostilities;

(7) That, only in the case of a violation of Article 118(1):

(A) The accused was serving a sentence of confinement for 30 years or

 more or for life at the time of the murder;

(B) The murder was committed: while the accused was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of any robbery, rape, rape of a child, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, sexual abuse of a child, aggravated arson, forcible sodomy, burglary, kidnapping, mutiny, sedition, or piracy of an aircraft or vessel; or while the accused was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of any offense involving the wrongful distribution, manufacture, or introduction or possession, with intent to distribute, of a controlled substance; or, while the accused was engaged in flight or attempted flight after the commission or attempted commission of any such offense.

(C) The murder was committed for the purpose of receiving money or a

 thing of value;

(D) The accused procured another by means of compulsion, coercion, or

a promise of an advantage, a service, or a thing of value to commit the

murder;

(E) The murder was committed with the intent to avoid or to prevent

 lawful apprehension or effect an escape from custody or confinement;

(F) The victim was the President of the United States, the President-elect,

the Vice President, or, if there was no Vice President, the officer in the

order of succession to the office of President of the United States, the

Vice-President-elect, or any individual who is acting as President under

the Constitution and laws of the United States, any Member of Congress (including

a Delegate to, or Resident Commissioner in, the Congress) or Member-of-Congress

elect, justice or judge of the United States, a chief of state or head of

government (or the political equivalent) of a foreign nation, or a foreign

official (as such term is defined in section 1116(b)(3)(A) of title 18,

United States Code), if the official was on official business at the time

of the offense and was in the United States or in a place described in Mil.

R. Evid.315(c)(2), 315(c)(3);

(G) The accused then knew that the victim was any of the following

persons in the execution of office: a commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned,

or petty officer of the armed services of the United States; a member of

any law enforcement or security activity or agency, military or civilian,

including correctional custody personnel; or any firefighter;

(H) The murder was committed with intent to obstruct justice;

(I) The murder was preceded by the intentional infliction of substantial

 physical harm or prolonged, substantial mental or physical pain and suffering

to the victim. For purposes of this section, "substantial physical

harm" means fractures or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members

of the body, serious damage to internal organs, or other serious bodily injuries.

The term "substantial physical harm" does not mean minor injuries,

such as a black eye or bloody nose.  The term "substantial mental

or physical pain or suffering" is accorded its common meaning and includes

torture.

(J) The accused has been found guilty in the same case of another violation

of Article 118;

(K) The victim of the murder was under 15 years of age.

(8) That only in the case of a violation of Article 118(4), the accused was the actual perpetrator of the killing or was a principal whose participation in the burglary, forcible sodomy, rape, rape of a child, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, sexual abuse of a child, robbery, or aggravated arson was major and who manifested a reckless indifference for human life.

##### Discussion

Conduct amounts to "reckless indifference" when it

evinces a wanton disregard of consequences under circumstances involving

grave danger to the life of another, although no harm is necessarily intended.

 The accused must have had actual knowledge of the grave danger to others

or knowledge of circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to realize

the highly dangerous character of such conduct. In determining whether participation

in the offense was major, the accused's presence at the scene and the extent

to which the accused aided, abetted, assisted, encouraged, or advised the

other participants should be considered. _See United States v. Berg

_, 31 M.J. 38 (C.M.A. 1990); _ United States v. McMonagle

_ 38 M.J. 53 (C.M.A. 1993).

(9) That, in addition to the offense for which the accused is eligible for the death penalty, the accused has also been convicted of a sexual offense in which:

(A) Under Article 120b, the victim was under the age of 12; or

(B) Under Articles 120 or 120b, the accused maimed or attempted to kill the victim;

(10) That, only in the case of a violation of the law of war, death is

 authorized under the law of war for the offense;

(11) That, only in the case of a violation of Article 104 or 106a:

(A) The accused has been convicted of another offense involving espionage

 or treason for which either a sentence of death or imprisonment for life

was authorized by statute; or

(B) That in committing the offense, the accused knowingly created a

grave risk of death to a person other than the individual who was the victim.

 For

purposes of this rule, "national security" means the national

defense and foreign relations of the United States and specifically includes:

a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations;

a favorable foreign relations position; or a defense posture capable of successfully

resisting hostile or destructive action from within or without.

###### Discussion

Examples of substantial damage of the national security of the United

 States include: impeding the performance of a combat mission or operation;

impeding the performance of an important mission in a hostile fire or imminent

danger pay area (_see_ 37 U.S.C. &sect; 310(a)); and disclosing

military plans, capabilities, or intelligence such as to jeopardize any combat

mission or operation of the armed services of the United States or its allies

or to materially aid an enemy of the United States.

### (d) Spying.

If the accused has been found guilty of spying under Article 106,

 subsections (a)(2), (b), and (c) of this rule and R.C.M. 1006 and 1007 shall

not apply. Sentencing proceedings in accordance with R.C.M. 1001 shall be

conducted, but the military judge shall announce that by operation of law

a sentence of death has been adjudged.

### (e) Other penalties.

Except for a violation of Article 106, when death is an authorized

 punishment for an offense, all other punishments authorized under R.C.M.

1003 are also authorized for that offense, including confinement for life,

 with or without eligibility for parole, and may be adjudged in lieu of the

 death penalty, subject to limitations specifically prescribed in this Manual.

A sentence of death includes a dishonorable discharge or dismissal as appropriate.

Confinement is a necessary incident of a sentence of death, but not a part

of it.

#### Discussion

A sentence of death may not be ordered executed until approved by

the President. _See_ R.C.M. 1207. A sentence to death which

has been finally ordered executed will be carried out in the manner prescribed

by the Secretary concerned. _See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(1).

## Rule 1005. Instructions on sentence

### (a) In general.

The military judge shall give the members appropriate instructions

on sentence.

#### Discussion

Instructions should be tailored to the facts and circumstances of

the individual case.

### (b) When given.

Instructions on sentence shall be given after arguments by counsel

 and before the members close to deliberate on sentence, but the military

judge may, upon request of the members, any party, or _sua sponte

_, give additional instructions at a later time.

### (c) Requests for instructions.

After presentation of matters relating to sentence or at such other

 time as the military judge may permit, any party may request that the military

judge instruct the members on the law as set forth in the request. The military

judge may require the requested instruction to be written. Each party shall

 be given the opportunity to be heard on any proposed instruction on sentence

 before it is given. The military judge shall inform the parties of the proposed

action on such requests before their closing arguments on sentence.

#### Discussion

Requests for and objections to instructions should be resolved at

an Article 39(a) session. _But see_ R.C.M. 801(e)(1)(C); 803.

  The

military judge is not required to give the specific instruction requested

by counsel if the matter is adequately covered in the instructions.

  The

military judge should not identify the source of any instruction when addressing

the members.

  All written requests for instructions should

be marked as appellate exhibits, whether or not they are given.

### (d) How given.

Instructions on sentence shall be given orally on the record in

the presence of all parties and the members. Written copies of the instructions,

or unless a party objects, portions of them, may also be given to the members

for their use during deliberations.

#### Discussion

A copy of any written instructions delivered to the members should

be marked as an appellate exhibit.

### (e) Required instructions.

Instructions on sentence shall include:

(1) A statement of the maximum authorized punishment that may be adjudged

 and of the mandatory minimum punishment, if any;

##### Discussion

The maximum punishment that may be adjudged is the lowest of the total permitted by the applicable paragraph(s) in Part IV for each separate offense of which the accused was convicted (_see also_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning additional limits on punishments and additional punishments which may be adjudged) or the jurisdictional limit of the court-martial (_see_ R.C.M. 201(f) and R.C.M. 1301(d)).  _See also_ Discussion to R.C.M. 810(d).  The military judge may upon request or when otherwise appropriate instruct on lesser punishments.  _See_ R.C.M. 1003.  If an additional punishment is authorized under R.C.M. 1003(d), the members must be informed of the basis for the increased punishment.

  A carefully drafted sentence worksheet ordinarily should be used and should include reference to all authorized punishments in the case.

(2) A statement of the effect any sentence announced including a punitive

 discharge and confinement, or confinement in excess of six months, will

have on the accused's entitlement to pay and allowances;

(3) A statement of the procedures for deliberation and voting on the

 sentence set out in R.C.M. 1006;

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1004 concerning additional instructions

 required in capital cases.

(4) A statement informing the members that they are solely responsible

 for selecting an appropriate sentence and may not rely on the possibility

of any mitigating action by the convening or higher authority; and

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1002.

(5) A statement that the members should consider all matters in extenuation,

mitigation, and aggravation, whether introduced before or after findings,

and matters introduced under R.C.M. 1001(b)(1), (2), (3) and (5).

##### Discussion

For example, tailored instructions on sentencing should bring attention

to the reputation or record of the accused in the service for good conduct,

efficiency, fidelity, courage, bravery, or other traits of good character,

and any pretrial restraint imposed on the accused.

### (f) Waiver.

Failure to object to an instruction or to omission of an instruction

 before the members close to deliberate on the sentence constitutes waiver

of the objection in the absence of plain error. The military judge may require

the party objecting to specify in what respect the instructions were improper.

The parties shall be given the opportunity to be heard on any objection outside

the presence of the members.

## Rule 1006. Deliberations and voting on sentence

### (a) In general.

The members shall deliberate and vote after the military judge

instructs the members on sentence. Only the members shall be present during

deliberations and voting. Superiority in rank shall not be used in any manner

to control the independence of members in the exercise of their judgment.

### (b) Deliberations.

Deliberations may properly include full and free discussion of the

 sentence to be imposed in the case. Unless otherwise directed by the military

judge, members may take with them in deliberations their notes, if any,

any exhibits admitted in evidence, and any written instructions. Members

may request that the court-martial be reopened and that portions of the record

be read to them or additional evidence introduced. The military judge may,

in the exercise of discretion, grant such requests.

### (c) Proposal of sentences.

Any member may propose a sentence. Each proposal shall be in writing

 and shall contain the complete sentence proposed. The junior member shall

collect the proposed sentences and submit them to the president.

#### Discussion

A proposal should state completely each kind and, where appropriate,

 amount of authorized punishment proposed by that member. For example, a

proposal of confinement for life would state whether it is with or without

eligibility for parole. _See_ R.C.M.1003(b).

### (d) Voting.

#### (1) Duty of members.

Each member has the duty to vote for a proper sentence for the

offenses of which the court-martial found the accused guilty, regardless

of the member's vote or opinion as to the guilt of the accused.

#### (2) Secret ballot.

 Proposed sentences shall be voted on by secret written ballot.

#### (3) Procedure.

##### (A) Order.

All members shall vote on each proposed sentence in its entirety

 beginning with the least severe and continuing, as necessary, with the next

least severe, until a sentence is adopted by the concurrence of the number

of members required under subsection (d)(4) of this rule. The process of

proposing sentences and voting on them may be repeated as necessary until

a sentence is adopted.

##### (B) Counting votes.

 The junior member shall collect the ballots and count the votes.

The president shall check the count and inform the other members of the

result.

###### Discussion

A sentence adopted by the required number of members may be reconsidered

only in accordance with R.C.M. 1009.

#### (4) Number of votes required.

##### (A) Death.

A sentence which includes death may be adjudged only if all members

 present vote for that sentence.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1004.

##### (B) Confinement for life, with or without eligibility for parole, or more

 than 10 years.

A sentence that includes confinement for life, with or without

eligibility for parole, or more than 10 years may be adjudged only if at

least three-fourths of the members present vote for that sentence.

##### (C) Other.

A sentence other than those described in subsection (d)(4)(A) or

(B) of this rule may be adjudged only if at least two-thirds of the members

present vote for that sentence.

###### Discussion

In computing the number of votes required to adopt a sentence, any

 fraction of a vote is rounded up to the next whole number. For example,

if there are seven members, at least six would have to concur to impose a

 sentence requiring a three-fourths vote, while at least five would have to

 concur to impose a sentence requiring a two-thirds vote.

#### (5) Mandatory sentence.

When a mandatory minimum is prescribed under Article 118 the members

 shall vote on a sentence in accordance with this rule.

#### (6) Effect of failure to agree.

If the required number of members do not agree on a sentence after

a reasonable effort to do so, a mistrial may be declared as to the sentence

and the case shall be returned to the convening authority, who may order

a rehearing on sentence only or order that a sentence of no punishment be

imposed.

### (e) Action after a sentence is reached.

After the members have agreed upon a sentence, the court-martial

 shall be opened and the president shall inform the military judge that a

sentence has been reached. The military judge may, in the presence of the

parties, examine any writing which the president intends to read to announce

the sentence and may assist the members in putting the sentence in proper

form. Neither that writing nor any oral or written clarification or discussion

concerning it shall constitute announcement of the sentence.

#### Discussion

Ordinarily a sentence worksheet should be provided to the members

as an aid to putting the sentence in proper form. _See_ Appendix

11 for a format for forms of sentences. If a sentence worksheet has been

provided, the military judge should examine it before the president announces

 the sentence. If the military judge intends to instruct the members after

such examination, counsel should be permitted to examine the worksheet and

to be heard on any instructions the military judge may give.

  The

president should not disclose any specific number of votes for or against

any sentence.

  If the sentence is ambiguous or apparently

illegal, _ see_ R.C.M. 1009.

## Rule 1007. Announcement of sentence

### (a) In general.

The sentence shall be announced by the president or, in a court-martial

composed of a military judge alone, by the military judge, in the presence

of all parties promptly after it has been determined.

#### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 11.

  An element

of a sentence adjudged by members about which no instructions were given

and which is not listed on a sentence worksheet is not proper.

### (b) Erroneous announcement.

If the announced sentence is not the one actually determined by

the court-martial, the error may be corrected by a new announcement made

before the record of trial is authenticated and forwarded to the convening

authority. This action shall not constitute reconsideration of the sentence.

If the court-martial has been adjourned before the error is discovered,

the military judge may call the court-martial into session to correct the

announcement.

#### Discussion

For procedures governing reconsideration of the sentence, _

 see_ R.C.M. 1009. _See also_ R.C.M. 1102 concerning

the action to be taken if the error in the announcement is discovered after

the record is authenticated and forwarded to the convening authority.

### (c) Polling prohibited.

Except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 606, members may not otherwise

be questioned about their deliberations and voting.

## Rule 1008. Impeachment of sentence

A sentence which is proper on its face may be impeached only when

 extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the attention

of a member, outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member,

or unlawful command influence was brought to bear upon any member.

### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 923 Discussion concerning impeachment

of findings.

## Rule 1009. Reconsideration of sentence

### (a) Reconsideration.

Subject to this rule, a sentence may be reconsidered at any time

 before such sentence is announced in open session of the court.

### (b) Exceptions.

(1) If the sentence announced in open session was less than the mandatory

 minimum prescribed for an offense of which the accused has been found guilty,

the court that announced the sentence may reconsider such sentence upon

reconsideration in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule.

(2) If the sentence announced in open session exceeds the maximum permissible

punishment for the offense or the jurisdictional limitation of the court-martial,

the sentence may be reconsidered after announcement in accordance with subsection

(e) of this rule.

### (c) Clarification of sentence.

A sentence may be clarified at any time prior to action of the

convening authority on the case.

#### (1) Sentence adjudged by the military judge.

When a sentence adjudged by the military judge is ambiguous, the

 military judge shall call a session for clarification as soon as practical

after the ambiguity is discovered.

#### (2) Sentence adjudged by members.

When a sentence adjudged by members is ambiguous, the military judge

 shall bring the matter to the attention of the members if the matter is

discovered before the court-martial is adjourned. If the matter is discovered

 after adjournment, the military judge may call a session for clarification

by the members who adjudged the sentence as soon as practical after the ambiguity

 is discovered.

### (d) Action by the convening authority.

When a sentence adjudged by the court-martial is ambiguous, the

 convening authority may return the matter to the court-martial for clarification.

 When a sentence adjudged by the court-martial is apparently illegal, the

convening authority may return the matter to the court-martial for reconsideration

or may approve a sentence no more severe than the legal, unambiguous portions

of the adjudged sentence.

### (e) Reconsideration procedure.

Any member of the court-martial may propose that a sentence reached

 by the members be reconsidered.

#### (1) Instructions.

When a sentence has been reached by members and reconsideration

has been initiated, the military judge shall instruct the members on the

procedure for reconsideration.

#### (2) Voting.

The members shall vote by secret written ballot in closed session

 whether to reconsider a sentence already reached by them.

#### (3) Number of votes required.

##### (A) With a view to increasing.

Subject to subsection (b) of this rule, members may reconsider a

 sentence with a view of increasing it only if at least a majority vote for

reconsideration.

##### (B) With a view to decreasing.

Members may reconsider a sentence with a view to decreasing it only

 if:

(i) In the case of a sentence which includes death, at least one member

 votes to reconsider;

(ii) In the case of a sentence which includes confinement for life, with

 or without eligibility for parole, or more than 10 years, more than one-fourth

of the members vote to reconsider; or;

(iii) In the case of any other sentence, more than one-third of the members

 vote to reconsider.

####### Discussion

After a sentence has been adopted by secret ballot vote in closed

 session, no other vote may be taken on the sentence unless a vote to reconsider

succeeds.

  For example, if six of nine (two-thirds) members

adopt a sentence, a vote of at least five would be necessary to reconsider

to increase it; four would have to vote to reconsider in order to decrease

it. If seven of nine (three-fourths) members is required to adopt a sentence,

a vote of at least five would be necessary to reconsider to increase it,

while three would be necessary to reconsider to decrease it.

#### (4) Successful vote.

If a vote to reconsider a sentence succeeds, the procedures in R.C.M.

 1006 shall apply.

## Rule 1010. Notice concerning post-trial and appellate rights

In each general and special court-martial, prior to adjournment,

the military judge shall ensure that the defense counsel has informed the

accused orally and in writing of:

(a) The right to submit matters to the convening authority to consider

 before taking action;

(b) The right to appellate review, as applicable, and the effect of

 waiver or withdrawal of such right;

(c) The right to apply for relief from the Judge Advocate General if

the case is neither reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals nor reviewed

by the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1); and

(d) The right to the advice and assistance of counsel in the exercise

of the foregoing rights or any decision to waive them.

 The written

advice to the accused concerning post-trial and appellate rights shall be

signed by the accused and the defense counsel and inserted in the record

of trial as an appellate exhibit.

#### Discussion

The post-trial duties of the defense counsel concerning the appellate

 rights of the accused are set forth in paragraph (E)(iv) of the Discussion

accompanying R.C.M. 502(d)(6). The defense counsel shall explain the appellate

rights to the accused and prepare the written document of such advisement

prior to or during trial.

## Rule 1011. Adjournment

The military judge may adjourn the court-martial at the end of the

 trial of an accused or proceed to trial of other cases referred to that

court-martial. Such an adjournment may be for a definite or indefinite period.

### Discussion

A court-martial and its personnel have certain powers and responsibilities

following the trial. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 502(d)(5) Discussion

(F); 502(d)(6) Discussion (E); 808; 1007; 1009; Chapter XI.

# CHAPTER XI. POST-TRIAL PROCEDURE

## Rule 1101. Report of result of trial; post-trial restraint; deferment of confinement,

 forfeitures and reduction in grade; waiver of Article 58b forfeitures

### (a) Report of the result of trial.

After final adjournment of the court-martial in a case, the trial

 counsel shall promptly notify the accused's immediate commander, the convening

authority or the convening authority's designee, and, if appropriate, the

officer in charge of the confinement facility of the findings and sentence.

### (b) Post-trial confinement.

#### (1) In general.

An accused may be placed in post-trial confinement if the sentence

 adjudged by the court-martial includes death or confinement.

#### (2) Who may order confinement.

Unless limited by superior authority, a commander of the accused

may order the accused into post-trial confinement when post-trial confinement

is authorized under subsection (b)(1) of this rule. A commander authorized

 to order post-trial confinement under this subsection may delegate this

authority to the trial counsel.

##### Discussion

The commander may release the accused, order confinement, or order

 other appropriate restraint. Regardless whether the accused is ordered into

confinement, a sentence to confinement begins to run on the date it is adjudged

unless it is deferred under subsection (c) of this rule. _See_ Article

57.

#### (3) Confinement on other grounds.

Nothing in this rule shall prohibit confinement of a person after

a court-martial on proper grounds other than the offenses for which the

accused was tried at the court-martial.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 304, 305, and paragraph 5b(2), Part

V, for other grounds for confinement.

### (c) Deferment of confinement, forfeitures or reduction in grade.

#### (1) In general.

Deferment of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction

in grade is a postponement of the running of the sentence.

##### Discussion

Deferment is not suspension of the sentence or a form of clemency.

#### (2) Who may defer.

The convening authority or, if the accused is no longer in the

convening authority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is assigned, may, upon

written application of the accused, at any time after the adjournment of

the court-martial, defer the accused's service of a sentence to confinement,

forfeitures, or reduction in grade that has not been ordered executed.

#### (3) Action on deferment request.

The authority acting on the deferment request may, in that authority's

discretion, defer service of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction

in grade. The accused shall have the burden of showing that the interests

of the accused and the community in deferral outweigh the community's interests

in imposition of the punishment on its effective date. Factors that the authority

acting on a deferment request may consider in determining whether to grant

the deferment request include, where applicable: the probability of the

 accused's flight; the probability of the accused's commission of other offenses,

intimidation of witnesses, or interference with the administration of justice;

the nature of the offenses (including the effect on the victim) of which

the accused was convicted; the sentence adjudged; the command's immediate

need for the accused; the effect of deferment on good order and discipline

in the command; the accused's character, mental condition, family situation,

and service record. The decision of the authority acting on the deferment

 request shall be subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion.

The action of the authority acting on the deferment request shall be in

writing and a copy shall be provided to the accused.

##### Discussion

The deferment request and the action on the request must be attached

 to the record of trial. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(D). If the

request for deferment is denied, the basis for the denial should be in writing

and attached to the record of trial.

#### (4) Orders.

The action granting deferment shall be reported in the convening

 authority's action under R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E) and shall include the date

of the action on the request when it occurs prior to or concurrently with

the action. Action granting deferment after the convening authority's action

under R.C.M. 1107 shall be reported in orders under R.C.M. 1114 and included

in the record of trial.

#### (5) Restraint when deferment is granted.

When deferment of confinement is granted, no form of restraint or

 other limitation on the accused's liberty may be ordered as a substitute

form of punishment. An accused may, however, be restricted to specified

limits or conditions may be placed on the accused's liberty during the period

 of deferment for any other proper reason, including a ground for restraint

under R.C.M. 304.

#### (6) End of deferment.

Deferment of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction

in grade ends when:

(A) The convening authority takes action under R.C.M. 1107, unless the

 convening authority specifies in the action that service of confinement

after the action is deferred;

(B) The confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade are suspended;

(C) The deferment expires by its own terms; or

(D) The deferment is otherwise rescinded in accordance with subsection

 (c)(7) of this rule. Deferment of confinement may not continue after the

conviction is final under R.C.M. 1209.

###### Discussion

When the sentence is ordered executed, forfeitures or reduction

in grade may be suspended, but may not be deferred; deferral of confinement

may continue after action in accordance with R.C.M. 1107.  A form of punishment

cannot be both deferred and suspended at the same time.  When deferment of

confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade ends, the sentence to confinement,

 forfeitures, or reduction in grade begins to run or resumes running, as

appropriate. When the convening authority has specified in the action that

confinement will be deferred after the action, the deferment may not be terminated,

except under subsections (6)(B), (C), or (D), until the conviction is final

under R.C.M. 1209.

  See R.C.M. 1203 for deferment of a sentence

to confinement pending review under Article 67(a)(2).

#### (7) Rescission of deferment.

##### (A) Who may rescind.

The authority who granted the deferment or, if the accused is no

 longer within that authority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising general

court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is assigned,

may rescind the deferment.

##### (B) Action.

Deferment of confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade may

be rescinded when additional information is presented to a proper authority

which, when considered with all other information in the case, that authority

finds, in that authority's discretion, is grounds for denial of deferment

under subsection (c)(3) of this rule. The accused shall promptly be informed

of the basis for the rescission and of the right to submit written matters

in the accused's behalf and to request that the rescission be reconsidered.

 However, the accused may be required to serve the sentence to confinement,

 forfeitures, or reduction in grade pending this action.

##### (C) Execution.

When deferment of confinement is rescinded after the convening

authority's action under R.C.M. 1107, the confinement may be ordered executed.

However, no such order to rescind a deferment of confinement may be issued

within 7 days of notice of the rescission of a deferment of confinement to

the accused under subsection (c)(7)(B) of this rule, to afford the accused

an opportunity to respond. The authority rescinding the deferment may extend

this period for good cause shown. The accused shall be credited with any

confinement actually served during this period.

##### (D) Orders.

Rescission of a deferment before or concurrently with the initial

 action in the case shall be reported in the action under R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E),

which action shall include the dates of the granting of the deferment and

the rescission. Rescission of a deferment of confinement after the convening

authority's action shall be reported in supplementary orders in accordance

with R.C.M. 1114 and shall state whether the approved period of confinement

 is to be executed or whether all or part of it is to be suspended.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 16 for forms.

### (d) Waiving forfeitures resulting from a sentence to confinement to provide

 for dependent support.

(1) With respect to forfeiture of pay and allowances resulting only

by operation of law and not adjudged by the court, the convening authority

may waive, for a period not to exceed six months, all or part of the forfeitures

for the purpose of providing support to the accused's dependent(s). The

convening authority may waive and direct payment of any such forfeitures

when they become effective by operation of Article 57(a).

(2) Factors that may be considered by the convening authority in determining

the amount of forfeitures, if any, to be waived include, but are not limited

to, the length of the accused's confinement, the number and age(s) of the

accused's family members, whether the accused requested waiver, any debts

owed by the accused, the ability of the accused's family members to find

employment, and the availability of transitional compensation for abused

dependents permitted under 10 U.S.C. 1059.

(3) For the purposes of this Rule, a "dependent" means any

 person qualifying as a "dependent" under 37 U.S.C. 401.

##### Discussion

Forfeitures resulting by operation of law, rather than those adjudged

 as part of a sentence, may be waived for six months or for the duration

of the period of confinement, whichever is less. The waived forfeitures

are paid as support to dependent(s) designated by the convening authority.

 When directing waiver and payment, the convening authority should identify

by name the dependent(s) to whom the payments will be made and state the

number of months for which the waiver and payment shall apply. In cases

where the amount to be waived and paid is less than the jurisdictional limit

of the court, the monthly dollar amount of the waiver and payment should

be stated.

## Rule 1102. Post-trial sessions

### (a) In general.

Post-trial sessions may be proceedings in revision or Article 39(a)

 sessions. Such sessions may be directed by the military judge or the convening

authority in accordance with this rule.

### (b) Purpose.

#### (1) Proceedings in revision.

Proceedings in revision may be directed to correct an apparent error,

 omission, or improper or inconsistent action by the court-martial, which

can be rectified by reopening the proceedings without material prejudice

to the accused.

##### Discussion

Because the action at a proceeding in revision is corrective, a

 proceeding in revision may not be conducted for the purpose of presenting

additional evidence.

  Examples when a proceeding in revision

is appropriate include: correction of an ambiguous or apparently illegal

action by the court-martial; inquiry into the terms of a pretrial agreement;

and inquiry to establish the accused's awareness of certain rights.

  _

See also_ R.C.M. 1104(d) concerning correction of the record by certificate

 of correction.

#### (2) Article 39(a) sessions.

An Article 39(a) session under this rule may be called, upon motion of either party or _sua sponte_ by the military judge, for the purpose of inquiring into, and, when appropriate, resolving any matter that arises after trial and that substantially affects the legal sufficiency of any findings of guilty or the sentence.  The military judge may also call an Article 39(a) session, upon motion of either party or sua sponte, to reconsider any trial ruling that substantially affects the legal sufficiency of any findings of guilty or the sentence. The military judge may, _sua sponte_, at any time prior to authentication of the record of trial, enter a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses charged, or may enter a finding of not guilty of a part of a specification as long as a lesser offense charged is alleged in the remaining portion of the specification.  Prior to entering such a finding or findings, the military judge shall give each party an opportunity to be heard on the matter in a post-trial Article 39(a) session.

##### Discussion

For example, an Article 39(a) session may be called to permit a

 military judge to reconsider a trial ruling, or to examine allegations of

misconduct by a counsel, a member, or a witness. _See_ R.C.M. 917(d) for

the standard to be used to determine the legal sufficiency of evidence.

### (c) Matters not subject to post-trial sessions.

Post-trial session may not be directed:

(1) For reconsideration of a finding of not guilty of any specification,

 or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not guilty;

(2) For reconsideration of a finding of not guilty of any charge, unless

 the record shows a finding of guilty under a specification laid under that

charge, which sufficiently alleges a violation of some article of the code;

or

(3) For increasing the severity of the sentence unless the sentence

 prescribed for the offense is mandatory.

### (d) When directed.

The military judge may direct a post-trial session any time before

 the record is authenticated. The convening authority may direct a post-trial

session any time before the convening authority takes initial action on

the case or at such later time as the convening authority is authorized to

do so by a reviewing authority.

### (e) Procedure.

#### (1) Personnel.

The requirements of R.C.M. 505 and 805 shall apply at post-trial

 sessions except that-

(A) For a proceeding in revision, if trial was before members and the

 matter subject to the proceeding in revision requires the presence of members:

(i) The absence of any members does not invalidate the proceedings if,

in the case of a general court-martial, at least five members are present,

or, in the case of a special court-martial, at least three members are present;

and

(ii) A different military judge may be detailed, subject to R.C.M. 502(c)

 and 902, if the military judge who presided at the earlier proceedings is

not reasonably available.

(B) For an Article 39(a) session, a different military judge may be

 detailed, subject to R.C.M. 502(c) and 902, for good cause.

#### (2) Action.

The military judge shall take such action as may be appropriate,

 including appropriate instructions when members are present. The members

may deliberate in closed session, if necessary, to determine what corrective

action, if any, to take. Prior to the military judge _sua sponte_ entering a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses charged or entering a finding of not guilty of a part of a specification as long as a lesser offense charged is alleged in the remaining portion of the specification, the military judge shall give each party an opportunity to be heard on the matter.

#### (3) Record.

All post-trial sessions, except any deliberations by the members,

 shall be held in open session. The record of the post-trial sessions shall

be prepared, authenticated, and served in accordance with R.C.M. 1103 and

1104 and shall be included in the record of the prior proceedings.

## Rule 1102A. Post-trial hearing for person found not guilty only by reason of lack

of mental responsibility

### (a) In general.

The military judge shall conduct a hearing not later than forty

days following the finding that an accused is not guilty only by reason

of a lack of mental responsibility.

### (b) Psychiatric or psychological examination and report.

Prior to the hearing, the military judge or convening authority

shall order a psychiatric or psychological examination of the accused, with

the resulting psychiatric or psychological report transmitted to the military

 judge for use in the post-trial hearing.

### (c) Post-trial hearing.

(1) The accused shall be represented by defense counsel and shall have

 the opportunity to testify, present evidence, call witnesses on his or her

behalf, and to confront and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.

(2) The military judge is not bound by the rules of evidence except

with respect to privileges.

(3) An accused found not guilty only by reason of a lack of mental

responsibility of an offense involving bodily injury to another, or serious

damage to the property of another, or involving a substantial risk of such

injury or damage, has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence

that his or her release would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury

to another person or serious damage to property of another due to a present

mental disease or defect. With respect to any other offense, the accused

has the burden of such proof by a preponderance of the evidence.

(4) If, after the hearing, the military judge finds the accused has

 satisfied the standard specified in subsection (3) of this section, the

military judge shall inform the general court-martial convening authority

 of this result and the accused shall be released. If, however, the military

 judge finds after the hearing that the accused has not satisfied the standard

specified in subsection (3) of this section, then the military judge shall

inform the general court-martial convening authority of this result and that

authority may commit the accused to the custody of the Attorney General.

## Rule 1103. Preparation of record of trial

### (a) In general.

Each general, special, and summary court-martial shall keep a separate

record of the proceedings in each case brought before it.

### (b) General courts-martial.

#### (1) Responsibility for preparation.

 The trial counsel shall:

(A) Under the direction of the military judge, cause the record of trial

 to be prepared; and

(B) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, cause to

be retained stenographic or other notes or mechanical or electronic recordings

from which the record of trial was prepared.

#### (2) Contents.

##### (A) In general.

 The record of trial in each general court-martial shall be separate,

 complete, and independent of any other document.

##### (B) Verbatim transcript required.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) of this rule, the record of trial shall include a verbatim transcript of all sessions except sessions closed for deliberations and voting when:

(i) Any part of the sentence adjudged exceeds six months confinement,

 forfeiture of pay greater than two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture

of pay for more than six months or other punishments that may be adjudged

by a special court-martial; or

(ii) A bad-conduct discharge has been adjudged.

####### Discussion

A verbatim transcript includes: all proceedings including sidebar

 conferences, arguments of counsel, and rulings and instructions by the military

judge; matter which the military judge orders stricken from the record or

disregarded; and when a record is amended in revision proceedings (_

see_ R.C.M. 1102), the part of the original record changed and the

changes made, without physical alteration of the original record. Conferences

under R.C.M. 802 need not be recorded, but matters agreed upon at such conferences

must be included in the record. If testimony is given through an interpreter,

a verbatim transcript must so reflect.

##### (C) Verbatim transcript not required.

If a verbatim transcript is not required under subsection (b)(2)(B)

 of this rule, a summarized report of the proceedings may be prepared instead

of a verbatim transcript.

###### Discussion

_See also_ R.C.M. 910(i) concerning guilty plea

inquiries.

###### Discussion

Per R.C.M. 1114(f), consult service regulations for distribution of promulgating orders.

### (c) Special courts-martial.

#### (1) Involving a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months,

or forfeiture of pay for more than six months.

The requirements of subsections (b)(1), (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), (b)(2)(D),

and (b)(3) of this rule shall apply in a special court-martial in which a

bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture

of pay for more than six months, has been adjudged.

#### (2)  All other special courts-martial.

If the special court-martial resulted in findings of guilty but

a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture

of pay for more than six months, was not adjudged, the requirements of subsections

(b)(1), (b)(2)(D), and (b)(3)(A)-(F) and (I)-(M) of this rule shall apply.

### (d) Summary courts-martial.

The summary court-martial record of trial shall be prepared as

prescribed in R.C.M. 1305.

### (e) Acquittal; courts-martial resulting in findings of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility; termination prior to findings; termination after findings.

Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this rule, if proceedings resulted in an acquittal of all charges and specifications or in a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility of all charges and specifications, or if the proceedings were terminated by withdrawal, mistrial, or dismissal before findings, or if the proceedings were terminated after findings by approval of an administrative discharge in lieu of court-martial, the record may consist of the original charge sheet, a copy of the convening order and amending orders (if any), and sufficient information to establish jurisdiction over the accused and the offenses (if not shown on the charge sheet).  The convening authority or higher authority may prescribe additional requirements.

#### Discussion

The notes or recordings of court-martial proceedings described in

 this subsection should be retained if reinstitution and re-referral of the

affected charges is likely or when they may be necessary for the trial of

another accused in a related case. _See_ R.C.M. 905(g) and

914.

### (f) Loss of notes or recordings of the proceedings.

If, because of loss of recordings or notes, or other reasons, a

 verbatim transcript cannot be prepared when required by subsection (b)(2)(B)

or (c)(1) of this rule, a record which meets the requirements of subsection

(b)(2)(C) of this rule shall be prepared, and the convening authority may:

(1) Approve only so much of the sentence that could be adjudged by a

 special court-martial, except that a bad-conduct discharge, confinement

for more than six months, or forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for

more than six months, may not be approved; or

(2) Direct a rehearing as to any offense of which the accused was found

guilty if the finding is supported by the summary of the evidence contained

in the record, provided that the convening authority may not approve any sentence

imposed at such a rehearing more severe than or in excess of that adjudged

by the earlier court-martial.

### (g) Copies of the record of trial.

#### (1)  General and special courts-martial.

##### (A) In general.

In general and special courts-martial that require a verbatim transcript under subsections (b) or (c) of this rule and are subject to a review by a Court of Criminal Appeals under Article 66, the trial counsel shall cause to be prepared an original record of trial.

###### Discussion

An original record of trial includes any record of the proceedings recorded in a form that satisfies the definition of a "writing" in R.C.M. 103.  Any requirement to prepare a printed record of trial pursuant to this rule, either in lieu of or in addition to a record of trial recorded or compiled in some other format, including electronic or digital formats, is subject to service regulation.

##### (B) Additional copies.

The convening or higher authority may direct that additional copies

 of the record of trial of any general or special court-martial be prepared.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

Copies of the summary court-martial record of trial shall be prepared

 as prescribed in R.C.M. 1305(b).

#### (3) Cases involving sexual offenses.

##### (A) "Victim" defined.

	For the purposes of this rule, a victim is a person who suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of matters set forth in a charge or specification; and is named in a specification under Article 120, Article 120b, Article 120c, Article 125, or any attempt to commit such offense in violation of Article 80.

##### (B) Scope; qualifying victim.

 In a general or special court-martial, a copy of the record of trial shall be given free of charge to a victim as defined in subparagraph (A) for a specification identified in subparagraph (A) that resulted in any finding under R.C.M. 918 (a)(1). If a victim is a minor, a copy of the record of trial shall instead be provided to the parent or legal guardian of the victim.

###### Discussion

This rule is not intended to limit the Services' discretion to provide records of trial to other individuals.

##### (C) Notice.

 In accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned, and no later than authentication of the record, trial counsel shall cause each qualifying victim to be notified of the opportunity to receive a copy of the record of trial. Qualifying victims may decline receipt of such documents in writing and any written declination shall be attached to the original record of trial.

##### (D) Documents to be provided.

 For purposes of this subsection, the record of trial shall consist of documents described in subsection (b)(2) of this rule, except for proceedings described in subsection (e) of this rule, in which case the record of trial shall consist of items described in subsection (e). Matters attached to the record as described in subsection (b)(3) of this rule are not required to be provided.

###### Discussion

Subsections (b)(3)(N) and (g)(3) of this rule were added to implement Article 54(e), UCMJ, in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81, &sect; 586). Service of a copy of the record of trial on a victim is prescribed in R.C.M. 1104 (b)(1)(E).

### (h) Security classification.

If the record of trial contains matter which must be classified

under applicable security regulations, the trial counsel shall cause a proper

security classification to be assigned to the record of trial and on each

page thereof on which classified material appears.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1104(b)(1)(D) concerning the disposition

of records of trial requiring security protection.

### (i) Examination and correction before authentication.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

##### (A) Examination and correction by trial counsel.

In general and special courts-martial, the trial counsel shall

examine the record of trial before authentication and cause those changes

to be made which are necessary to report the proceedings accurately. The

trial counsel shall not change the record after authentication.

###### Discussion

The trial counsel may personally correct and initial the necessary

 changes or, if major changes are necessary, direct the reporter to rewrite

the entire record or the portion of the record which is defective.

  The

trial counsel must ensure that the reporter makes a true, complete, and accurate

record of the proceedings such that the record will meet the applicable requirements

 of this rule.

##### (B) Examination by defense counsel.

Except when unreasonable delay will result, the trial counsel shall

 permit the defense counsel to examine the record before authentication.

###### Discussion

If the defense counsel discovers errors or omissions in the record,

 the defense counsel may suggest to the trial counsel appropriate changes

to make the record accurate, forward for attachment to the record under

Article 38(c) any objections to the record, or bring any suggestions for

correction of the record to the attention of the person who authenticates

the record.

  The defense counsel should be granted reasonable

access to the reporter's notes and tapes to facilitate the examination of

the record.

  A suitable notation that the defense counsel

has examined the record should be made on the authentication page. _

See_ Appendix 13 or 14 for sample forms.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

The summary court-martial shall examine and correct the summary

 court-martial record of trial as prescribed in R.C.M. 1305(a).

### (j) Videotape and similar records.

#### (1) Recording proceedings.

If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, general

and special courts-martial may be recorded by videotape, audiotape, or similar

material from which sound and visual images may be reproduced to accurately

depict the entire court-martial. Such means of recording may be used in lieu

of recording by a qualified court reporter, when one is required, subject

to this rule.

#### (2) Preparation of written record.

When the court-martial, or any part of it, is recorded by videotape, audiotape, or similar material under subsection (j)(1) of this rule, a transcript or summary in writing (as defined in R.C.M. 103), as required in subsection (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), (b)(2)(C), or (c) of this rule, as appropriate, shall be prepared in accordance with this rule and R.C.M. 1104 before the record is forwarded under R.C.M. 1104(e), unless military exigencies prevent transcription.

#### (3) Military exigency.

If military exigency prevents preparation of a written transcript

or summary, as required, and when the court-martial has been recorded by

videotape, audiotape, or similar material under subsection (j)(1) of this

rule, the videotape, audiotape, or similar material, together with the matters

in subsections (b)(2)(D) and (b)(3) of this rule shall be authenticated and

forwarded in accordance with R.C.M. 1104, provided that in such case the

convening authority shall cause to be attached to the record a statement

of the reasons why a written record could not be prepared, and provided further

that in such case the defense counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity

to listen to or to view and listen to the recording whenever defense counsel

 is otherwise entitled to examine the record under these rules. Subsection

(g) of this rule shall not apply in case of military exigency under this

subsection.

#### (4) Further review.

##### (A) Cases reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeals.

Before review, if any, by a Court of Criminal Appeals of a case

in which the record includes an authenticated recording prepared under subsection

(j)(3) of this rule, a complete written transcript shall be prepared and

certified as accurate in accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

The authenticated recording shall be retained for examination by appellate

authorities.

##### (B) Cases not reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeals.

In cases in which the record includes an authenticated recording

 prepared under subsection (j)(3) of this rule, a written record shall be

prepared under such circumstances as the Secretary concerned may prescribe.

#### (5) Accused's copy.

When a record includes an authenticated recording under subsection

 (j)(3) of this rule, the Government shall, in order to comply with R.C.M.

1104(b):

(A) Provide the accused with a duplicate copy of the videotape, audiotape,

or similar matter and copies of any written contents of and attachments to

the record, and give the accused reasonable opportunity to use such viewing

equipment as is necessary to listen to or view and listen to the recording;

or

(B) With the written consent of the accused, defer service of the record

 until a written record is prepared under subsection (4) of this rule.

## Rule 1103A. Sealed exhibits and proceedings.

### (a) In general.

If the report of preliminary hearing or record of trial contains exhibits, proceedings, or other matter ordered sealed by the preliminary hearing officer or military judge, counsel for the government or trial counsel shall cause such materials to be sealed so as to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure. Counsel for the government or trial counsel shall ensure that such materials are properly marked, including an annotation that the material was sealed by order of the preliminary hearing officer or military judge, and inserted at the appropriate place in the original record of trial. Copies of the report of preliminary hearing or record of trial shall contain appropriate annotations that matters were sealed by order of the preliminary hearing officer or military judge and have been inserted in the report of preliminary hearing or original record of trial.

#### (b) Examination of sealed exhibits and proceedings.

Except as provided in the following subsections to this rule, sealed exhibits may not be examined.

##### (1) Prior to referral.

The following individuals may examine sealed materials only if necessary for proper fulfillment of their responsibilities under the UCMJ, the MCM, governing directives, instructions, regulations, applicable rules for practice and procedure, or rules of professional responsibility: the judge advocate advising the convening authority who directed the Article 32 preliminary hearing; the convening authority who directed the Article 32 preliminary hearing; the staff judge advocate to the general court-martial convening authority; and the general court-martial convening authority.

###### (2) Prior to authentication.

 Prior to authentication of the record by the military judge, sealed materials may not be examined in the absence of an order from the military judge based on good cause shown.

####### (3) Authentication through action.

After authentication and prior to disposition of the record of trial pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial 1111, sealed materials may not be examined in the absence of an order from the military judge upon a showing of good cause at a post-trial Article 39a session directed by the Convening Authority.

######## Discussion

 A convening authority who has granted clemency based upon review of sealed materials in the record of trial is not permitted to disclose the contents of the sealed materials when providing a written explanation of the reason for such action, as directed under R.C.M. 1107.

######## (4) Reviewing and appellate authorities.

(A) Reviewing and appellate authorities may examine sealed matters when those authorities determine that such action is reasonably necessary to a proper fulfillment of their responsibilities under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Manual for Courts-Martial, governing directives, instructions, regulations, applicable rules for practice and procedure, or rules of professional responsibility.

(B) Reviewing and appellate authorities shall not, however, disclose sealed matter or information in the absence of:

(i) Prior authorization of the Judge Advocate General in the case of review under Rule for Courts-Martial 1201(b); or

(ii) Prior authorization of the appellate court before which a case is pending review under Rules for Courts-Martial 1203 and 1204.

(C) In those cases in which review is sought or pending before the United States Supreme Court, authorization to disclose sealed materials or information shall be obtained under that Court's rules of practice and procedure.

(D) The authorizing officials in paragraph (B)(ii) above may place conditions on authorized disclosures in order to minimize the disclosure.

(E) For purposes of this rule, reviewing and appellate authorities are limited to:

(i) Judge advocates reviewing records pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial 1112;

(ii) Officers and attorneys in the office of the Judge Advocate General reviewing records pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial 1201(b);

(iii) Appellate government counsel;

(iv) Appellate defense counsel;

(v) Appellate judges of the Courts of Criminal Appeals and their professional staffs;

(vi) The judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and their professional staffs;

(vii) The Justices of the United States Supreme Court and their professional staffs; and

(viii) Any other court of competent jurisdiction.

######## (5) Examination of sealed matters.

For the purpose of this rule, "examination" includes reading, viewing, photocopying, photographing, disclosing, or manipulating the sealed matters in any way.

## Rule 1104. Records of trial: Authentication; service; loss; correction; forwarding

### (a) Authentication.

#### (1) In general.

A record is authenticated by the signature of a person specified in this rule who thereby declares that the record accurately reports the proceedings.  An electronic record of trial may be authenticated with the electronic signature of the military judge or other authorized person.  Service of an authenticated electronic copy of the record of trial with a means to review the record of trial satisfies the requirement of service under R.C.M. 1105(c) and 1305(d).  No person may be required to authenticate a record of trial if that person is not satisfied that it accurately reports the proceedings.

#### (2) General and special courts-martial.

##### (A) Authentication by the military judge.

In special courts-martial in which a bad-conduct discharge, confinement

for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months,

has been adjudged and in general courts-martial, except as provided in subsection

(a)(2)(B) of this rule, the military judge present at the end of the proceedings

shall authenticate the record of trial, or that portion over which the military

 judge presided. If more than one military judge presided over the proceedings,

each military judge shall authenticate the record of the proceedings over

which that military judge presided, except as provided in subsection (a)(2)(B)

of this rule. The record of trial of special courts-martial in which a bad-conduct

 discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for

more than six months, was not adjudged shall be authenticated in accordance

 with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

##### (B) Substitute authentication.

If the military judge cannot authenticate the record of trial because

 of the military judge's death, disability, or absence, the trial counsel

present at the end of the proceedings shall authenticate the record of trial.

If the trial counsel cannot authenticate the record of trial because of the

trial counsel's death, disability, or absence, a member shall authenticate

the record of trial. In a court-martial composed of a military judge alone,

or as to sessions without members, the court reporter shall authenticate

the record of trial when this duty would fall upon a member under this subsection.

A person authorized to authenticate a record under this subsection may authenticate

the record only as to those proceedings at which that person was present.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 13 or 14 for sample forms.

  Substitute

authentication is authorized only in emergencies. A brief, temporary absence

of the military judge from the situs of the preparation of the record of

trial does not justify a substitute authentication. Prolonged absence, including

permanent change of station, ordinarily justifies substitute authentication.

  The

person who authenticates the record of trial instead of the military judge

should attach to the record of trial an explanation for the substitute authentication.

 _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3) (E).

#### (3) Summary courts-martial.

The summary court-martial shall authenticate the summary court-martial

record of trial as prescribed in R.C.M. 1305(a).

### (b) Service.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

##### (A) Service of record of trial on accused.

In each general and special court-martial, except as provided in

 subsection (b)(1)(C) or (D) of this rule, the trial counsel shall cause

a copy of the record of trial to be served on the accused as soon as the

record of trial is authenticated.

##### (B) Proof of service of record of trial on accused.

The trial counsel shall cause the accused's receipt for the copy

of the record of trial to be attached to the original record of trial. If

it is impracticable to secure a receipt from the accused before the original

 record of trial is forwarded to the convening authority, the trial counsel

 shall prepare a certificate indicating that a copy of the record of trial

has been transmitted to the accused, including the means of transmission

 and the address, and cause the certificate to be attached to the original

 record of trial. In such a case the accused's receipt shall be forwarded

to the convening authority as soon as it is obtained.

##### (C) Substitute service.

If it is impracticable to serve the record of trial on the accused

 because of the transfer of the accused to a distant place, the unauthorized

absence of the accused, or military exigency, or if the accused so requests

on the record at the court-martial or in writing, the accused's copy of the

record shall be forwarded to the accused's defense counsel, if any. Trial

counsel shall attach a statement to the record explaining why the accused

was not served personally. If the accused has more than one counsel, R.C.M.

1106(f)(2) shall apply. If the accused has no counsel and if the accused

is absent without authority, the trial counsel shall prepare an explanation

for the failure to serve the record. The explanation and the accused's copy

 of the record shall be forwarded with the original record. The accused shall

 be provided with a copy of the record as soon as practicable.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 13 or 14 for sample forms.

##### (D) Classified information.

###### (i) Forwarding to convening authority.

If the copy of the record of trial prepared for the accused contains

 classified information, the trial counsel, unless directed otherwise by

the convening authority, shall forward the accused's copy to the convening

authority, before it is served on the accused.

###### (ii) Responsibility of the convening authority.

The convening authority shall:

(a) cause any classified information to be deleted or withdrawn from

the accused's copy of the record of trial;

(b) cause a certificate indicating that classified information has been

 deleted or withdrawn to be attached to the record of trial; and

(c) cause the expurgated copy of the record of trial and the attached

 certificate regarding classified information to be served on the accused

as provided in subsections (b)(1)(A) and (B) of this rule except that the

accused's receipt shall show that the accused has received an expurgated

copy of the record of trial.

###### (iii) Contents of certificate.

The certificate regarding deleted or withdrawn classified information

 shall indicate:

(a) that the original record of trial may be inspected in the Office

of the Judge Advocate General concerned under such regulations as the Secretary

concerned may prescribe;

(b) the pages of the record of trial from which matter has been deleted;

(c) the pages of the record of trial which have been entirely deleted;

 and

(d) the exhibits which have been withdrawn.

####### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1103(h) concerning classified information.

##### (E) Victims of Sexual Assault.

Qualifying victims, as defined in R.C.M. 1103 (g)(3)(A), shall be served a copy of the record of trial in the same manner as the accused under subsection (b) of this rule. In accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned:

###### Discussion

Subsection (b)(1)(E) of this rule was added to implement Article 54(e), UCMJ, in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81, &sect; 586). The content of the victim's record of trial is prescribed in R.C.M. 1103(g)(3)(D).

  Promulgating orders are to be distributed in accordance with R.C.M. 1114(f).

(i) A copy of the record of trial shall be provided to each qualifying victim as soon as it is authenticated or, if the victim requests, at a time thereafter. The victim's receipt of the record of trial, including any delay in receiving it, shall be documented and attached to the original record of trial.

(ii) A copy of the convening authority's action as described in R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(D)(iv) shall be provided to each qualifying victim as soon as each document is prepared. If the victim makes a request in writing, service of the record of trial may be delayed until the action is available.

(iii) Classified information pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(D) of this rule, sealed matters pursuant to R.C.M. 1103A, or other portions of the record the release of which would unlawfully violate the privacy interests of any party, to include those afforded by 5 U.S.C.&sect;552a, the Privacy Act of 1974, shall not be provided. Matters attached to the record as described in R.C.M. 1103 (b)(3) are not required to be provided.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

The summary court-martial record of trial shall be disposed of as

 provided in R.C.M. 1305(d). Subsection (b)(1)(D) of this rule shall apply

if classified information is included in the record of trial of a summary

court-martial.

### (c) Loss of record.

If the authenticated record of trial is lost or destroyed, the trial

 counsel shall, if practicable, cause another record of trial to be prepared

for authentication. The new record of trial shall become the record of trial

in the case if the requirements of R.C.M. 1103 and this rule are met.

### (d) Correction of record after authentication; certificate of correction.

#### (1) In general.

A record of trial found to be incomplete or defective after authentication

may be corrected to make it accurate. A record of trial may be returned to

the convening authority by superior competent authority for correction under

this rule.

##### Discussion

The record of trial is corrected with a certificate of correction.

  _

See_ Appendix 13 or 14 for a form for a certificate of correction.

A certificate of correction may be used only to make the record of trial

correspond to the actual proceedings. If the members were not sworn, for

example, the error cannot be cured by a certificate of correction. If the

members were sworn but the record did not so reflect, the record could be

corrected.

#### (2) Procedure.

An authenticated record of trial believed to be incomplete or defective

may be returned to the military judge or summary court-martial for a certificate

of correction. The military judge or summary court-martial shall give notice

of the proposed correction to all parties and permit them to examine and

respond to the proposed correction before authenticating the certificate

of correction. All parties shall be given reasonable access to any original

reporter's notes or tapes of the proceedings.

##### Discussion

The type of opportunity to respond depends on the nature and scope

of the proposed correction. In many instances an adequate opportunity can

be provided by allowing the respective parties to present affidavits and

 other documentary evidence to the person authenticating the certificate of

 correction or by a conference telephone call among the authenticating person,

the parties, and the reporter. In other instances, an evidentiary hearing

 with witnesses may be required. The accused need not be present at any hearing

 on a certificate of correction.

#### (3) Authentication of certificate of correction; service on the accused.

The certificate of correction shall be authenticated as provided

in subsection (a) of this rule and a copy served on the accused as provided

in subsection (b) of this rule. The certificate of correction and the accused's

receipt for the certificate of correction shall be attached to each copy

of the record of trial required to be prepared under R.C.M. 1103(g).

### (e) Forwarding.

After every court-martial, including a rehearing and new and other

 trials, the authenticated record shall be forwarded to the convening authority

for initial review and action, provided that in case of a special court-martial

in which a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year was adjudged

or a general court-martial, the convening authority shall refer the record

to the staff judge advocate or legal officer for recommendation under R.C.M.

1106 before the convening authority takes action.

## Rule 1105. Matters submitted by the accused

**[Note: R.C.M. 1105(b)(1) and (b)(2) apply to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.]**

### (a) In general.

After a sentence is adjudged in any court-martial, the accused may

 submit matters to the convening authority in accordance with this rule.

### (b) Matters which may be submitted.

(1) The accused may submit to the convening authority any matters that may reasonably tend to affect the convening authority's decision whether to disapprove any findings of guilty or to approve the sentence, except as may be limited by R.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(C). The convening authority is only required to consider written submissions.

(2) Submissions are not subject to the Military Rules of Evidence and

may include:

(A) Allegations of errors affecting the legality of the findings or

 sentence;

(B) Portions or summaries of the record and copies of documentary evidence

offered or introduced at trial;

(C) Matters in mitigation which were not available for consideration at the court-martial, except as may be limited by R.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(B); and

###### Discussion

For example, post-trial conduct of the accused, such as providing

 restitution to the victim or exemplary behavior, might be appropriate.

(D) Clemency recommendations by any member, the military judge, or any

 other person. The defense may ask any person for such a recommendation.

###### Discussion

A clemency recommendation should state reasons for the recommendation

 and should specifically indicate the amount and character of the clemency

recommended.

  A clemency recommendation by a member should

not disclose the vote or opinion of any member expressed in deliberations.

Except as provided in R.C.M. 923 and 1008 and Mil. R. Evid. 606(b), a clemency

 recommendation does not impeach the findings or the sentence. If the sentencing

authority makes a clemency recommendation in conjunction with the announced

sentence, _see_ R.C.M. 1106(d)(3).

  Although

only written submissions must be considered, the convening authority may

consider any submission by the accused, including, but not limited to, videotapes,

 photographs, and oral presentations.

### (c) Time periods.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

After a general or special court-martial, the accused may submit

 matters under this rule within the later of 10 days after a copy of the

authenticated record of trial or, if applicable, the recommendation of the

staff judge advocate or legal officer, or an addendum to the recommendation

containing new matter is served on the accused. If, within the 10-day period,

the accused shows that additional time is required for the accused to submit

such matters, the convening authority or that authority's staff judge advocate

 may, for good cause, extend the 10-day period for not more than 20 additional

 days; however, only the convening authority may deny a request for such

an extension.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

After a summary court-martial, the accused may submit matters under

 this rule within 7 days after the sentence is announced. If the accused

shows that additional time is required for the accused to submit such comments,

the convening authority may, for good cause, extend the period in which comments

may be submitted for up to 20 additional days.

#### (3) Post-trial sessions.

A post-trial session under R.C.M. 1102 shall have no effect on the

 running of any time period in this rule, except when such session results

in the announcement of a new sentence, in which case the period shall run

from that announcement.

#### (4) Good cause.

For purposes of this rule, good cause for an extension ordinarily

 does not include the need for securing matters which could reasonably have

been presented at the court-martial.

### (d) Waiver.

#### (1) Failure to submit matters.

Failure to submit matters within the time prescribed by this rule

 shall be deemed a waiver of the right to submit such matters.

#### (2) Submission of matters.

Submission of any matters under this rule shall be deemed a waiver

of the right to submit additional matters unless the right to submit additional

matters within the prescribed time limits is expressly reserved in writing.

#### (3) Written waiver.

The accused may expressly waive, in writing, the right to submit

 matters under this rule. Once filed, such waiver may not be revoked.

#### (4) Absence of accused.

If, as a result of the unauthorized absence of the accused, the

 record cannot be served on the accused in accordance with R.C.M. 1104(b)(1)

and if the accused has no counsel to receive the record, the accused shall

be deemed to have waived the right to submit matters under this rule within

the time limit which begins upon service on the accused of the record of

trial.

##### Discussion

The accused is not required to raise objections to the trial proceedings

in order to preserve them for later review.

## Rule 1105A. Matters submitted by a crime victim

### (a) In general.

 A crime victim of an offense tried by any court-martial shall have the right to submit a written statement to the convening authority after the sentence is adjudged.

### (b) "Crime victim" defined.

 For purposes of this rule, a crime victim is a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense of which the accused was found guilty, and on which the convening authority is taking action under R.C.M. 1107. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the term includes one of the following (in order of precedence): a spouse, legal guardian, parent, child, sibling, or similarly situated family member. For a victim that is an institutional entity, the term includes an authorized representative of the entity.

### (c) Format of statement.

 The statement shall be in writing, and signed by the crime victim. Statements may include photographs, but shall not include video, audio, or other media.

#### Discussion

Statements should be submitted to the convening authority's staff judge advocate or legal officer, or, in the case of a summary court-martial, to the summary court-martial officer.

### (d) Timing of statement.

#### (1) General and special courts-martial.

 The crime victim shall submit the statement to the convening authority's staff judge advocate or legal officer no later than 10 days after the later of:

(A) if the victim is entitled to a copy of the record of proceedings in accordance with Article 54(e), UCMJ, the date on which the victim receives an authenticated copy of the record of trial or waives the right to receive such a copy; or

(B) the date on which the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer is served on the victim.

#### (2) Summary courts-martial.

 The crime victim shall submit the statement to the summary court-martial officer no later than 7 days after the sentence is announced.

#### (3) Extensions.

 If a victim shows that additional time is required for submission of matters, the convening authority or other person taking action, for good cause, may extend the submission period for not more than an additional 20 days.

### (e) Notice.

 Subject to such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, trial counsel or the summary court-martial officer shall make reasonable efforts to inform crime victims of their rights under this rule, and shall advise such crime victims on the manner in which their statements may be submitted.

### (f) Waiver.

#### (1) Failure to submit a statement.

 Failure to submit a statement within the time prescribed by this rule shall be deemed a waiver of the right to submit such a statement.

#### (2) Submission of a statement.

 Submission of a statement under this rule shall be deemed a waiver of the right to submit an additional statement.

#### (3) Written waiver.

 A crime victim may expressly waive, in writing, the right to submit a statement under this rule. Once filed, such waiver may not be revoked.

## Rule 1106. Recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer

### (a) In general.

Before the convening authority takes action under R.C.M. 1107 on a record of trial by general court-martial, on a record of trial by special court-martial that includes a sentence to a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year, or on a record of trial by special court-martial in which a victim is entitled to submit a statement pursuant to R.C.M. ll05A, that convening authority's staff judge advocate or legal officer shall, except as provided in subsection (c) of this rule, forward to the convening authority a recommendation under this rule.

### (b) Disqualification.

No person who has acted as member, military judge, trial counsel,

 assistant trial counsel, defense counsel, associate or assistant defense

counsel, or preliminary hearing officer in any case may later act as a staff judge

advocate or legal officer to any reviewing or convening authority in the

same case.

#### Discussion

The staff judge advocate or legal officer may also be ineligible

 when, for example, the staff judge advocate or legal officer; served as

the defense counsel in a companion case; testified as to a contested matter

 (unless the testimony is clearly uncontroverted); has other than an official

 interest in the same case; or must review that officer's own pretrial action

(such as the pretrial advice under Article 34; _see_ R.C.M.

406) when the sufficiency or correctness of the earlier action has been placed

in issue.

### (c) When the convening authority has no staff judge advocate.

#### (1) When the convening authority does not have a staff judge advocate or

 legal officer or that person is disqualified.

If the convening authority does not have a staff judge advocate

or legal officer, or if the person serving in that capacity is disqualified

under subsection (b) of this rule or otherwise, the convening authority

shall:

(A) Request the assignment of another staff judge advocate or legal

 officer to prepare a recommendation under this rule; or

(B) Forward the record for action to any officer exercising general

 court-martial jurisdiction as provided in R.C.M. 1107(a).

#### (2) When the convening authority has a legal officer but wants the recommendation

of a staff judge advocate.

If the convening authority has a legal officer but no staff judge

 advocate, the convening authority may, as a matter of discretion, request

designation of a staff judge advocate to prepare the recommendation.

### (d) Form and content of recommendation.

(1) The purpose of the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer is to assist the convening authority to decide what action to take on the sentence in the exercise of command prerogative.  The staff judge advocate or legal officer shall use the record of trial in the preparation of the recommendation, and may also use the personnel records of the accused or other matters in advising the convening authority whether clemency is warranted.

#### (2) Form.

The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall be a concise written communication.

#### (3) Required contents.

Except as provided in subsection (e), the staff judge advocate or legal advisor shall provide the convening authority with a copy of the report of results of the trial, setting forth the findings, sentence, and confinement credit to be applied; a copy or summary of the pretrial agreement, if any; a copy of any statement submitted by a crime victim pursuant to R.C.M. 1l05A; any recommendation for clemency by the sentencing authority made in conjunction with the announced sentence; and the staff judge advocate's concise recommendation.

##### Discussion

 The recommendation required by this rule need not include information regarding other recommendations for clemency. It may include a summary of clemency actions authorized under R.C.M. 1107. _See_ R.C.M. 1105(b)(2)(D) (pertaining to clemency recommendations that may be submitted by the accused to the convening authority).

##### (4) Legal errors.

The staff judge advocate or legal officer is not required to examine the record for legal errors.  However, when the recommendation is prepared by a staff judge advocate, the staff judge advocate shall state whether, in the staff judge advocate's opinion, corrective action on the findings or sentence should be taken when an allegation of legal error is raised in matters submitted under R.C.M. 1105 or when otherwise deemed appropriate by the staff judge advocate.  The response may consist of a statement of agreement or disagreement with the matter raised by the accused.  An analysis or rationale for the staff judge advocate's statement, if any, concerning legal error is not required.

##### (5) Optional matters.

The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer may include, in addition to matters included under subsection (d)(3) and (4) of this rule, any additional matters deemed appropriate by the staff judge advocate or legal officer.  Such matter may include matters outside the record.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(B)(iii) if matters adverse to the accused from outside the record are included.

##### (6) Effect of error.

In case of error in the recommendation not otherwise waived under subsection (f)(6) of this rule, appropriate corrective action shall be taken by appellate authorities without returning the case for further action by a convening authority.

### (e) No findings of guilty; findings of not guilty only by reason of lack

of mental responsibility.

If the proceedings resulted in an acquittal or in a finding of not

 guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility of all charges and

specifications, or if, after the trial began, the proceedings were terminated

without findings and no further action is contemplated, a recommendation

under this rule is not required.

### (f) Service of recommendation on defense counsel, accused,

and victim; defense response.

#### (1) Service of recommendation on defense counsel, accused, and victim.

 Before forwarding the recommendation and the record of trial to the convening authority for action under R.C.M. 1107, the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall cause a copy of the recommendation to be served on the counsel for the accused. A separate copy will be served on the accused. If it is impracticable to serve the recommendation on the accused for reasons including the transfer of the accused to a different place, the unauthorized absence of the accused, or military exigency, or if the accused so requests on the record at the court-martial or in writing, the accused's copy shall be forwarded to the accused's defense counsel. A statement shall be attached to the record explaining why the accused was not served personally. If the accused was found guilty of any offense that resulted in direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm to a victim or victims, a separate copy of the recommendation will be served on that victim or those victims. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, deceased, or otherwise unavailable, service shall be made on one of the following (in order of precedence): the victim's attorney, spouse, legal guardian, parent, child, sibling, or similarly situated family member. For a victim that is an institutional entity, service shall be made on an authorized representative of the entity.

##### Discussion

The method of service and the form of the proof of service are not

 prescribed and may be by any appropriate means. _See_ R.C.M.

1103(b)(3)(G). For example, a certificate of service, attached to the record

of trial, would be appropriate when the accused is served personally.

#### (2) Counsel for the accused.

The accused may, at trial or in writing to the staff judge advocate

 or legal officer before the recommendation has been served under this rule,

designate which counsel (detailed, individual military, or civilian) will

be served with the recommendation. In the absence of such designation, the

staff judge advocate or legal officer shall cause the recommendation to be

served in the following order of precedence, as applicable, on: (1) civilian

counsel; (2) individual military counsel; or (3) detailed defense counsel.

If the accused has not retained civilian counsel and the detailed defense

counsel and individual military counsel, if any, have been relieved or are

not reasonably available to represent the accused, substitute military counsel

to represent the accused shall be detailed by an appropriate authority. Substitute

counsel shall enter into an attorney-client relationship with the accused

before examining the recommendation and preparing any response.

##### Discussion

When the accused is represented by more than one counsel, the military

judge should inquire of the accused and counsel before the end of the court-martial

as to who will act for the accused under this rule.

#### (3) Record of trial.

The staff judge advocate or legal officer shall, upon request of

 counsel for the accused served with the recommendation, provide that counsel

with a copy of the record of trial for use while preparing the response

to the recommendation.

#### (4) Response.

Counsel for the accused may submit, in writing, corrections or rebuttal to any matter in the recommendation and its enclosures believed to be erroneous, inadequate, or misleading, and may comment on any other matter.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1105.

#### (5) Time period.

Counsel for the accused shall be given 10 days from service of the

 record of trial under R.C.M. 1104(b) or receipt of the recommendation, whichever

is later, in which to submit comments on the recommendation. The convening

authority may, for good cause, extend the period in which comments may be

submitted for up to 20 additional days.

#### (6) Waiver.

Failure of counsel for the accused to comment on any matter in the

 recommendation or matters attached to the recommendation in a timely manner

shall waive later claim of error with regard to such matter in the absence

of plain error.

##### Discussion

The accused is not required to raise objections to the trial proceedings

in order to preserve them for later review.

#### (7) New matter in addendum to recommendation.

The staff judge advocate or legal officer may supplement the recommendation

after the accused and counsel for the accused have been served with the recommendation

and given an opportunity to comment. When new matter is introduced after

the accused and counsel for the accused have examined the recommendation,

 however, the accused and counsel for the accused must be served with the

new matter and given 10 days from service of the addendum in which to submit

comments. Substitute service of the accused's copy of the addendum upon

counsel for the accused is permitted in accordance with the procedures outlined

in subparagraph (f)(1) of this rule.

##### Discussion

"New matter" includes discussion of the effect of new decisions on issues in the case, matter from outside the record of trial, and issues not previously discussed. "New matter" does not ordinarily include any discussion by the staff judge advocate or legal officer of the correctness of the initial defense comments on the recommendation. The method of service and the form of the proof of service are not prescribed and may be by any appropriate means. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(G). For example, a certificate of service, attached to the record of trial, would be appropriate when the accused is served personally. If a victim statement, submitted under R.C.M. 1105A, is served on the accused prior to service of the recommendation, then that statement shall not be considered a "new matter" when it is again served on the accused as an enclosure to the recommendation.

## Rule 1107. Action by convening authority

**[Note: R.C.M. 1107(b)-(f) apply to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014; however, if at least one offense in a case occurred prior to 24 June 2014, then the prior version of RCM 1107 applies to all offenses in the case, except that mandatory minimum sentences under Article 56(b) and applicable rules under RCM 1107(d)(1)(D)-(E) still apply.]**

### (a) Who may take action.

The convening authority shall take action on the sentence and, in

the discretion of the convening authority, the findings, unless it is impracticable.

If it is impracticable for the convening authority to act, the convening

authority shall, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned

may prescribe, forward the case to an officer exercising general court-martial

 jurisdiction who may take action under this rule.

#### Discussion

The convening authority may not delegate the function of taking

 action on the findings or sentence. The convening authority who convened

the court-martial may take action on the case regardless whether the accused

is a member of or present in the convening authority's command.

  It

would be impracticable for the convening authority to take initial action

when, for example, a command has been decommissioned or inactivated before

the convening authority's action; when a command has been alerted for immediate

overseas movement; or when the convening authority is disqualified because

 the convening authority has other than an official interest in the case or

 because a member of the court-martial which tried the accused later became

the convening authority.

  If the convening authority forwards

the case to an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction for

initial review and action, the record should include a statement of the reasons

why the convening authority did not act.

### (b) General considerations.

#### (1) Discretion of convening authority.

Any action to be taken on the findings and sentence is within the sole discretion of the convening authority. The convening authority is not required to review the case for legal errors or factual sufficiency.

##### Discussion

The action is taken in the interests of justice, discipline, mission

 requirements, clemency, and other appropriate reasons. If errors are noticed

by the convening authority, the convening authority may take corrective

action under this rule.

#### (2) When action may be taken.

The convening authority may take action only after the applicable

 time periods under R.C.M. 1105(c) have expired or the accused has waived

the right to present matters under R.C.M. 1105(d), whichever is earlier,

subject to regulations of the Secretary concerned.

#### (3) Matters considered.

##### (A) Required matters.

Before taking action, the convening authority shall consider:

(i) The result of trial;

####### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1101(a).

(ii) The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer

under R.C.M. 1106, if applicable; and

(iii) Any matters submitted by the accused under R.C.M. 1105 or, if applicable, R.C.M. 1106(f);

(iv) Any statement submitted by a crime victim pursuant to R.C.M. 1105A and subsection (C) below.

##### (B) Additional matters.

Before taking action the convening authority may consider:

(i) The record of trial, subject to the provisions of R.C.M. 1103A and subsection (C) below;

(ii) The personnel records of the accused; and

(iii) Such other matters as the convening authority deems appropriate.

 However, if the convening authority considers matters adverse to the accused

from outside the record, with knowledge of which the accused is not chargeable,

the accused shall be notified and given an opportunity to rebut.

##### (C) Prohibited matters.

The convening authority shall not consider any matters that relate to the character of a victim unless such matters were presented as evidence at trial and not excluded at trial.

#### (4) When proceedings resulted in finding of not guilty or not guilty only

by reason of lack of mental responsibility, or there was a ruling amounting

to a finding of not guilty.

The convening authority shall not take action disapproving a finding

 of not guilty, a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental

responsibility, or a ruling amounting to a finding of not guilty. When an

accused is found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility,

the convening authority, however, shall commit the accused to a suitable

facility pending a hearing and disposition in accordance with R.C.M. 1102A.

##### Discussion

Commitment of the accused to the custody of the Attorney General

for hospitalization is discretionary.

#### (5) Action when accused lacks mental capacity.

The convening authority may not approve a sentence while the accused

 lacks mental capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligently

in the post-trial proceedings. In the absence of substantial evidence to

the contrary, the accused is presumed to have the capacity to understand

and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the post-trial proceedings.

If a substantial question is raised as to the requisite mental capacity

of the accused, the convening authority may direct an examination of the

accused in accordance with R.C.M. 706 before deciding whether the accused

lacks mental capacity, but the examination may be limited to determining

 the accused's present capacity to understand and cooperate in the post-trial

 proceedings. The convening authority may approve the sentence unless it

is established, by a preponderance of the evidence-including matters

outside the record of trial-that the accused does not have the requisite

mental capacity. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the convening

authority from disapproving the findings of guilty and sentence.

### (c) Action on findings.

Action on the findings is not required. However, the convening authority may take action subject to the following limitations:

(1) For offenses charged under subsection (a) or (b) of Article 120; offenses charged under Article 120b; and offenses charged under Article 125.

(A) The convening authority is prohibited from:

(i) Setting aside any finding of guilt or dismissing a specification; or

(ii) Changing a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification.

(B) The convening authority may direct a rehearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule.

(2) For offenses other than those listed in subsection (c)(1) for which the maximum sentence of confinement that may be adjudged does not exceed two years without regard to the jurisdictional limits of the court; and the sentence adjudged does not include dismissal, a dishonorable discharge, bad-conduct discharge, or confinement for more than six months:

(A) The convening authority may change a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification; or

(B) Set aside any finding of guilty and:

(i) Dismiss the specification and, if appropriate, the charge; or

(ii) Direct a rehearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule.

(3) If the convening authority acts to dismiss or change any charge or specification for an offense, the convening authority shall provide, at the same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.

### (d) Action on the sentence.

#### (1) In general.

(A) The convening authority may not disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, any portion of an adjudged sentence of confinement for more than six months.

(B) The convening authority may not disapprove, commute, or suspend that portion of an adjudged sentence that includes a dismissal, dishonorable discharge, or bad-conduct discharge.

(C) The convening authority may disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, any portion of an adjudged sentence not explicitly prohibited by this rule, to include reduction in pay grade, forfeitures of pay and allowances, fines, reprimands, restrictions, and hard labor without confinement.

(D) The convening authority shall not disapprove, commute, or suspend any mandatory minimum sentence of dismissal or dishonorable discharge except in accordance with subsection (E) below.

##### (E) Exceptions.

###### (i) Trial counsel recommendation.

 Upon the recommendation of the trial counsel, in recognition of the substantial assistance by the accused in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section shall have the authority to disapprove, commute, or suspend the adjudged sentence, in whole or in part, even with respect to an offense for which a mandatory minimum sentence exists.

####### Discussion

 The phrase "investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense" includes offenses under the UCMJ or other Federal, State, local, or foreign criminal statutes.

###### (ii) Pretrial agreement.

 If a pretrial agreement has been entered into by the convening authority and the accused as authorized by R.C.M. 705, the convening authority shall have the authority to approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend a sentence, in whole or in part, pursuant to the terms of the pretrial agreement. The convening authority may commute a mandatory sentence of a dishonorable discharge to a bad-conduct discharge pursuant to the terms of the pretrial agreement.

(F) If the convening authority acts to disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, the sentence of the court-martial for an offense, the convening authority shall provide, at the same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.

###### Discussion

 A sentence adjudged by a court-martial may be approved if it was within the jurisdiction of the court-martial to adjudge (_see_ R.C.M.201(f)) and did not exceed the maximum limits prescribed in Part IV and Chapter X of this Part for the offense(s) of which the accused legally has been found guilty.

 When mitigating forfeitures, the duration and amounts of forfeiture may be changed as long as the total amount forfeited is not increased and neither the amount nor duration of the forfeitures exceeds the jurisdiction of the court-martial. When mitigating confinement or hard labor without confinement, the convening authority should use the equivalencies at

R.C.M. 1003(b)(5)-(6), as appropriate.

 Unless prohibited by this rule, the convening authority may disapprove, mitigate or change to a less severe punishment any individual component of a sentence. For example, if an accused is found guilty of assault consummated by a battery and sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, three months of confinement, and reduction to E-1, without a pre-trial agreement and without being able to apply the substantial assistance exception, the convening authority may disapprove or reduce any part of the sentence except the bad-conduct discharge.

#### (2) Determining what sentence should be approved.

The convening authority shall, subject to the limitations in subsection (d)(1) above, approve that sentence which is warranted by the circumstances of the offense and appropriate for the accused.

##### Discussion

 In determining what sentence should be approved, the convening authority should consider all relevant and permissible factors including the possibility of rehabilitation, the deterrent effect of the sentence, and all matters relating to clemency, such as pretrial confinement. _See also_ R.C.M. 1001- 1004.

 When an accused is not serving confinement, the accused should not be deprived of more than two-thirds pay for any month as a result of one or more sentences by court-martial and other stoppages or involuntary deductions, unless requested by the accused. Since court-martial forfeitures constitute a loss of entitlement of the pay concerned, they take precedence over all debts.

#### (3) Deferring service of a sentence to confinement.

(A) In a case in which a court-martial sentences an accused referred

to in subsection (B), below, to confinement, the convening authority may

defer service of a sentence to confinement by a court-martial, without the

consent of the accused, until after the accused has been permanently released

to the armed forces by a state or foreign country.

(B) Subsection (A) applies to an accused who, while in custody of a

state or foreign country, is temporarily returned by that state or foreign

country to the armed forces for trial by court-martial; and after the court-martial,

is returned to that state or foreign country under the authority of a mutual

 agreement or treaty, as the case may be.

(C) As used in subsection (d)(3), the term "state" means

a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, a territory, and

a possession of the United States.

###### Discussion

The convening authority's decision to postpone service of a court-martial

sentence to confinement normally should be reflected in the action.

#### (4) Limitations on sentence based on record of trial.

If the record of trial does not meet the requirements of R.C.M.

 1103(b)(2)(B) or (c)(1), the convening authority may not approve a sentence

in excess of that which may be adjudged by a special court-martial, or one

that includes a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months,

forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture of

pay for more than six months.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(f).

#### (5) Limitations on sentence of a special court-martial where a fine has

been adjudged.

A convening authority may not approve in its entirety a sentence

 adjudged at a special court-martial when, if approved, the cumulative impact

of the fine and forfeitures, whether adjudged or by operation of Article

58b, would exceed the jurisdictional maximum dollar amount of forfeitures

that may be adjudged at that court-martial.

### (e) Ordering rehearing or other trial.

#### (1) Rehearing.

##### (A) In general.

Subject to subsections (e)(1)(B) through (e)(1)(E) of this rule,

the convening authority may in the convening authority's discretion order

a rehearing. A rehearing may be ordered as to some or all offenses of which

 findings of guilty were entered and the sentence, or as to sentence only.

###### Discussion

A rehearing may be appropriate when an error substantially affecting

 the findings or sentence is noticed by the convening authority. The severity

of the findings or the sentence of the original court-martial may not be

 increased at a rehearing unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is

 mandatory. _See_ R.C.M. 810(d). If the accused is placed

under restraint pending a rehearing, _ see_ R.C.M. 304; 305.

##### (B) When the convening authority may order a rehearing.

The convening authority may order a rehearing:

(i) When taking action on the court-martial under this rule;

(ii) In cases subject to review by the Court of Criminal Appeals, before the case is forwarded under R.C.M. 1111(a)(1) or (b)(1), but only as to any sentence which was approved or findings of guilty as we not disapproved in any earlier action.  In cases of rehearing under paragraph (c)(2), a supplemental action disapproving the sentence and some or all of the findings , as appropriate, shall be taken; or

###### (iii) When authorized to do so by superior competent authority.

If the convening authority finds a rehearing as to any offenses

 impracticable, the convening authority may dismiss those specifications

and, when appropriate, charges.

####### Discussion

A sentence rehearing, rather than a reassessment, may be more appropriate

in cases where a significant part of the government's case has been dismissed.

 The convening authority may not take any actions inconsistent with directives

of superior competent authority. Where that directive is unclear, appropriate

clarification should be sought from the authority issuing the original directive.

###### (iv) Sentence reassessment.

If a superior authority has approved some of the findings of guilty

and has authorized a rehearing as to other offenses and the sentence, the

convening authority may, unless otherwise directed, reassess the sentence

based on the approved findings of guilty and dismiss the remaining charges.

 Reassessment is appropriate only where the convening authority determines

that the accused's sentence would have been at least of a certain magnitude

had the prejudicial error not been committed and the reassessed sentence is

appropriate in relation to the affirmed findings of guilty.

##### (C) Limitations.

###### (i) Sentence approved.

A rehearing shall not be ordered if, in the same action, a sentence

 is approved.

###### (ii) Rehearing on sentence only.

A rehearing on sentence only shall not be referred to a different

 kind of court-martial from that which made the original findings. If the

convening authority determines a rehearing on sentence is impracticable,

 the convening authority may approve a sentence of no punishment without

conducting a rehearing.

##### (D) Additional charges.

Additional charges may be referred for trial together with charges

as to which a rehearing has been directed.

##### (E) Lesser included offenses.

If at a previous trial the accused was convicted of a lesser included

 offense, a rehearing may be ordered only as to that included offense or

as to an offense included in that found. If, however, a rehearing is ordered

improperly on the original offense charged and the accused is convicted of

that offense at the rehearing, the finding as to the lesser included offense

of which the accused was convicted at the original trial may nevertheless

be approved.

#### (2) "Other" trial.

The convening or higher authority may order an "other"

 trial if the original proceedings were invalid because of lack of jurisdiction

or failure of a specification to state an offense. The authority ordering

an "other" trial shall state in the action the basis for declaring

the proceedings invalid.

### (f) Contents of action and related matters.

#### (1) In general.

The convening authority shall state in writing and insert in the

 record of trial the convening authority's decision as to the sentence, whether

any findings of guilty are disapproved, and orders as to further disposition.

 The action shall be signed personally by the convening authority. The convening

authority's authority to sign shall appear below the signature.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 16 for forms.

#### (2) Modification of initial action.

Subject to the limitations in subsections (c) and (d) above, the convening authority may recall and modify any action taken by that convening authority at any time before it has been published or before the accused has been officially notified. The convening authority may also recall and modify any action at any time prior to forwarding the record for review, as long as the modification does not result in action less favorable to the accused than the earlier action. In addition, in any special court-martial, the convening authority may recall and correct an illegal, erroneous, incomplete, or ambiguous action at any time before completion of review under R.C.M. 1112, as long as the correction does not result in action less favorable to the accused than the earlier action. When so directed by a higher reviewing authority or the Judge Advocate General, the convening authority shall modify any incomplete, ambiguous, void, or inaccurate action noted in review of the record of trial under Articles 64, 66, 67, or examination of the record of trial under Article 69. The convening authority shall personally sign any supplementary or corrective action. A written explanation is required for any modification of initial action which: 1) sets aside any finding of guilt or dismisses or changes any charge or specification for an offense; or 2) disapproves, commutes, or suspends, in whole or in part, the sentence. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.

##### Discussion

For purposes of this rule, a record is considered to have been

forwarded for review when the convening authority has either delivered it

in person or has entrusted it for delivery to a third party over whom the

 convening authority exercises no lawful control (_e.g._, the

 United States Postal Service).

#### (3) Findings of guilty.

If any findings of guilty are disapproved, the action shall so state.

 If a rehearing is not ordered, the affected charges and specifications shall

be dismissed by the convening authority in the action. If a rehearing or

other trial is directed, the reasons for the disapproval shall be set forth

 in the action.

##### Discussion

If a rehearing or other trial is not directed, the reasons for

disapproval need not be stated in the action, but they may be when appropriate.

It may be appropriate to state them when the reasons may affect administrative

disposition of the accused; for example, when the finding is disapproved

because of the lack of mental responsibility of the accused or the running

of the statute of limitations.

  No express action is necessary

to approve findings of guilty. _See_ subsection (c) of this

rule.

#### (4) Action on sentence.

##### (A) In general.

The action shall state whether the sentence adjudged by the court-martial

is approved. If only part of the sentence is approved, the action shall state

which parts are approved. A rehearing may not be directed if any sentence

is approved.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 16 for forms.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1108 concerning suspension of sentences.

  _

See_ R.C.M. 1113 concerning execution of sentences.

##### (B) Execution; suspension.

The action shall indicate, when appropriate, whether an approved

 sentence is to be executed or whether the execution of all or any part of

the sentence is to be suspended. No reasons need be stated.

##### (C) Place of confinement.

If the convening authority orders a sentence of confinement into

 execution, the convening authority shall designate the place of confinement

in the action, unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned. If

a sentence of confinement is ordered into execution after the initial action

of the convening authority, the authority ordering the execution shall designate

the place of confinement unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(2)(C) concerning the place

of confinement.

##### (D) Custody or confinement pending appellate review; capital cases.

When a record of trial involves an approved sentence to death, the

 convening authority shall, unless any approved sentence of confinement has

been ordered into execution and a place of confinement designated, provide

in the action for the temporary custody or confinement of the accused pending

final disposition of the case on appellate review.

##### (E) Deferment of service of sentence to confinement.

Whenever the service of the sentence to confinement is deferred

by the convening authority under R.C.M. 1101(c) before or concurrently with

the initial action in the case, the action shall include the date on which

the deferment became effective. The reason for the deferment need not be

 stated in the action.

##### (F) Credit for illegal pretrial confinement.

When the military judge has directed that the accused receive credit

 under R.C.M. 305(k), the convening authority shall so direct in the action.

##### (G) Reprimand.

The convening authority shall include in the action any reprimand

 which the convening authority has ordered executed.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1003(b)(1) concerning reprimands.

#### (5) Action on rehearing or new or other trial.

##### (A) Rehearing or other trial.

In acting on a rehearing or other trial the convening authority

shall be subject to the sentence limitations prescribed in R.C.M. 810(d).

Except when a rehearing or other trial is combined with a trial on additional

offenses and except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 810(d), if any part

of the original sentence was suspended and the suspension was not properly

vacated before the order directing the rehearing, the convening authority

shall take the necessary suspension action to prevent an increase in the

same type of punishment as was previously suspended. The convening authority

may approve a sentence adjudged upon a rehearing or other trial regardless

whether any kind or amount of the punishment adjudged at the former trial

has been served or executed. However, in computing the term or amount of punishment

to be actually served or executed under the new sentence, the accused shall

be credited with any kind or amount of the former sentence included within

the new sentence that was served or executed before the time it was disapproved

or set aside. The convening authority shall, if any part of a sentence adjudged

upon a rehearing or other trial is approved, direct in the action that any

part or amount of the former sentence served or executed between the date

it was adjudged and the date it was disapproved or set aside shall be credited

 to the accused. If, in the action on the record of a rehearing, the convening

 authority disapproves the findings of guilty of all charges and specifications

which were tried at the former hearing and that part of the sentence which

was based on these findings, the convening authority shall, unless a further

 rehearing is ordered, provide in the action that all rights, privileges,

and property affected by any executed portion of the sentence adjudged at

the former hearing shall be restored. The convening authority shall take

 the same restorative action if a court-martial at a rehearing acquits the

 accused of all charges and specifications which were tried at the former

hearing.

##### (B) New trial.

The action of the convening authority on a new trial shall, insofar

 as practicable, conform to the rules prescribed for rehearings and other

trials in subsection (f)(5)(A) of this rule.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 810 for procedures at other trials.

  In approving a sentence not in excess of or more severe than one previously approved (_see_ R.C.M. 810(d)), a convening authority is prohibited from approving a punitive discharge more severe than one formerly approved, e.g., a convening authority is prohibited from approving a dishonorable discharge if a bad conduct discharge had formerly been approved.  Otherwise, in approving a sentence not in excess of or more severe than one previously imposed, a convening authority is not limited to approving the same or lesser type of "other punishments" formerly approved.

### (g) Incomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous action.

When the action of the convening authority or of a higher authority is incomplete or ambiguous or contains error, the authority who took the incomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous action may be instructed by an authority acting under Articles 64, 66, 67, 67a, or 69 to withdraw the original action and substitute a corrected action.

### (h) Service on accused.

A copy of the convening authority's action shall be served on the

 accused or on defense counsel. If the action is served on defense counsel,

 defense counsel shall, by expeditious means, provide the accused with a

copy.

#### Discussion

If the promulgating order is prepared promptly, service of it will

 satisfy subsection (h).

## Rule 1108. Suspension of execution of sentence; remission

### (a) In general.

Suspension of a sentence grants the accused a probationary period

 during which the suspended part of an approved sentence is not executed,

and upon the accused's successful completion of which the suspended part

of the sentence shall be remitted. Remission cancels the unexecuted part

 of a sentence to which it applies.

### (b) Who may suspend and remit.

**[Note: R.C.M. 1108(b) applies to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.]**

The convening authority may, after approving the sentence, suspend the execution of all or any part of the sentence of a court-martial, except for a sentence of death or as prohibited under R.C.M. 1107(d). The general court-martial convening authority over the accused at the time of the court-martial may, when taking action under R.C.M. 1112(f), suspend or remit any part of the sentence. The Secretary concerned and, when designated by the Secretary concerned, any Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Judge Advocate General, or commanding officer may suspend or remit any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence other than a sentence approved by the President or a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole that has been ordered executed. The Secretary concerned may, however, suspend or remit the unexecuted part of a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole only after the service of a period of confinement of not less than 20 years. The commander of the accused who has the authority to convene a court-martial of the kind that adjudged the sentence may suspend or remit any part of the unexecuted part of any sentence by summary court-martial or of any sentence by special court-martial that does not include a bad-conduct discharge regardless of whether the person acting has previously approved the sentence. The "unexecuted part of any sentence" is that part that has been approved and ordered executed but that has not actually been carried out.

#### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1113 (execution of sentences); R.C.M.

 1201 (action by the Judge Advocate General); R.C.M. 1206 (powers and responsibilities

of the Secretary).

  The military judge and members of courts-martial

may not suspend sentences.

### (c) Conditions of suspension.

The authority who suspends the execution of the sentence of a court-martial

shall:

(1) Specify in writing the conditions of the suspension;

(2) Cause a copy of the conditions of the suspension to be served on

the probationer; and

(3) Cause a receipt to be secured from the probationer for service of

the conditions of the suspension.

 Unless otherwise stated, an

action suspending a sentence includes as a condition that the probationer

 not violate any punitive article of the code.

### (d) Limitations on suspension.

Suspension shall be for a stated period or until the occurrence

of an anticipated future event. The period shall not be unreasonably long.

The Secretary concerned may further limit by regulations the period for

which the execution of a sentence may be suspended. The convening authority

shall provide in the action that unless the suspension is sooner vacated,

the expiration of the period of suspension shall remit the suspended portion

of the sentence. An appropriate authority may, before the expiration of the

period of suspension, remit any part of the sentence, including a part which

has been suspended; reduce the period of suspension; or, subject to R.C.M.

1109, vacate the suspension in whole or in part.

### (e) Termination of suspension by remission.

Expiration of the period provided in the action suspending a sentence

 or part of a sentence shall remit the suspended portion unless the suspension

is sooner vacated. Death or separation which terminates status as a person

subject to the code shall result in remission of the suspended portion of

the sentence.

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1109(b)(4) concerning interruption

of the period of suspension.

## Rule 1109. Vacation of suspension of sentence

### (a) In general.

Suspension of execution of the sentence of a court-martial may be

 vacated for violation of the conditions of the suspension as provided in

this rule.

### (b) Timeliness.

#### (1) Violation of conditions.

Vacation shall be based on a violation of the conditions of suspension

which occurs within the period of suspension.

#### (2) Vacation proceedings.

Vacation proceedings under this rule shall be completed within a

 reasonable time.

#### (3) Order vacating the suspension.

The order vacating the suspension shall be issued before the expiration

of the period of suspension.

##### Discussion

The order vacating a suspended sentence must be issued before the

end of suspension even though, in certain cases, it may not be effective

as an order of execution of the suspended sentence until the completion

of appellate review or action by the President or the Secretary concerned.

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113 concerning execution of sentences.

#### (4) Interruptions to the period of suspension.

Unauthorized absence of the probationer or the commencement of

proceedings under this rule to vacate suspension interrupts the running of

the period of suspension.

### (c) Confinement of probationer pending vacation proceedings.

#### (1) In general.

A probationer under a suspended sentence to confinement may be

confined pending action under subsection (d)(2) of this rule, in accordance

with the procedures in this subsection.

#### (2) Who may order confinement.

Any person who may order pretrial restraint under R.C.M. 304(b)

may order confinement of a probationer under a suspended sentence to confinement.

#### (3) Basis for confinement.

A probationer under a suspended sentence to confinement may be

ordered into confinement upon probable cause to believe the probationer violated

any conditions of the suspension.

##### Discussion

A determination that confinement is necessary to ensure the presence

 of the probationer or to prevent further misconduct is not required.

  If

the violation of the conditions also constitutes an offense under the code

for which trial by court-martial is considered, an appropriate form of pretrial

 restraint may be imposed as an alternative to confinement under this rule. _

See_ R.C.M. 304 and 305.

#### (4) Review of confinement.

Unless proceedings under subsection (d)(1), (e), (f), or (g) of

this rule are completed within 7 days of imposition of confinement of the

probationer (not including any delays requested by probationer), a preliminary

hearing shall be conducted by a neutral and detached officer appointed in

accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

##### (A) Rights of accused.

 Before the preliminary hearing, the accused shall be notified in

 writing of:

(i) The time, place, and purpose of the hearing, including the alleged

 violation(s) of the conditions of suspension;

(ii) The right to be present at the hearing;

(iii) The right to be represented at the hearing by civilian counsel

provided by the probationer or, upon request, by military counsel detailed

for this purpose; and

(iv) The opportunity to be heard, to present witnesses who are reasonably

 available and other evidence, and the right to confront and cross-examine

adverse witnesses unless the hearing officer determines that this would

subject these witnesses to risk or harm. For purposes of this subsection,

a witness is not reasonably available if the witness requires reimbursement

by the United States for cost incurred in appearing, cannot appear without

unduly delaying the proceedings or, if a military witness, cannot be excused

from other important duties.

##### (B) Rules of evidence.

Except for Mil. R. Evid. Section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid.

302 and 305, the Military Rules of Evidence shall not apply to matters considered

at the preliminary hearing under this rule.

##### (C) Decision.

The hearing officer shall determine whether there is probable cause

 to believe that the probationer violated the conditions of the probationer's

suspension. If the hearing officer determines that probable cause is lacking,

the hearing officer shall issue a written order directing that the probationer

released from confinement. If the hearing officer determines that there is

probable cause to believe that the probationer violated the conditions of

suspension, the hearing officer shall set forth in a written memorandum,

detailing therein the evidence relied upon and reasons for making the decision.

 The hearing officer shall forward the original memorandum or release order

to the probationer's commander and forward a copy to the probationer and

 the officer in charge of the confinement facility.

### (d) Vacation of suspended general court-martial sentence.

#### (1) Action by officer having special court-martial jurisdiction over probationer.

##### (A) In general.

Before vacation of the suspension of any general court-martial

sentence, the officer having special court-martial jurisdiction over the

probationer shall personally hold a hearing on the alleged violation of

the conditions of suspension. If there is no officer having special court-martial

jurisdiction over the probationer who is subordinate to the officer having

general court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer, the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer shall personally

hold a hearing under subsection (d)(1) of this rule. In such cases, subsection

(d)(1)(D) of this rule shall not apply.

##### (B) Notice to probationer.

Before the hearing, the officer conducting the hearing shall cause

 the probationer to be notified in writing of:

(i) The time, place, and purpose of the hearing;

(ii) The right to be present at the hearing;

(iii) The alleged violation(s) of the conditions of suspension and the

 evidence expected to be relied on;

(iv) The right to be represented at the hearing by civilian counsel

provided by the probationer or, upon request, by military counsel detailed

for this purpose; and

(v) The opportunity to be heard, to present witnesses and other evidence,

 and the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses unless the

hearing officer determines that there is good cause for not allowing confrontation

and cross-examination.

####### Discussion

The notice should be provided sufficiently in advance of the hearing

 to permit adequate preparation.

##### (C) Hearing.

The procedure for the vacation hearing shall follow that prescribed

 in R.C.M. 405(g), (h)(1), and (i).

##### (D) Record and recommendation.

The officer who conducts the vacation proceeding shall make a summarized

record of the proceeding and forward the record and that officer's written

recommendation concerning vacation to the officer exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction over the probationer.

##### (E) Release from confinement.

If the special court-martial convening authority finds there is

not probable cause to believe that the probationer violated the conditions

of the suspension, the special court-martial convening authority shall order

the release of the probationer from any confinement ordered under subsection

(c) of this rule. The special court-martial convening authority shall, in

any event, forward the record and recommendation under subsection (d)(1)(D)

of this rule.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 18 for a sample of a Report of Proceedings

to Vacate Suspension of a General Court-Martial Sentence under Article 72,

UCMJ, and R.C.M. 1109 (DD Form 455).

#### (2) Action by officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over

 probationer.

##### (A) In general.

The officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the

 probationer shall review the record produced by and the recommendation of

the officer exercising special court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer,

decide whether the probationer violated a condition of suspension, and, if

so, decide whether to vacate the suspended sentence. If the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction decides to vacate the suspended sentence,

that officer shall prepare a written statement of the evidence relied on

and the reasons for vacating the suspended sentence.

##### (B) Execution.

Any unexecuted part of a suspended sentence ordered vacated under

 this rule shall, subject to R.C.M. 1113(c), be ordered executed.

### (e)  Vacation of a suspended special court-martial sentence wherein a

bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year was not adjudged.

#### (1) In general.

Before vacating the suspension of a special court-martial punishment

 that does not include a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year,

the special court-martial convening authority for the command in which the

 probationer is serving or assigned shall cause a hearing to be held on the

 alleged violation(s) of the conditions of suspension.

#### (2) Notice to probationer.

The person conducting the hearing shall notify the probationer,

in writing, before the hearing of the rights specified in subsection (d)(1)(B)

of this rule.

#### (3) Hearing.

The procedure for the vacation hearing shall follow that prescribed

 in R.C.M. 405(g), (h)(1), and (i).

#### (4) Authority to vacate suspension.

The special court-martial convening authority for the command in

 which the probationer is serving or assigned shall have the authority to

vacate any punishment that the officer has the authority to order executed.

#### (5) Record and recommendation.

If the hearing is not held by the commander with authority to vacate

 the suspension, the person who conducts the hearing shall make a summarized

record of the hearing and forward the record and that officer's written

recommendation concerning vacation to the commander with authority to vacate

the suspension.

#### (6) Decision.

The special court-martial convening authority shall review the record

 produced by and the recommendation of the person who conducted the vacation

proceeding, decide whether the probationer violated a condition of suspension,

and, if so, decide whether to vacate the suspended sentence.  If the officer

exercising jurisdiction decides to vacate the suspended sentence, that officer

shall prepare a written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons

for vacating the suspended sentence.

#### (7) Execution.

Any unexecuted part of a suspended sentence ordered vacated under

 this subsection shall be ordered executed.

### (f)  Vacation of a suspended special court-martial sentence that includes

a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year.

(1) The procedure for the vacation of a suspended approved bad-conduct

 discharge or of any suspended portion of an approved sentence to confinement

for one year, shall follow that set forth in subsection (d) of this rule.

(2) The procedure for the vacation of a suspension of any lesser special

 court-martial punishment shall follow that set forth in subsection (e) of

this rule.

##### Discussion

An officer exercising special court-martial jurisdiction may vacate

 any suspended punishments other than an approved suspended bad-conduct discharge

or any suspended portion of an approved sentence to confinement for one

year, regardless of whether they are contained in the same sentence as the

bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year. See Appendix 18 for a

sample of a Report of Proceedings to Vacate Suspension of a Special Court-Martial

Sentence including a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year under

Article 72, UCMJ, and R.C.M. 1109 (DD Form 455).

### (g) Vacation of a suspended summary court-martial sentence.

year, the accused may waive or withdraw appellate review.

#### Discussion

Appellate review is not available for special courts-martial in

which a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year was not adjudged

or approved or for summary courts-martial. Cases not subject to appellate

review, or in which appellate review is waived or withdrawn, are reviewed

by a judge advocate under R.C.M. 1112. Such cases may also be submitted to

the Judge Advocate General for review. _See_ R.C.M. 1201(b)(3).

Appellate review is mandatory when the approved sentence includes death.

### (b) Right to counsel.

#### (1) In general.

 under R.C.M. 502(d)(1) before submitting a waiver or withdrawal of appellate

review.

#### (2) Waiver.

##### (A) Counsel who represented the accused at the court-martial.

The accused shall have the right to consult with any civilian,

individual military, or detailed counsel who represented the accused at the

court-martial concerning whether to waive appellate review unless such counsel

has been excused under R.C.M. 505(d)(2)(B).

##### (B) Associate counsel.

If counsel who represented the accused at the court-martial has

not been excused but is not immediately available to consult with the accused,

because of physical separation or other reasons, associate defense counsel

 shall be detailed to the accused upon request by the accused. Such counsel

 shall communicate with counsel who represented the accused at the court-martial,

and shall advise the accused concerning whether to waive appellate review.

##### (C) Substitute counsel.

If counsel who represented the accused at the court-martial has

been excused under R.C.M. 505(d)(2)(B), substitute defense counsel shall

be detailed to advise the accused concerning waiver of appellate rights.

##### (A) Appellate defense counsel.

If the accused is represented by appellate defense counsel, the

 accused shall have the right to consult with such counsel concerning whether

to withdraw the appeal.

of physical separation or other reasons, associate defense counsel shall

be detailed to the accused, upon request by the accused. Such counsel shall

communicate with appellate defense counsel and shall advise the accused whether

to withdraw the appeal.

##### (C) No counsel.

If appellate defense counsel has not been assigned to the accused,

 defense counsel shall be detailed for the accused. Such counsel shall advise

the accused concerning whether to withdraw the appeal. If practicable, counsel

who represented the accused at the court-martial shall be detailed.

#### (4) Civilian counsel.

Whether or not the accused was represented by civilian counsel at

expense to the United States, concerning whether to waive or withdraw appellate

review.

#### (5) Record of trial.

Any defense counsel with whom the accused consults under this rule

 shall be given reasonable opportunity to examine the record of trial.

##### Discussion

Ordinarily counsel may use the accused's copy of the record. If

this is not possible, as when the accused and counsel are physically separated,

another copy should be made available to counsel.

#### (6) Consult.

The right to consult with counsel, as used in this rule, does not

 require communication in the presence of one another.

### (c) Compulsion, coercion, inducement prohibited.

No person may compel, coerce, or induce an accused by force, promises

 of clemency, or otherwise to waive or withdraw appellate review.

### (d) Form of waiver or withdrawal.

A waiver or withdrawal of appellate review shall:

(1) Be written;

(2) State that the accused and defense counsel have discussed the accused's

right to appellate review and the effect of waiver or withdrawal of appellate

review and that the accused understands these matters;

(3) State that the waiver or withdrawal is submitted voluntarily; and

(4) Be signed by the accused and by defense counsel.

Action on a withdrawal of appellate review shall be carried out

in accordance with procedures established by the Judge Advocate General,

or if the case is pending before a Court of Criminal Appeals, in accordance

with the rules of such court. If the appeal is withdrawn, the Judge Advocate

General shall forward the record to an appropriate authority for compliance

with R.C.M. 1112.

#### (4) Substantial compliance required.

A purported waiver or withdrawal of an appeal which does not substantially

comply with this rule shall have no effect.

## Rule 1111. Disposition of the record of trial after action

### (a) General courts-martial.

#### (1) Cases forwarded to the Judge Advocate General.

A record of trial by general court-martial and the convening authority's

#### (2) Cases forwarded to a judge advocate.

A record of trial by general court-martial and the convening authority's

action shall be sent directly to a judge advocate for review under R.C.M.

 forwarded with the original record of trial.

### (b) Special courts-martial.

#### (1) Cases including an approved bad-conduct discharge or confinement for

The record of trial by a special court-martial in which the approved

 sentence does not include a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one

year shall be forwarded directly to a judge advocate for review under R.C.M.

1112. Four copies of the order promulgating the result of trial shall be

not include a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year; and

(3) Each summary court-martial.

###### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113 concerning when the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction may order parts of the sentence executed. _

See_ R.C.M. 1114 concerning orders promulgating the action of the

officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction. _See also_

Appendix 16 (Forms for actions) and Appendix 17 (Forms for court-martial

If the judge advocate who reviews the case under this rule states

 that corrective action is required as a matter of law, and the officer exercising

record of trial and the action thereon shall be forwarded to the Judge Advocate

General concerned for review under R.C.M. 1201(b)(2).

#### (2) Sentence including dismissal.

If the approved sentence includes dismissal, the record shall be

##### Discussion

A dismissal may not be ordered executed until approved by the Secretary

or the Secretary's designee. _See_ R.C.M. 1206.

#### (3) Other records.

Records reviewed under this rule which are not forwarded under

subsection (g)(1) of this rule shall be disposed of as prescribed by the

Secretary concerned.

##### Discussion

A dismissal may not be ordered executed until approved by the Secretary

or the Secretary's designee under R.C.M. 1206.

## Rule 1113. Execution of sentences

### (a) In general.

No sentence of a court-martial may be executed unless it has been

 approved by the convening authority.

#### Discussion

An order executing the sentence directs that the sentence be carried

 out. Except as provided in subsections (d)(2), (3), and (5) of this rule,

no part of a sentence may be carried out until it is ordered executed.

### (b) Punishments which the convening authority may order executed in the

 initial action.

Except as provided in subsection (c) of this rule, the convening

 authority may order all or part of the sentence of a court-martial executed

 when the convening authority takes initial action under R.C.M. 1107.

### (c) Punishments which the convening authority may not order executed in

the initial action.

#### (1) Dishonorable or a bad-conduct discharge.

Except as may otherwise be prescribed by the Secretary concerned,

a dishonorable or a bad-conduct discharge may be ordered executed only by:

(A) The officer who reviews the case under R.C.M. 1112(f), as part of

the action approving the sentence, except when that action must be forwarded

under R.C.M. 1112(g)(1); or

(B) The officer then exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over

 the accused.

A dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge may be ordered

executed only after a final judgment within the meaning of R.C.M. 1209 has

been rendered in the case. If on the date of final judgment a servicemember

is not on appellate leave and more than 6 months have elapsed since approval

 of the sentence by the convening authority, before a dishonorable or a bad-conduct

discharge may be executed, the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction

over the servicemember shall consider the advice of that officer's staff

judge advocate as to whether retention of the servicemember would be in the

best interest of the service. Such advice shall include the findings and

sentence as finally approved, the nature and character of duty since approval

of the sentence by the convening authority, and a recommendation whether

the discharge should be executed.

#### (2) Dismissal of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman.

Dismissal of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman may be

 approved and ordered executed only by the Secretary concerned or such Under

 Secretary or Assistant Secretary as the Secretary concerned may designate.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1206(a) concerning approval by the

Secretary.

#### (3) Sentences extending to death.

A punishment of death may be ordered executed only by the President.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1207 concerning approval by the President.

### (d) Self-executing punishments.

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge that has been approved by an appropriate convening authority may be self-executing after final judgment at such time as:

(1) The accused has received a sentence of no confinement or has completed all confinement;

(2) The accused has been placed on excess or appellate leave; and,

(3) The appropriate official has certified that the accused's case is final.  Upon completion of the certification, the official shall forward the certification to the accused's personnel office for preparation of a final discharge order and certificate.

### (e) Other considerations concerning the execution of certain sentences.

#### (1) Death.

##### (A) Manner carried out.

A sentence to death which has been finally ordered executed shall

be carried out in the manner prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

##### (B) Action when accused lacks mental capacity.

An accused lacking the mental capacity to understand the punishment

 to be suffered or the reason for imposition of the death sentence may not

be put to death during any period when such incapacity exists. The accused

is presumed to have such mental capacity. If a substantial question is raised

as to whether the accused lacks capacity, the convening authority then exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the accused shall order a hearing

on the question. A military judge, counsel for the government, and counsel

for the accused shall be detailed. The convening authority shall direct an

 examination of the accused in accordance with R.C.M. 706, but the examination

 may be limited to determining whether the accused understands the punishment

to be suffered and the reason therefore. The military judge shall consider

all evidence presented, including evidence provided by the accused. The accused

has the burden of proving such lack of capacity by a preponderance of the

evidence. The military judge shall make findings of fact, which will then

be forwarded to the convening authority ordering the hearing. If the accused

is found to lack capacity, the convening authority shall stay the execution

until the accused regains appropriate capacity.

###### Discussion

A verbatim transcript of the hearing should accompany the findings

of fact.

#### (2) Confinement.

##### (A) Effective date of confinement.

Any period of confinement included in the sentence of a court-martial

 begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial,

but the following shall be excluded in computing the service of the term

of confinement:

(i) Periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or

 deferred;

(ii) Periods during which the accused is in custody of civilian authorities

under Article 14 from the time of the delivery to the return to military

custody, if the accused was convicted in the civilian court;

(iii) Periods during which the accused is in custody of civilian or foreign authorities after the convening authority, pursuant to Article 57a.(b)(1), has postponed the service of a sentence to confinement.

####### Discussion

The convening authority's decision to postpone service of a court-martial

sentence to confinement normally should be reflected in the action.

(iv) Periods during which the accused has escaped or is absent without

 authority, or is absent under a parole which proper authority has later

revoked, or is erroneously released from confinement through misrepresentation

or fraud on the part of the prisoner, or is erroneously released from confinement

upon the prisoner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus under a court order

which is later reversed; and

(v) Periods during which another sentence by court-martial to confinement

 is being served. When a prisoner serving a court-martial sentence to confinement

is later convicted by a court-martial of another offense and sentenced to

confinement, the later sentence interrupts the running of the earlier sentence.

Any unremitted remaining portion of the earlier sentence will be served after

the later sentence is fully executed.

##### (B) Nature of the confinement.

The omission of "hard labor" from any sentence of a

 court-martial which has adjudged confinement shall not prohibit the authority

who orders the sentence executed from requiring hard labor as part of the

punishment.

##### (C) Place of confinement.

The authority who orders a sentence to confinement into execution

 shall designate the place of confinement under regulations prescribed by

the Secretary concerned, unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned.

 Under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, a sentence

to confinement adjudged by a court-martial or other military tribunal, regardless

whether the sentence includes a punitive discharge or dismissal and regardless

whether the punitive discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be ordered

to be served in any place of confinement under the control of any of the

armed forces or in any penal or correctional institution under the control

of the United States or which the United States may be allowed to use. Persons

 so confined in a penal or correctional institution not under the control

of one of the armed forces are subject to the same discipline and treatment

as persons confined or committed by the courts of the United States or of

the State, Territory, District of Columbia, or place in which the institution

is situated. When the service of a sentence to confinement has been deferred

and the deferment is later rescinded, the convening authority shall designate

the place of confinement in the initial action on the sentence or in the

order rescinding the deferment. No member of the armed forces, or person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, may be placed in confinement in immediate association with enemy prisoners or with other foreign nationals not subject to the code.  The Secretary concerned may prescribe regulations governing the place and conditions of confinement.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1101(c) concerning deferment of a sentence

to confinement.

#### (3) Confinement in lieu of fine.

Confinement may not be executed for failure to pay a fine if the

 accused demonstrates that the accused has made good faith efforts to pay

but cannot because of indigency, unless the authority considering imposition

of confinement determines, after giving the accused notice and opportunity

to be heard, that there is no other punishment adequate to meet the Government's

interest in appropriate punishment.

#### (4) Restriction; hard labor without confinement.

When restriction and hard labor without confinement are included

in the same sentence, they shall, unless one is suspended, be executed concurrently.

#### (5) More than one sentence.

If at the time forfeitures may be ordered executed, the accused

is already serving a sentence to forfeitures by another court-martial, the

authority taking action may order that the later forfeitures will be executed

when the earlier sentence to forfeitures is completed.

## Rule 1114. Promulgating orders

### (a) In general.

#### (1) Scope of rule.

Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, orders

promulgating the result of trial and the actions of the convening or higher

authorities on the record shall be prepared, issued, and distributed as

prescribed in this rule.

#### (2) Purpose.

A promulgating order publishes the result of the court-martial and

 the convening authority's action and any later action taken on the case.

#### (3) Summary courts-martial.

An order promulgating the result of a trial by summary court-martial

 need not be issued.

##### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1306(b)(2) concerning summary courts-martial.

#### (4) Self-executing final orders.

An order promulgating a self-executing dishonorable or bad conduct discharge need not be issued.  The original action by a convening authority approving a discharge and certification by the appropriate official that the case is final may be forwarded to the accused's personnel office for preparation of a discharge order and certificate.

### (b) By whom issued.

#### (1) Initial orders.

The order promulgating the result of trial and the initial action

of the convening authority shall be issued by the convening authority.

#### (2) Orders issued after the initial action.

Any action taken on the case subsequent to the initial action shall

 be promulgated in supplementary orders. The subsequent action and the supplementary

order may be the same document if signed personally by the appropriate convening

or higher authority.

##### (A) When the President or the Secretary concerned has taken final action.

General court-martial orders publishing the final result in cases

in which the President or the Secretary concerned has taken final action

shall be promulgated as prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned.

##### (B) Other cases.

In cases other than those in subsection (b)(2)(A) of this rule,

the final action may be promulgated by an appropriate convening authority.

### (c) Contents.

#### (1) In general.

The order promulgating the initial action shall set forth: the type

 of court-martial and the command by which it was convened; the charges and

specifications, or a summary thereof, on which the accused was arraigned;

the accused's pleas; the findings or other disposition of each charge and

specification; the sentence, if any; and the action of the convening authority,

or a summary thereof. Supplementary orders shall recite, verbatim, the action

or order of the appropriate authority, or a summary thereof.

#### (2) Dates.

A promulgating order shall bear the date of the initial action,

if any, of the convening authority. An order promulgating an acquittal,

a court-martial terminated before findings, a court-martial resulting in

a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility of

 all charges and specifications, or action on the findings or sentence taken

after the initial action of the convening authority shall bear the date

of its publication. A promulgating order shall state the date the sentence

was adjudged, the date on which the acquittal was announced, or the date

on which the proceedings were otherwise terminated.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 17 for sample forms for promulgating

 orders.

#### (3) Order promulgated regardless of the result of trial or nature of the

 action.

An order promulgating the result of trial by general or special

 court-martial shall be issued regardless of the result and regardless of

the action of the convening or higher authorities.

### (d) Orders containing classified information.

When an order contains information which must be classified, only

the order retained in the unit files and those copies which accompany the

record of trial shall be complete and contain the classified information.

The order shall be assigned the appropriate security classification. Asterisks

shall be substituted for the classified information in the other copies of

the order.

### (e) Authentication.

The promulgating order shall be authenticated by the signature of

the convening or other competent authority acting on the case, or a person

acting under the direction of such authority. A promulgating order prepared

in compliance with this rule shall be presumed authentic.

### (f) Distribution.

Promulgating orders shall be distributed as provided in regulations

 of the Secretary concerned.

(A) The sentence, as approved, extends to dismissal of a commissioned

 officer, cadet, or midshipman, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or

confinement for 1 year or longer; and

(B) The accused has not waived or withdrawn appellate review.

###### Discussion

_ See_ R.C.M. 1110 concerning waiver or withdrawal

of appellate review.

and the powers and responsibilities of the Judge Advocate General after such

review. _See_ R.C.M. 1202 concerning appellate counsel.

### (b) Cases reviewed by the Judge Advocate General.

#### (1) Mandatory examination of certain general courts-martial.

or withdrawn such review, the record of trial by a general court-martial

in which there has been a finding of guilty and a sentence, the appellate

 review of which is not provided for in subsection (a) of this rule, shall

be examined in the office of the Judge Advocate General. If any part of

the findings or sentence is found unsupported in law, or if reassessment

 of the sentence is appropriate, the Judge Advocate General may modify or

set aside the findings or sentence or both. If the Judge Advocate General

so directs, the record shall be reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals

in accordance with R.C.M. 1203. If the case is forwarded to a Court of Criminal

Appeals, the accused shall be informed and shall have the rights under R.C.M.

#### (2) Mandatory review of cases forwarded under R.C.M. 1112(g)(1).

The Judge Advocate General shall review each case forwarded under

 R.C.M. 1112(g)(1). On such review, the Judge Advocate General may vacate

or modify, in whole or part, the findings or sentence, or both, of a court-martial

lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to

the substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the sentence.

#### (3) Review by the Judge Advocate General after final review.

##### (A) In general.

Notwithstanding R.C.M. 1209, the Judge Advocate General may,_

 sua sponte_ or upon application of the accused or a person with

authority to act for the accused, vacate or modify, in whole or in part,

the findings, sentence, or both of a court-martial which has been finally

reviewed, but has not been reviewed either by a Court of Criminal Appeals

or by the Judge Advocate General under subsection (b)(1) of this rule, on

the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court-martial, lack

of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to the

 substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the sentence.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1210 concerning petition for new trial.

 Review of a case by a Judge Advocate General under this subsection is not

part of appellate review within the meaning of Article 76 or R.C.M. 1209.

  Review

of a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility

under this rule may not extend to the determination of lack of mental responsibility.

 Thus, modification of a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental

 responsibility under this rule is limited to changing the finding to not

guilty or not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility of a

 lesser included offense.

##### (B) Procedure.

Each Judge Advocate General shall provide procedures for considering

 all cases properly submitted under subsection (b)(3) of this rule and may

 prescribe the manner by which an application for relief under subsection

(b)(3) of this rule may be made and, if submitted by a person other than

the accused, may require that the applicant show authority to act on behalf

of the accused.

###### Discussion

_See_ R.C.M. 1114 concerning orders promulgating

 action under this rule.

##### (C) Time limits on applications.

Any application for review by the Judge Advocate General under

Article 69 must be made on or before the last day of the two year period

beginning on the date the sentence is approved by the convening authority

or the date the findings are announced for cases which do not proceed to

 sentencing, unless the accused establishes good cause for failure to file

 within that time.

#### (4) Rehearing.

If the Judge Advocate General sets aside the findings or sentence,

 the Judge Advocate General may, except when the setting aside is based on

lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order

a rehearing. If the Judge Advocate General sets aside the findings and sentence

and does not order a rehearing, the Judge Advocate General shall order that

the charges be dismissed. If the Judge Advocate General orders a rehearing

but the convening authority finds a rehearing impractical, the convening

authority shall dismiss the charges.

### (c) Remission and suspension.

The Judge Advocate General may, when so authorized by the Secretary

 concerned under Article 74, at any time remit or suspend the unexecuted part

of any sentence, other than a sentence approved by the President.

## Rule 1202. Appellate counsel

### (a) In general.

The Judge Advocate General concerned shall detail one or more commissioned

officers as appellate Government counsel and one or more commissioned officers

as appellate defense counsel who are qualified under Article 27(b)(1).

### (b) Duties.

#### (1) Appellate Government counsel.

Appellate Government counsel shall represent the United States before

 the Court of Criminal Appeals or the United States Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces when directed to do so by the Judge Advocate General concerned.

Appellate Government counsel may represent the United States before the United

States Supreme Court when requested to do so by the Attorney General.

#### (2) Appellate defense counsel.

Appellate defense counsel shall represent the accused before the

 Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or

the Supreme Court when the accused is a party in the case before such court

and:

(A) The accused requests to be represented by appellate defense counsel;

(B) The United States is represented by counsel; or

(C) The Judge Advocate General has sent the case to the United States

 Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Appellate defense counsel is authorized

to communicate directly with the accused. The accused is a party in the

case when named as a party in pleadings before the court or, even if not

so named, when the military judge is named as respondent in a petition by

the Government for extraordinary relief from a ruling in favor of the accused

at trial.

###### Discussion

For a discussion of the duties of the trial defense counsel concerning

post-trial and appellate matters, _see_ R.C.M. 502(d)(6) Discussion

(E). Appellate defense counsel may communicate with trial defense counsel

concerning the case. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 502 (privileges).

  If

all or part of the findings and sentence are affirmed by the Court of Criminal

Appeals, appellate defense counsel should advise the accused whether the

accused should petition for further review in the United States Court of

Appeals for the Armed Forces and concerning which issues should be raised.

  The

accused may be represented by civilian counsel before the Court of Criminal

Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and the Supreme Court.

Such counsel will not be provided at the expense of the United States. Civilian

counsel may represent the accused before these courts in addition to or

instead of military counsel.

  If, after any decision of the

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the accused may apply for a writ

of certiorari (_see_ R.C.M. 1205), appellate defense counsel

should advise the accused whether to apply for review by the Supreme Court

and which issues might be raised. If authorized to do so by the accused,

appellate defense counsel may prepare and file a petition for a writ of certiorari

on behalf of the accused.

  The accused has no right to select

appellate defense counsel. Under some circumstances, however, the accused

may be entitled to request that the detailed appellate defense counsel be

replaced by another appellate defense counsel.

  _

See also_ R.C.M. 1204(b)(1) concerning detailing counsel with respect

to the right to petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review.

## Rule 1203. Review by a Court of Criminal Appeals

### (a) In general.

Each Judge Advocate General shall establish a Court of Criminal

 Appeals composed of appellate military judges.

#### Discussion

 _See_ Article 66 concerning the composition of the

Courts of Criminal Appeals, the qualifications of appellate military judges,

the grounds for their ineligibility, and restrictions upon the official

relationship of the members of the court to other members. Uniform rules

of court for the Courts of Criminal Appeals are prescribed by the Judge Advocates

General.

### (b) Cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals.

A Court of Criminal Appeals shall review cases referred to it by

the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(a) or (b)(1).

#### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1110 concerning withdrawal of a case

pending before a Court of Criminal Appeals.

  _See

_ R.C.M. 908 concerning procedures for interlocutory appeals by the

Government.

  In cases referred to it under R.C.M. 1201, a

Court of Criminal Appeals may act only with respect to the findings and

sentence as approved by proper authority. It may affirm only such findings

 of guilty or such part of a finding of guilty as includes an included offense,

 as it finds correct in law and fact and determines on the basis of the entire

record should be approved. A Court of Criminal Appeals has generally the

same powers as the convening authority to modify a sentence (_see

_ R.C.M. 1107), but it may not suspend all or part of a sentence.

However, it may reduce the period of a suspension prescribed by a convening

authority. It may not defer service of a sentence to confinement. (_

see_ R.C.M. 1101(c)). It may, however, review a decision by a convening

authority concerning deferral, to determine whether that decision was an

abuse of the convening authority's discretion.

  In considering

the record of a case referred to it under R.C.M. 1201, a Court of Criminal

 Appeals may weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and

determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the court-martial

saw and heard the evidence. A finding or sentence of a court-martial may

not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially

prejudices the substantial rights of the accused. Article 59(a).

  If

a Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside any findings of guilty or the sentence,

it may, except as to findings set aside for lack of sufficient evidence in

the record to support the findings, order an appropriate type of rehearing

or reassess the sentence as appropriate. _See_ R.C.M. 810

 concerning rehearings. If the Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside all the

 findings and the sentence and does not order a rehearing, it must order

the charges dismissed. _ See_ Articles 59(a) and 66.

  A

Court of Criminal Appeals may on petition for extraordinary relief issue

all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction and agreeable

to the usages and principles of law. Any party may petition a Court of Criminal

Appeals for extraordinary relief.

### (c) Action on cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals.

#### (1) Forwarding by the Judge Advocate General to the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces.

The Judge Advocate General may forward the decision of the Court

of Criminal Appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review

with respect to any matter of law. In such a case, the Judge Advocate General

shall cause a copy of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals and the

order forwarding the case to be served on the accused and on appellate defense

counsel. While a review of a forwarded case is pending, the Secretary concerned

may defer further service of a sentence to confinement that has been ordered

executed in such a case.

#### (2) Action when sentence is set aside.

In a case reviewed by it under this rule in which the Court of

Criminal Appeals has set aside the sentence and which is not forwarded to

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces under subsection (c)(1) of this

rule, the Judge Advocate General shall instruct an appropriate convening

authority to take action in accordance with the decision of the Court of

Criminal Appeals. If the Court of Criminal Appeals has ordered a rehearing,

the record shall be sent to an appropriate convening authority. If that convening

authority finds a rehearing impracticable that convening authority may dismiss

the charges.

##### Discussion

If charges are dismissed, _see_ R.C.M. 1208 concerning

 restoration of rights, privileges, and property. _See_ R.C.M.

1114 concerning promulgating orders.

#### (3) Action when sentence is affirmed in whole or part.

##### (A) Sentence requiring approval by the President.

If the Court of Criminal Appeals affirms any sentence which includes

 death, the Judge Advocate General shall transmit the record of trial and

the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals directly to the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces when any period for reconsideration provided by the

rules of the Courts of Criminal Appeals has expired.

##### (B) Other cases.

If the Court of Criminal Appeals affirms any sentence other than

one which includes death, the Judge Advocate General shall cause a copy

of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals to be served on the accused

in accordance with subsection (d) of this rule.

#### (4) Remission or suspension.

If the Judge Advocate General believes that a sentence as affirmed

by the Court of Criminal Appeals, other than one which includes death, should

be remitted or suspended in whole or part, the Judge Advocate General may,

before taking action under subsections (c)(1) or (3) of this rule, transmit

the record of trial and the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals to

the secretary concerned with a recommendation for action under Article 74

or may take such action as may be authorized by the Secretary concerned under

Article 74(a).

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1201(c); 1206.

#### (5) Action when accused lacks mental capacity.

An appellate authority may not affirm the proceedings while the

 accused lacks mental capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate

intelligently in the appellate proceedings. In the absence of substantial

 evidence to the contrary, the accused is presumed to have the capacity to

 understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the appellate proceedings.

If a substantial question is raised as to the requisite mental capacity

of the accused, the appellate authority may direct that the record be forwarded

to an appropriate authority for an examination of the accused in accordance

with R.C.M. 706, but the examination may be limited to determining the accused's

present capacity to understand and cooperate in the appellate proceedings.

The order of the appellate authority will instruct the appropriate authority

as to permissible actions that may be taken to dispose of the matter. If

the record is thereafter returned to the appellate authority, the appellate

authority may affirm part or all of the findings or sentence unless it is

established, by a preponderance of the evidence-including matters

outside the record of trial-that the accused does not have the requisite

 mental capacity. If the accused does not have the requisite mental capacity,

 the appellate authority shall stay the proceedings until the accused regains

appropriate capacity, or take other appropriate action. Nothing in this

subsection shall prohibit the appellate authority from making a determination

in favor of the accused which will result in the setting aside of a conviction.

### (d) Notification to accused.

#### (1) Notification of decision.

The accused shall be notified of the decision of the Court of Criminal

Appeals in accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.

##### Discussion

The accused may be notified personally, or a copy of the decision

may be sent, after service on appellate counsel of record, if any, by first

class certified mail to the accused at an address provided by the accused

or, if no such address has been provided by the accused, at the latest address

listed for the accused in the accused's official service record.

  If

the Judge Advocate General has forwarded the case to the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces, the accused should be so notified. _See_

subsection (c)(1) of this rule.

#### (2) Notification of right to petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed

 Forces for review.

If the accused has the right to petition the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces for review, the accused shall be provided with a copy of

the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals bearing an endorsement notifying

the accused of this right. The endorsement shall inform the accused that

such a petition:

(A) May be filed only within 60 days from the time the accused was in

 fact notified of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals or the mailed

copy of the decision was postmarked, whichever is earlier; and

(B) May be forwarded through the officer immediately exercising general

 court-martial jurisdiction over the accused and through the appropriate

Judge Advocate General or filed directly with the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces.

###### Discussion

 _See_ Article 67(c).

  _

See also_ R.C.M. 1204(b).

  The accused may petition

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review, as to any matter of

law, of any decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals except: (1) a case

which was referred to the Court of Criminal Appeals by the Judge Advocate

General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1); (2) a case in which the Court of Criminal

Appeals has set aside the sentence; and (3) a case in which the sentence

includes death (because review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

is mandatory).

  The placing of a petition for review in proper

military channels divests the Court of Criminal Appeals of jurisdiction

over the case, and jurisdiction is thereby conferred on the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces. _See_ R.C.M. 1113 concerning action

to be taken if the accused does not file or the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces denies a petition for review.

#### (3) Receipt by the accused-disposition.

When the accused has the right to petition the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces for review, the receipt of the accused for the copy

of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals, a certificate of service

on the accused, or the postal receipt for delivery of certified mail shall

be transmitted in duplicate by expeditious means to the appropriate Judge

Advocate General. If the accused is personally served, the receipt or certificate

of service shall show the date of service. The Judge Advocate General shall

forward one copy of the receipt, certificate, or postal receipt to the clerk

of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces when required by the court.

### (e) Cases not reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

If the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals is not subject

to review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or if the Judge

Advocate General has not forwarded the case to the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces and the accused has not filed or the Court of Appeals for

 the Armed Forces has denied a petition for review, the Judge Advocate General

shall-

(1) If the sentence affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals includes

a dismissal, transmit the record, the decision of the Court of Criminal

Appeals, and the Judge Advocate General's recommendation to the Secretary

concerned for action under R.C.M. 1206; or

(2) If the sentence affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals does not

 include a dismissal, notify the convening authority, the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the accused, or the Secretary concerned,

 as appropriate, who, subject to R.C.M. 1113(c)(1), may order into execution

 any unexecuted sentence affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals or take

other action, as authorized.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113, 1206, and Article 74(a) concerning

the authority of the Secretary and others to take action.

### (f) Scope.

 General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review;

and

(3) Reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals, except those referred to

it by the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1), in which, upon

petition by the accused and on good cause shown, the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces has granted a review.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Article 67(a) concerning the composition of

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. In any case reviewed by it, the

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may act only with respect to the findings

and sentence as approved by the convening authority and as affirmed or set

aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal Appeals. _See_ Article

67(d) and (e). The rules of practice and procedure before the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces are published in the Military Justice Reporter.

  The

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may entertain petitions for extraordinary

relief and may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction

 and agreeable to the usages and principles of law. Any party may petition

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for extraordinary relief. However,

in the interest of judicial economy, such petitions usually should be filed

with and adjudicated before the appropriate Court of Criminal Appeals prior

to submission to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

### (b) Petition by the accused for review by the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces.

#### (1) Counsel.

When the accused is notified of the right to forward a petition

for review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, if requested by

the accused, associate counsel qualified under R.C.M. 502(d)(1) shall be

detailed to advise and assist the accused in connection with preparing a

petition for further appellate review.

##### Discussion

If reasonably available, the counsel who conducted the defense at

 trial may perform these duties. The counsel detailed to represent the accused

should communicate with the appellate defense counsel representing the accused. _

See_ R.C.M. 1202.

The accused shall file any petition for review by the Court of

Appeals for the Armed Forces under subsection (a)(3) of this rule directly

notifying the accused of the right to petition the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces for review and the time limits for submitting a petition. _

See also_ the rules of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

concerning when the time for filing a petition begins to run and when a petition

is now timely.

### (c) Action on decision by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

#### (1) In general.

After it has acted on a case, the Court of Appeals for the Armed

 Forces may direct the Judge Advocate General to return the record to the

Court of Criminal Appeals for further proceedings in accordance with the

decision of the court. Otherwise, unless the decision is subject to review

 by the Supreme Court, or there is to be further action by the President

or the Secretary concerned, the Judge Advocate General shall instruct the

convening authority to take action in accordance with that decision. If the

Court has ordered a rehearing, but the convening authority to whom the record

is transmitted finds a rehearing impracticable, the convening authority

may dismiss the charges.

##### Discussion

the Judge Advocate General shall follow the procedure in R.C.M. 1203(e)(1).

##### Discussion

 _See_ Article 71(b) and R.C.M. 1206.

#### (4) Decision subject to review by the Supreme Court.

If the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is

 subject to review by the Supreme Court, the Judge Advocate General shall

take no action under subsections (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this rule until:

(A) the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme

Court has expired; or (B) the Supreme Court has denied any petitions for

writ of certiorari filed in the case. After (A) or (B) has occurred, the

Judge Advocate General shall take action under subsection (c)(1), (2), or

(3). If the Supreme Court grants a writ of certiorari, the Judge Advocate

1110.

(2) In cases not reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals-

(A) The findings and sentence have been found legally sufficient by

a judge advocate and, when action by such officer is required, have been

The appellate review of records of trial provided by the code, the

 proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed,

 or affirmed as required by the code, and all dismissals and discharges carried

into execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval, review,

or affirmation as required by the code, are final and conclusive. Orders

publishing the proceedings of courts-martial and all action taken pursuant

to those proceedings are binding upon all departments, courts, agencies,

and officers of the United States, subject only to action upon a petition

for a new trial under Article 73, to action by the Judge Advocate General

under Article 69(b), to action by the Secretary concerned as provided in

Article 74, and the authority of the President.

## Rule 1210. New trial

At any time within 2 years after approval by the convening authority

 of a court-martial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge Advocate

 General for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence or fraud

on the court-martial. A petition may not be submitted after the death of

the accused. A petition for a new trial of the facts may not be submitted

 on the basis of newly discovered evidence when the petitioner was found

guilty of the relevant offense pursuant to a guilty plea.

A petition for a new trial may be submitted by the accused personally,

or by accused's counsel, regardless whether the accused has been separated

from the service.

of attorney of the accused for that purpose, or by a person with the authorization

of an appropriate court to sign the petition as the representative of the

accused. The petition shall contain the following information, or an explanation

why such matters are not included:

### (e) Who may act on petition.

If the accused's case is pending before a Court of Criminal Appeals

 or the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the Judge Advocate General

shall refer the petition to the appropriate court for action. Otherwise,

the Judge Advocate General of the armed force which reviewed the previous

trial shall act on the petition, except that petitions submitted by persons

who, at the time of trial and sentence from which the petitioner seeks relief,

were members of the Coast Guard, and who, and who were members of the Coast

Guard at the time the petition is submitted, shall be acted on in the Department

in which the Coast Guard is serving at the time the petition is so submitted.

### (f) Grounds for new trial.

#### (1) In general.

A new trial may be granted only on grounds of newly discovered

evidence or fraud on the court-martial.

#### (2) Newly discovered evidence.

A new trial shall not be granted on the grounds of newly discovered

 evidence unless the petition shows that:

(A) The evidence was discovered after the trial;

(B) The evidence is not such that it would have been discovered by the

 petitioner at the time of trial in the exercise of due diligence; and

(C) The newly discovered evidence, if considered by a court-martial

in the light of all other pertinent evidence, would probably produce a substantially

more favorable result for the accused.

#### (3) Fraud on court-martial.

No fraud on the court-martial warrants a new trial unless it had

a substantial contributing effect on a finding of guilty or the sentence

 adjudged.

##### Discussion

Examples of fraud on a court-martial which may warrant granting

a new trial are: confessed or proved perjury in testimony or forgery of documentary

 evidence which clearly had a substantial contributing effect on a finding

of guilty and without which there probably would not have been a finding

of guilty of the offense; willful concealment by the prosecution from the

defense of evidence favorable to the defense which, if presented to the court-martial,

 would probably have resulted in a finding of not guilty; and willful concealment

of a material ground for challenge of the military judge or any member or

of the disqualification of counsel or the convening authority, when the basis

for challenge or disqualification was not known to the defense at the time

of trial (_see_ R.C.M. 912).

### (g) Action on the petition.

#### (1) In general.

The authority considering the petition may cause such additional

 investigation to be made and such additional information to be secured as

that authority believes appropriate. Upon written request, and in its discretion,

the authority considering the petition may permit oral argument on the matter.

#### (2) Courts of Criminal Appeals; Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

The Courts of Criminal Appeals and the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces shall act on a petition for a new trial in accordance with their

 respective rules.

#### (3) The Judge Advocates General.

When a petition is considered by the Judge Advocate General, any

 hearing may be before the Judge Advocate General or before an officer or

officers designated by the Judge Advocate General. If the Judge Advocate

 General believes meritorious grounds for relief under Article 74 have been

 established but that a new trial is not appropriate, the Judge Advocate

General may act under Article 74 if authorized to do so, or transmit the

petition and related papers to the Secretary concerned with a recommendation.

The Judge Advocate General may also, in cases which have been finally reviewed

but have not been reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals, act under Article

69.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1201(b)(3).

### (h) Action when new trial is granted.

#### (1) Forwarding to convening authority.

When a petition for a new trial is granted, the Judge Advocate

General shall select and forward the case to a convening authority for disposition.

#### (2) Charges at new trial.

At a new trial, the accused may not be tried for any offense of

which the accused was found not guilty or upon which the accused was not

tried at the earlier court-martial.

##### Discussion

 _See also_ R.C.M. 810 concerning additional special

rules which apply at a new trial. In other respects a new trial is conducted

like any other court-martial.

#### (3) Action by convening authority.

The convening authority's action on the record of a new trial is

the same as in other courts-martial.

#### (4) Disposition of record.

The disposition of the record of a new trial is the same as for

other courts-martial.

#### (5) Court-martial orders.

Court-martial orders promulgating the final action taken as a result

 of a new trial, including any restoration of rights, privileges, and property,

shall be promulgated in accordance with R.C.M. 1114.

##### Discussion

 _See_ Article 75 and R.C.M. 1208 concerning restoration

of rights when the executed portion of a sentence is not sustained in a

new trial or action following it.

#### (6) Action by persons charged with execution of the sentence.

Persons charged with the administrative duty of executing a sentence

 adjudged upon a new trial after it has been ordered executed shall credit

the accused with any executed portion or amount of the original sentence

included in the new sentence in computing the term or amount of punishment

actually to be executed pursuant to the sentence.

# CHAPTER XIII. SUMMARY COURTS-MARTIAL

## Rule 1301. Summary courts-martial generally

### (a) Composition.

A summary court-martial is composed of one commissioned officer

on active duty. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned a

summary court-martial shall be of the same armed force as the accused. Summary courts-martial shall be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the military service to which the accused belongs. Whenever practicable, a summary court-martial should be an officer whose grade is

not below lieutenant of the Navy or Coast Guard or captain of the Army,

Air Force, or Marine Corps. When only one commissioned officer is present

 with a command or detachment, that officer shall be the summary court-martial

 of that command or detachment. When more than one commissioned officer is

present with a command or detachment, the convening authority may not be

the summary court-martial of that command or detachment.

### (b) Function.

The function of the summary court-martial is to promptly adjudicate

 minor offenses under a simple procedure. The summary court-martial shall

thoroughly and impartially inquire into both sides of the matter and shall

ensure that the interests of both the Government and the accused are safeguarded

and that justice is done. A summary court-martial may seek advice from a

judge advocate or legal officer on questions of law, but the summary court-martial

may not seek advice from any person on factual conclusions which should be

drawn from evidence or the sentence which should be imposed, as the summary

 court-martial has the independent duty to make these determinations.

#### Discussion

For a definition of "minor offenses," _see_

paragraph 1e, Part V.

### (c) Jurisdiction.

**[Note: R.C.M. 1301(c) applies to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.]**

(1) Subject to Chapter II, summary courts-martial have the power to

try persons subject to the code, except commissioned officers, warrant officers,

cadets, aviation cadets, and midshipmen, for any noncapital offense made

punishable by the code.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1) above, summary courts-martial do not have jurisdiction over offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), 120b(b), forcible sodomy under Article 125, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ. Such offenses shall not be referred to a summary court-martial.

##### Discussion

 Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, only a general court-martial has jurisdiction to try penetrative sex offenses under subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120, subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120b, Article 125, and attempts to commit such penetrative sex offenses under Article 80, UCMJ.

##### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 103(3) for a definition of capital

 offenses.

### (d) Punishments.

#### (1) Limitations-amount.

Subject to R.C.M. 1003, summary courts-martial may adjudge any

punishment not forbidden by the code except death, dismissal, dishonorable

or bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than 1 month, hard labor

without confinement for more than 45 days, restriction to specified limits

for more than 2 months, or forfeiture of more than two-thirds of 1 month's

pay.

##### Discussion

The maximum penalty which can be adjudged in a summary court-martial

 is confinement for 30 days, forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for one

month, and reduction to the lowest pay grade. _See_ subsection

(2) below for additional limits on enlisted persons serving in pay grades

above the fourth enlisted pay grade.

  A summary court-martial

may not suspend all or part of a sentence, although the summary court-martial

may recommend to the convening authority that all or part of a sentence be

suspended. If a sentence includes both reduction in grade and forfeitures,

the maximum forfeiture is calculated at the reduced pay grade. _See

also_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning other punishments which may be adjudged,

the effects of certain types of punishment, and combination of certain types

of punishment. The summary court-martial should ascertain the effect of

Article 58a in that armed force.

#### (2) Limitations-pay grade.

In the case of enlisted members above the fourth enlisted pay grade,

 summary courts-martial may not adjudge confinement, hard labor without confinement,

or reduction except to the next pay grade.

##### Discussion

The provisions of this subsection apply to an accused in the fifth

 enlisted pay grade who is reduced to the fourth enlisted pay grade by the

summary court-martial.

### (e) Counsel.

The accused at a summary court-martial does not have the right to

 counsel. If the accused has civilian counsel provided by the accused and

qualified under R.C.M. 502(d)(3), that counsel shall be permitted to represent

the accused at the summary court-martial if such appearance will not unreasonably

delay the proceedings and if military exigencies do not preclude it.

#### Discussion

Neither the Constitution nor any statute establishes any right to

 counsel at summary courts-martial. Therefore, it is not error to deny an

accused the opportunity to be represented by counsel at a summary court-martial.

However, appearance of counsel is not prohibited. The detailing authority

 may, as a matter of discretion, detail, or otherwise make available, a military

attorney to represent the accused at a summary court-martial.

### (f) Power to obtain witnesses and evidence.

A summary court-martial may obtain evidence pursuant to R.C.M.

703.

#### Discussion

The summary court-martial must obtain witnesses for the prosecution

 and the defense pursuant to the standards in R.C.M. 703. The summary court-martial

rules on any request by the accused for witnesses or evidence in accordance

with the procedure in R.C.M. 703(c) and (f).

### (g) Secretarial limitations.

The Secretary concerned may prescribe procedural or other rules

for summary courts-martial not inconsistent with this Manual or the code.

## Rule 1302. Convening a summary court-martial

### (a) Who may convene summary courts-martial.

Unless limited by competent authority summary courts-martial may

be convened by:

(1) Any person who may convene a general or special court-martial;

(2) The commander of a detached company or other detachment of the Army;

(3) The commander of a detached squadron or other detachment of the

Air Force;

(4) The commander or officer in charge of any other command when empowered

by the Secretary concerned; or

(5) A superior competent authority to any of the above.

### (b) When convening authority is accuser.

If the convening authority or the summary court-martial is the

accuser, it is discretionary with the convening authority whether to forward

the charges to a superior authority with a recommendation to convene the

summary court-martial. If the convening authority or the summary court-martial

is the accuser, the jurisdiction of the summary court-martial is not affected.

### (c) Procedure.

After the requirements of Chapters III and IV of this Part have

been satisfied, summary courts-martial shall be convened in accordance with

R.C.M. 504(d)(2). The convening order may be by notation signed by the convening

authority on the charge sheet. Charges shall be referred to summary courts-martial

in accordance with R.C.M. 601.

#### Discussion

When the convening authority is the summary court-martial because

the convening authority is the only commissioned officer present with the

command or detachment, _ see_ R.C.M. 1301(a), that fact should

 be noted on the charge sheet.

## Rule 1303. Right to object to trial by summary court-martial

No person who objects thereto before arraignment may be tried by

 summary court-martial even if that person also refused punishment under

Article 15 and demanded trial by court-martial for the same offenses.

### Discussion

If the accused objects to trial by summary court-martial, the convening

authority may dispose of the case in accordance with R.C.M. 401.

## Rule 1304. Trial procedure

### (a) Pretrial duties.

#### (1) Examination of file.

The summary court-martial shall carefully examine the charge sheet,

 allied papers, and immediately available personnel records of the accused

before trial.

##### Discussion

"Personnel records" are those personnel records of the

 accused which are maintained locally and are immediately available. "Allied

papers" in a summary court-martial include convening orders, investigative

reports, correspondence relating to the case, and witness statements.

#### (2) Report of irregularity.

The summary court-martial shall report to the convening authority

any substantial irregularity in the charge sheet, allied papers, or personnel

records.

##### Discussion

The summary court-martial should examine the charge sheet, allied

 papers, and personnel records to ensure that they are complete and free

from errors or omissions which might affect admissibility. The summary court-martial

 should check the charges and specifications to ensure that each alleges

personal jurisdiction over the accused (_see_ R.C.M. 202)

and an offense under the code (_see_ R.C.M. 203 and Part IV).

 Substantial defects or errors in the charges and specifications must be

 reported to the convening authority, since such defects cannot be corrected

except by preferring and referring the affected charge and specification

anew in proper form. A defect or error is substantial if correcting it would

state an offense not otherwise stated, or include an offense, person, or

matter not fairly included in the specification as preferred. _See

_ subsection (3) below concerning minor errors.

#### (3) Correction and amendment.

The summary court-martial may, subject to R.C.M. 603, correct errors

 on the charge sheet and amend charges and specifications. Any such corrections

 or amendments shall be initialed.

### (b) Summary court-martial procedure.



#### Discussion

A sample guide is at Appendix 9. The summary court-martial should

 review and become familiar with the guide used before proceeding.

#### (1) Preliminary proceeding.

After complying with R.C.M. 1304(a), the summary court-martial shall

 hold a preliminary proceeding during which the accused shall be given a copy

of the charge sheet and informed of the following:

(A) The general nature of the charges;

(B) The fact that the charges have been referred to a summary court-martial

for trial and the date of referral;

(C) The identity of the convening authority;

(D) The name(s) of the accuser(s);

(E) The names of the witnesses who could be called to testify and any

 documents or physical evidence which the summary court-martial expects to

introduce into evidence;

(F) The accused's right to inspect the allied papers and immediately

 available personnel records;

(G) That during the trial the summary court-martial will not consider

any matters, including statements previously made by the accused to the

officer detailed as summary court-martial unless admitted in accordance

with the Military Rules of Evidence;

(H) The accused's right to plead not guilty or guilty;

(I) The accused's right to cross-examine witnesses and have the summary

 court-martial cross-examine witnesses on behalf of the accused;

(J) The accused's right to call witnesses and produce evidence with

the assistance of the summary court-martial as necessary;

(K) The accused's right to testify on the merits, or to remain silent

 with the assurance that no adverse inference will be drawn by the summary

court-martial from such silence;

(L) If any findings of guilty are announced, the accused's rights to

 remain silent, to make an unsworn statement, oral or written or both, and

to testify, and to introduce evidence in extenuation or mitigation;

(M) The maximum sentence which the summary court-martial may adjudge

if the accused is found guilty of the offense or offenses alleged; and

(N) The accused's right to object to trial by summary court-martial.

#### (2) Trial proceeding.

##### (A) Objection to trial.

The summary court-martial shall give the accused a reasonable period

 of time to decide whether to object to trial by summary court-martial. The

summary court-martial shall thereafter record the response. If the accused

 objects to trial by summary court-martial, the summary court-martial shall

 return the charge sheet, allied papers, and personnel records to the convening

authority. If the accused fails to object to trial by summary court-martial,

trial shall proceed.

##### (B) Arraignment.

After complying with R.C.M. 1304(b)(1) and (2)(A), the summary

court-martial shall read and show the charges and specifications to the accused

and, if necessary, explain them. The accused may waive the reading of the

charges. The summary court-martial shall then ask the accused to plead to

each specification and charge.

##### (C) Motions.

Before receiving pleas the summary court-martial shall allow the

 accused to make motions to dismiss or for other relief. The summary court-martial

shall take action on behalf of the accused, if requested by the accused,

or if it appears necessary in the interests of justice.

##### (D) Pleas.

###### (i) Not guilty pleas.

When a not guilty plea is entered, the summary court-martial shall

 proceed to trial.

###### (ii) Guilty pleas.

If the accused pleads guilty to any offense, the summary court-martial

shall comply with R.C.M. 910.

###### (iii) Rejected guilty pleas.

If the summary court-martial is in doubt that the accused's pleas

of guilty are voluntarily and understandingly made, or if at any time during

the trial any matter inconsistent with pleas of guilty arises, which inconsistency

 cannot be resolved, the summary court-martial shall enter not guilty pleas

as to the affected charges and specifications.

###### (iv) No plea.

If the accused refuses to plead, the summary court-martial shall

 enter not guilty pleas.

###### (v) Changed pleas.

The accused may change any plea at any time before findings are

 announced. The accused may change pleas from guilty to not guilty after

findings are announced only for good cause.

##### (E) Presentation of evidence.

(i) The Military Rules of Evidence (Part III) apply to summary courts-martial.

(ii) The summary court-martial shall arrange for the attendance of necessary

witnesses for the prosecution and defense, including those requested by the

accused.

####### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 703. Ordinarily witnesses should be

excluded from the courtroom until called to testify. _See_ Mil.

R. Evid. 615.

(iii) Witnesses for the prosecution shall be called first and examined

 under oath. The accused shall be permitted to cross-examine these witnesses.

The summary court-martial shall aid the accused in cross-examination if

such assistance is requested or appears necessary in the interests of justice.

The witnesses for the accused shall then be called and similarly examined

under oath.

(iv) The summary court-martial shall obtain evidence which tends to

disprove the accused's guilt or establishes extenuating circumstances.

####### Discussion

 _See_ R.C.M. 703 and 1001.

##### (F) Findings and sentence.

(i) The summary court-martial shall apply the principles in R.C.M. 918

in determining the findings. The summary court-martial shall announce the

findings to the accused in open session.

(ii) The summary court-martial shall follow the procedures in R.C.M.

1001 and apply the principles in the remainder of Chapter X in determining

a sentence. The summary court-martial shall announce the sentence to the

 accused in open session.

(iii) If the sentence includes confinement, the summary court-martial

shall advise the accused of the right to apply to the convening authority

for deferment of the service of the confinement.

(iv) If the accused is found guilty, the summary court-martial shall

 advise the accused of the rights under R.C.M. 1306(a) and (d) after the

sentence is announced.

(v) The summary court-martial shall, as soon as practicable, inform

the convening authority of the findings, sentence, recommendations, if any,

for suspension of the sentence, and any deferment request.

(vi) If the sentence includes confinement, the summary court-martial

shall cause the delivery of the accused to the accused's commanding officer

or the commanding officer's designee.

####### Discussion

If the accused's immediate commanding officer is not the convening

 authority, the summary court-martial should ensure that the immediate commanding

officer is informed of the findings, sentence, and any recommendations pertaining

thereto. _See_ R.C.M. 1101 concerning post-trial confinement.

## Rule 1305. Record of trial

### (a) In general.

The record of trial of a summary court-martial shall be prepared

as prescribed in subsection (b) of this rule. The convening or higher authority

may prescribe additional requirements for the record of trial.

#### Discussion

 _See_ Appendix 15 for a sample of a Record of Trial

by Summary Court-Martial (DD Form 2329).

  Any petition submitted

under R.C.M. 1306(a) should be appended to the record of trial.

### (b) Contents.

The summary court-martial shall prepare a written record of trial, which shall include:

(1) The pleas, findings, and sentence, and if the accused was represented

(2) The fact that the accused was advised of the matters set forth in

 R.C.M. 1304(b)(1);

(3) If the summary court-martial is the convening authority, a notation

 to that effect.

### (c) Authentication.

The summary court-martial shall authenticate the record by signing the record of trial.  An electronic record of trial may be authenticated with the electronic signature of the summary court-martial.

#### Discussion

"Authentication" means attesting that the record accurately

reports the proceedings. _See_ R.C.M. 1104(a).

### (d) Forwarding copies of the record.

#### (1) Accused's copy.

##### (A) Service.

The summary court-martial shall cause a copy of the record of trial to be served on the accused as soon as it is authenticated.  Service of an authenticated electronic copy of the record of trial with a means to review the record of trial satisfies the requirement of service under this rule.

##### (B) Receipt.

The summary court-martial shall cause the accused's receipt for

the copy of the record of trial to be obtained and attached to the original

record of trial or shall attach to the original record of trial a certificate

that the accused was served a copy of the record. If the record of trial

was not served on the accused personally, the summary court-martial shall

attach a statement explaining how and when such service was accomplished.

If the accused was represented by counsel, such counsel may be served with

the record of trial.

##### (C) Classified information.

If classified information is included in the record of trial of

a summary court-martial, R.C.M. 1104(b)(1)(D) shall apply.

before the period prescribed in R.C.M. 1105(c)(2) has expired, unless the

right to submit matters has been waived under R.C.M. 1105(d).

#### (2) Action.

The action of the convening authority shall be shown on all copies

of the record of trial except that provided the accused if the accused has
