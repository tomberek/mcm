The Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), United States (2012 Edition) updates the MCM (2008 Edition). It is a complete reprinting and incorporates the MCM (2008 Edition), including all amendments to the Rules for Courts-Martial, Military Rules of Evidence (Mil. R. Evid.), and Punitive Articles made by the President in Executive Orders (EO) from 1984 to present, and specifically including EO 13468 (24 July 2008); EO 13552 (31 August 2010); and EO 13593 (13 December 2011). _See_ Appendix 25. This edition also contains amendments to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) made by the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2009 through 2012. Some of the significant changes are summarized and listed below. This summary is for quick reference only and should not be relied upon or cited by practitioners in lieu of the actual provisions of the MCM that have been amended.

The MCM (2012 Edition) includes unique changes warranting attention. Discussion has been added or amended to address changes in practice resulting from _United States v. Campbell_, 71 M.J. 19 (C2.A.A.F. 2012); _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011); and _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)(3); R.C.M. 307(c)(4); R.C.M. 906(b)(12); R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B); R.C.M. 910(a)(1); R.C.M. 918(a)(1); R.C.M. 1003(c)(1)(C); and in Part IV of this Manual, paragraph 3b, paragraph 60c(6)(a), and the discussion at page IV-1. The Discussion added in 2012 was a short-term solution intended to address recent, broad changes in the law. Although it may describe legal requirements derived from other sources, the Discussion does not have the force of law. It is in the nature of a treatise, and may be used as secondary authority. The Discussion will be revised from time to time as warranted by changes in applicable law. _See_ Composition of the Manual for Courts-Martial in Appendix 21 of this Manual.

Practitioners are advised that the Mil. R. Evid. will be amended after the publication of this Manual and will take effect only after the President signs the relevant EO. Once approved, the revised Mil. R. Evid. will exist outside of this Manual until its next complete reprinting.

Practitioners are also advised that Article 120 has been amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Public Law 112-81, 31 December 2011. The amended version of Article 120 creates three separate sexual offense statutes: Article 120 for adult offenses; Article 120b for child offenses; and Article 120c for other sexual offenses. Article 120a remains unchanged. As of 2012, there are now three versions of Article 120, and each version is located in a different part of this Manual.  For offenses committed prior to 1 October 2007, the relevant sexual offense provisions are contained in Appendix 27. For offenses committed during the period 1 October 2007 through 27 June 2012, the relevant sexual offense provisions are contained in Appendix 28. For offenses committed on or after 28 June 2012, the relevant sexual offense provisions are contained in Part IV of this Manual (Articles 120, 120b, and 120c).

Military law includes jurisdiction exercised by courts-martialand the jurisdiction exercised by commanders with respect to nonjudicialpunishment. The purpose of military law is to promote justice, to assist inmaintaining good order and discipline in the armed forces, to promote efficiencyand effectiveness in the military establishment, and thereby to strengthenthe national security of the United States.Structure and application of the Manual for Courts-MartialThe Manual for Courts-Martial shall consist of this Preamble, the Rules for Courts-Martial, the Military Rules of Evidence, the Punitive Articles, and Nonjudicial Punishment Procedures (Part I-V). This Manual shall be applied consistent with the purpose of military law.

The Department of Defense, in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security, publishes supplementary materials to accompany the Manual for Courts-Martial. These materials consist of a Preface, a Table of Contents, Discussions, Appendices, and an Index. These supplementary materials do not have the force of law and may be used as secondary authority.

The Manual shall be identified by the year in which it was printed; for example, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (20xx edition). Any amendments to the Manual made by Executive Order shall be identified as 20xx Amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 20xx being the year the Executive Order was signed.

The Department of Defense Joint Service Committee (JSC) on Military Justice reviews the Manual for Courts-Martial and proposes amendments to the Department of Defense (DoD) for consideration by the President on an annual basis. In conducting its annual review, the JSC is guided by DoD Directive 5500.17, Role and Responsibilities of the Joint Service Committee (JSC) on Military Justice. DoD Directive 5500.17 includes provisions allowing public participation in the annual review process.DiscussionThe Department of Defense, in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security, has published supplementary materials to accompany the Manual for Courts-Martial. These materials consist of a Discussion (accompanying the Preamble, the Rules for Courts-Martial, and the Punitive Articles), an Analysis, and various appendices. These supplementary materials do not constitute the official views of the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the military departments, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or any other authority of the Government of the United States, and they do not constitute rules. _Cf., e.g._, 5 U.S.C.  551(4). The supplementary materials do not create rights or responsibilities that are binding on any person, party, or other entity (including any authority of the Government of the United States whether or not included in the definition of agency in 5 U.S.C.  551(1)). Failure to comply with matter set forth in the supplementary materials does not, of itself, constitute error, although these materials may refer to requirements in the rules set forth in the Executive Order or established by other legal authorities (for example, binding judicial precedents applicable to courts-martial) that are based on sources of authority independent of the supplementary materials. See Appendix 21 in this Manual.

The 1995 amendment to paragraph 4 of the Preamble eliminated the practice of identifying the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, by a particular year. Historically the Manual had been published in its entirety sporadically (_e.g._, 1917, 1921, 1928, 1949, 1951, 1969, and 1984) with amendments to it published piecemeal. It was therefore logical to identify the Manual by the calendar year of publication, with periodic amendments identified as Changes to the Manual. Beginning in 1995, however, a new edition of the Manual was published in its entirety and a new naming convention was adopted. _See_ Exec. Order No. 12960 of May 12, 1995. Beginning in 1995, the Manual was to be referred to as Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (19xx edition). Amendments made to the Manual can be researched in the relevant Executive Order as referenced in Appendix 25. Although the Executive Orders were removed from Appendix 25 of the Manual in 2012 to reduce printing requirements, they can be accessed online. _See_ Appendix 25. The new changes to the Manual will also be annotated in the Preface.

Executive Order 13262 of April 11, 2002, mandated that, The Manual shall be identified as Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2002 edition). Therefore, the preambles in the 2005 and 2008 Manuals were improperly amended. In 2013, the preamble was amended to identify new Manuals based on their publication date.RULES FOR COURTSMARTIALGENERAL PROVISIONSScope, titleIn general.These rules govern the procedures and punishments in all courts-martialand, whenever expressly provided, preliminary, supplementary, and appellateprocedures and activities.

The Judge AdvocateGeneral concerned may temporarily suspend the subject of a complaint fromperforming judicial duties pending the outcome of any inquiry or investigationconducted pursuant to this rule. Such inquiries or investigations shall beconducted with reasonable promptness.DiscussionComplaints under this subsection will be treated with confidentiality.Confidentiality protects the subject judge and the judiciary when a complaintis not substantiated. Confidentiality also encourages the reporting of allegationsof judicial misconduct or unfitness and permits complaints to be screenedwith the full cooperation of others. 

Complaints containing allegationsof criminality should be referred to the appropriate criminal investigativeagency in accordance with Appendix 3 of this Manual.Initial inquiry.In general.An initial inquiry is necessary to determine if the complaint is substantiated. A complaint is substantiated upon finding that it is morelikely than not that the subject judge has engaged in judicial misconductor is otherwise unfit for further service as a judge.Responsibility to conduct initial inquiry.The Judge Advocate General concerned, or the person designated to receive complaints under subsection (c)(3) of this rule will conduct or order an initial inquiry. The individual designated to conduct the inquiry should,if practicable, be senior to the subject of the complaint. If the subjectof the complaint is a military trial judge, the individual designated toconduct the initial inquiry should, if practicable, be a military trial judgeor an individual with experience as a military trial judge. If the subjectof the complaint is an appellate military judge, the individual designatedto conduct the inquiry should, if practicable, have experience as an appellatemilitary judge.DiscussionTo avoid the type of conflict prohibited in Article 66(g), the Judge Advocate General's designee should not ordinarily be a member of the sameCourt of Criminal Appeals as the subject of the complaint. If practicable,a former appellate military judge should be designated.Due process.During the initial inquiry, the subject of the complaint will, ata minimum, be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.Action following the initial inquiry.If the complaint is not substantiated pursuant to subsection (c)(5)(A)of this rule, the complaint shall be dismissed as unfounded.

Normally, the commission will provide an opinionas to whether the subject's acts or omissions constitute judicial misconductor unfitness. If the commission determines that the affected judge engagedin judicial misconduct or is unfit for continued judicial service, the commissionmay be required to recommend an appropriate disposition to The Judge AdvocateGeneral concerned.DiscussionThe Judge Advocate General concerned may appoint an ad hoc or astanding commission.Rules of procedure.The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the service concerned may establish additional procedures consistent with this rule and Article 6a.JURISDICTIONJurisdiction in generalNature of courts-martial jurisdiction.The jurisdiction of courts-martial is entirely penal or disciplinary.DiscussionJurisdiction means the power to hear a case and to render a legally competent decision. A court-martial has no power to adjudge civil remedies. For example, a court-martial may not adjudge the paymentof damages, collect private debts, order the return of property, or ordera criminal forfeiture of seized property. A summary court-martial appointedunder 10 U.S.C.  4712 or 9712 to dispose of the effects of adeceased person is not affected by these Rules or this Manual.The code applies in all places.DiscussionExcept insofar as required by the Constitution, the Code, or the Manual, such as persons listed under Article 2(a)(10), jurisdiction of courts-martial does not depend on where the offense was committed.The jurisdiction of a court-martial with respect to offenses underthe code is not affected by the place where the court-martial sits. The jurisdictionof a court-martial with respect to military government or the law of waris not affected by the place where the court-martial sits except as otherwiseexpressly required by this Manual or applicable rule of international law.DiscussionIn addition to the power to try persons for offenses under the code, general courts-martial have power to try certain persons for violations ofthe law of war and for crimes or offenses against the law of the territoryoccupied as an incident of war or belligerency whenever the local civil authorityis superseded in whole or part by the military authority of the occupyingpower. _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(B). In cases where a personis tried by general court-martial for offenses against the law of an occupiedterritory, the court-martial normally sits in the country where the offenseis committed, and must do so under certain circumstances. _See_ Articles4, 64, and 66, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Personsin Time of War, August 12, 1949, arts. 4, 64, and 66, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 3559-60 T.I.A.S. No. 3365.Requisites of court-martial jurisdiction.A court-martial always has jurisdiction to determine whether ithas jurisdiction. Otherwise for a court-martial to have jurisdiction:The court-martial must be convened by an official empowered to conveneit;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 504; 1302.The court-martial must be composed in accordance with these rules with respect to number and qualifications of its personnel. As used here personnel includes only the military judge, the members, andthe summary court-martial;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 501-504; 1301.Each charge before the court-martial must be referred to it bycompetent authority;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 601.The accused must be a person subject to court-martial jurisdiction; andDiscussion_See_ R.C.M. 202.The offense must be subject to court-martial jurisdiction.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 203. 

The judgmentof a court-martial without jurisdiction is void and is entitled to no legaleffect. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)(iv). _But see_ R.C.M. 810(d) concerning the effect of certain decisions by courts-martial withoutjurisdiction.Contempt.A judge detailed to a court-martial may punish for contempt any person who uses any menacing word, sign, or gesture in the presence of the judge during the proceedings of the court-martial; disturbs the proceedings of the court-martial by any riot or disorder; or willfully disobeys the lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the court-martial. The punishment may not exceed confinement for 30 days or a fine of $1,000, or both.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 809 for procedures and standards forcontempt proceedings.Exclusive and nonexclusive jurisdiction.Courts-martial have exclusive jurisdiction of purely military offenses.An act or omission which violates both the code and local criminallaw, foreign or domestic, may be tried by a court-martial, or by a propercivilian tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, subject to R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)and regulations of the Secretary concerned, by both.Where an act or omission is subject to trial by court-martial andby one or more civil tribunals, foreign or domestic, the determination whichnation, state, or agency will exercise jurisdiction is a matter for the nations,states, and agencies concerned, and is not a right of the suspect or accused.DiscussionIn the case of an act or omission which violates the code and a criminal law of a State, the United States, or both, the determination whichagency shall exercise jurisdiction should normally be made through consultationor prior agreement between appropriate military officials (ordinarily thestaff judge advocate) and appropriate civilian authorities (United StatesAttorney, or equivalent). _See also_ Memorandum of UnderstandingBetween Departments of Justice and Defense Relating to the Investigationand Prosecution of Crimes Over Which the Two Departments Have ConcurrentJurisdiction at Appendix 3. 

Under the Constitution, a personmay not be tried for the same misconduct by both a court-martial and anotherfederal court. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Although it is constitutionallypermissible to try a person by court-martial and by a State court for thesame act, as a matter of policy a person who is pending trial or has beentried by a State court should not ordinarily be tried by court-martial forthe same act. Overseas, international agreements might preclude trial byone state of a person acquitted or finally convicted of a given act by theother state. 

Under international law, a friendly foreignnation has jurisdiction to punish offenses committed within its borders bymembers of a visiting force, unless expressly or impliedly consents to relinquishits jurisdiction to the visiting sovereign. The procedures and standardsfor determining which nation will exercise jurisdiction are normally establishedby treaty. _See_, for example, NATO Status of Forces Agreement,June 19, 1951, 4 U.S.T. 1792, T.I.A.S. No. 2846. As a matter of policy, effortsshould be made to maximize the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction overpersons subject to the code to the extent possible under applicable agreements.

See_ also R.C.M. 201(g) concerning the jurisdiction of other militarytribunals.Reciprocal jurisdiction.Each armed force has court-martial jurisdiction over all personssubject to the code.A commander of a unified or specified combatant command may convene courts-martial over members of any of the armed forces.So much of the authority vested in the President under Article22(a)(9) to empower any commanding officer of a joint command or joint task force to convene courts-martial is delegated to the Secretary of Defense,and such a commanding officer may convene general courts-martial for thetrial of members of any of the armed forces assigned or attached to a combatant command or joint command.A commander who is empowered to convene a court-martial under subsections(e)(2)(A) or (e)(2)(B) of this rule may expressly authorize a commandingofficer of a subordinate joint command or subordinate joint task force whois authorized to convene special and summary courts-martial to convene suchcourts-martial for the trial of members of other armed forces assigned or attached to a joint command or joint task force, under regulationswhich the superior command may prescribe. A member of one armed force may be tried by a court-martial convened by a member of another armed force, using the implementing regulations and procedures prescribed by the Secretary concerned of the military service of the accused, when:The court-martial is convened by a commander authorized to convene courts-martial under subsection (e)(2) of this rule; orThe accused cannot be delivered to the armed force of which the accused is a member without manifest injury to the armed forces. 

Anaccused should not ordinarily be tried by a court-martial convened by a memberof a different armed force except when the circumstances described in (A)or (B) exist. However, failure to comply with this policy does not affectan otherwise valid referral.Nothing in this rule prohibits detailing to a court-martial a militaryjudge, member, or counsel who is a member of an armed force different from that of the accusedor the convening authority, or both.In all cases, departmental review after that by the officer withauthority to convene a general court-martial for the command which held thetrial, where that review is required by the code, shall be carried out bythe department that includes the armed force of which the accused is a member.When there is a disagreement between the Secretaries of two military departments or between the Secretary of a military department and the commander of a unified or specified combatant command or other joint command or joint task force as to which organization should exercise jurisdiction over a particularcase or class of cases, the Secretary of Defense or an official acting underthe authority of the Secretary of Defense shall designate which organizationwill exercise jurisdiction.Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) or as otherwise directedby the President or Secretary of Defense, whenever action under this Manualis required or authorized to be taken by a person superior toa commander of a unified or specified combatant command or;a commander of any other joint command or joint task force thatis not part of a unified or specified combatant command, the mattershall be referred to the Secretary of the armed force of which the accusedis a member. The Secretary may convene a court-martial, take other appropriateaction, or, subject to R.C.M. 504(c), refer the matter to any person authorizedto convene a court-martial of the accused.DiscussionAs to the authority to convene courts-martial, see R.C.M. 504.Manifest injury does not mean minor inconvenienceor expense. Examples of manifest injury include direct and substantial effecton morale, discipline, or military operations, substantial expense or delay,or loss of essential witnesses. 

As to the composition ofa court-martial for the trial of an accused who is a member of another armedforce, _see_ R.C.M. 503(a)(3) Discussion. Cases involvingtwo or more accused who are members of different armed forces should notbe referred to a court-martial for a common trial.Types of courts-martial.__Note: R.C.M. 201(f)(1) and (f)(2) apply to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.__General courts-martial.Cases under the code.Except as otherwise expressly provided, general courts-martial maytry any person subject to the code for any offense made punishable underthe code. General courts-martial also may try any person for a violationof Article 83, 104, or 106. Upon a finding of guilty of an offense made punishable by the code, general courts-martial may, within limits prescribed by this Manual, adjudge any punishment authorized under R.C.M. 1003. Notwithstanding any other rule, the death penalty may not be adjudgedif:Not specifically authorized for the offense by the code and PartIV of this Manual; orThe case has not been referred with a special instruction that thecase is to be tried as capital.Cases under the law of war.General courts-martial may try any person who by the law of waris subject to trial by military tribunal for any crime or offense against:The law of war; orThe law of the territory occupied as an incident of war or belligerencywhenever the local civil authority is superseded in whole or part by themilitary authority of the occupying power. The law of the occupied territory includes the local criminal law as adopted or modified by competent authority,and the proclamations, ordinances, regulations, or orders promulgated bycompetent authority of the occupying power.DiscussionSubsection (f)(1)(B)(i)(b) is an exercise of thepower of military government.When a general court-martial exercises jurisdiction under the lawof war, it may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war.DiscussionCertain limitations on the discretion of military tribunals to adjudgepunishment under the law of war are prescribed in international conventions. _
See_, for example, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection ofCivilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 68, 6 U.S.T. 3516, T.I.A.S.No. 3365.Limitations in judge alone cases.A general court-martial composed only of a military judge does nothave jurisdiction to try any person for any offense for which the death penaltymay be adjudged unless the case has been referred to trial as noncapital.Jurisdiction for Certain Sexual Offenses. Only a general court-martial has jurisdiction to try offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), and 120b(b), UCMJ, forcible sodomy under Article 125, UCMJ, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ.Special courts-martial.In general.Except as otherwise expressly provided, special courts-martial maytry any person subject to the code for any noncapital offense made punishableby the code and, as provided in this rule, for capital offenses. Punishments.Upon a finding of guilty, special courts-martial may adjudge, underlimitations prescribed by this Manual, any punishment authorized under R.C.M.1003 except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal, confinement for morethan 1 year, hard labor without confinement for more than 3 months, forfeitureof pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture of pay for morethan 1 year. A bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, orforfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged by a specialcourt-martial unless:Counsel qualified under Article 27(b) is detailed to represent the accused; andA military judge is detailed to the trial, except in a case in whicha military judge could not be detailed because of physical conditions ormilitary exigencies. Physical conditions or military exigencies, as the termsare here used, may exist under rare circumstances, such as on an isolatedship on the high seas or in a unit in an inaccessible area, provided compellingreasons exist why trial must be held at that time and at that place. Mere inconvenience does not constitute a physical condition or military exigencyand does not excuse a failure to detail a military judge. If a military judgecannot be detailed because of physical conditions or military exigencies,a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeitureof pay for more than six months, may be adjudged provided the other conditionshave been met. In that event, however, the convening authority shall, priorto trial, make a written statement explaining why a military judge couldnot be obtained. This statement shall be appended to the record of trialand shall set forth in detail the reasons why a military judge could not bedetailed, and why the trial had to be held at that time and place.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 503 concerning detailing the militaryjudge and counsel. 

The requirement for counsel is satisfiedwhen counsel qualified under Article 27(b), and not otherwise disqualified,has been detailed and made available, even though the accused may not chooseto cooperate with, or use the services of, such detailed counsel. 

Thephysical condition or military exigency exception to the requirement fora military judge does not apply to the requirement for detailing counsel qualifiedunder Article 27(b). 

_See also_ R.C.M. 1103(c)concerning the requirements for a record of trial in special courts-martial.Capital offensesA capital offense for which there is prescribed a mandatory punishmentbeyond the punitive power of a special court-martial shall not be referredto such a court-martial. An officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over thecommand which includes the accused may permit any capital offense other thanone described in subsection (f)(2)(C)(i) of this rule to be referred to aspecial court-martial for trial. The Secretary concerned may authorize, by regulation, officers exercisingspecial court-martial jurisdiction to refer capital offenses, other thanthose described in subsection (f)(2)(C)(i) of this rule, to trial by specialcourt-martial without first obtaining the consent of the officer exercisinggeneral court-martial jurisdiction over the command.Certain Offenses under Articles 120, 120b, and 125.Notwithstanding subsection (f)(2)(A), special courts-martial do not have jurisdiction over offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), and 120b(b), forcible sodomy under Article 125, UCMJ, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ. Such offenses shall not be referred to a special court-martial.DiscussionPursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, only a general court-martial has jurisdiction over penetrative sex offenses under subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120, subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120b, Article 125, and attempts to commit such penetrative sex offenses under Article 80, UCMJ.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 103(3) for a definition of capital offenses.Summary courts-martial._See_ R.C.M. 1301(c) and (d)(1). Concurrent jurisdiction of other military tribunals.The provisions of the code and this Manual conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial do not deprive military commissions, provost courts,or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offendersor offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by militarycommissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.Discussion_See_ Articles 104 and 106 for some instances ofconcurrent jurisdiction.Persons subject to the jurisdiction of courts-martialIn general.Courts-martial may try any person when authorized to do so underthe code.DiscussionAuthority under the code.Article 2 lists classes of persons who are subject to the code.These include active duty personnel (Article 2(a)(1)); cadets, aviation cadets,and midshipmen (Article 2(a)(2)); certain retired personnel (Article 2(a)(4)and (5)); members of Reserve components not on active duty under some circumstances(Article 2(a)(3) and (6)); persons in the custody of the armed forces servinga sentence imposed by court-martial (Article 2(a)(7)); and, under some circumstances,specified categories of civilians (Article 2(a)(8), (9), (10), (11), and(12); _see_ subsection (3) and (4) of this discussion). In addition, certain persons whose status as members of the armed forces oras persons otherwise subject to the code apparently has ended may, nevertheless,be amendable to trial by court-martial. _See_ Article 3, 4,and 73. A person need not be subject to the code to be subject to trial bycourt-martial under Articles 83, 104, or 106. _See also_ Article48 and R.C.M. 809 concerning who may be subject to the contempt powers ofa court-martial. Active duty personnel.Court-martial jurisdiction is most commonly exercised over active duty personnel. In general, a person becomes subject to court-martial jurisdictionupon enlistment in or induction into the armed forces, acceptance of a commission,or entry onto active duty pursuant to orders. Court-martial jurisdictionover active duty personnel ordinarily ends on delivery of a discharge certificate or its equivalent to the person concerned issued pursuant to competent orders.Orders transferring a person to the inactive reserve are the equivalent ofa discharge certificate for purposes of jurisdiction. 

Theseare several important qualifications and exceptions to these general guidelines.Inception of court-martial jurisdiction over active duty personnel.Enlistment.The voluntary enlistment of any person who has the capacityto understand the significance of enlisting in the armed forces shall bevalid for purposes of jurisdiction under Article 2(a)and a change of status from civilian to member of the armed forces shall be effective upon taking the oath of enlistment. Article 2(b). A personwho is, at the time of enlistment, insane, intoxicated, or under the ageof 17 does not have the capacity to enlist by law. No court-martial jurisdictionover such a person may exist as long as the incapacity continues. If the incapacityceases to exist, a constructive enlistment may result underArticle 2(c). _See_ discussion of constructive enlistmentbelow. Similarly, if the enlistment was involuntary, court-martial jurisdictionwill exist only when the coercion is removed and a constructive enlistmentunder Article 2(c) is established. 

Persons age 17 (but notyet 18) may not enlist without parental consent. A parent or guardian may,within 90 days of its inception, terminate the enlistment of a 17-year-oldwho enlisted without parental consent, if the person has not yet reachedthe age of 18. 10 U.S.C.  1170. _See also_ DOD Directive1332.14 and service regulations for specific rules on separation of persons17 years of age on the basis of a parental request. Absent effective actionby a parent or guardian to terminate such an enlistment, court-martial jurisdictionexists over the person. An application by a parent for release does not deprivea court-martial of jurisdiction to try a person for offenses committed beforeaction is completed on such an application. 

Even if a personlacked capacity to understand the effect of enlistment or did not enlist voluntarily,a constructive enlistment may be established under Article2(c), which provides: 

Notwithstanding any otherprovision of law, a person serving with an armed force who submitted voluntary to military authority;met the mental competency and minimum age qualificationsof sections 504 and 505 of this title at the time of voluntary submissionto military authority that is, not insane, intoxicated, or underthe age of 17received military pay or allowances; andperformed military duties; 

is subject to the code until such person'sactive service has been terminated in accordance with law or regulationspromulgated by the Secretary concerned. 

Even if a personnever underwent an enlistment or induction proceeding of any kind, court-martialjurisdiction could be established under this provision.Induction.Court-martial jurisdiction does not extend to a draftee until: the draftee has completed an induction ceremony which was in substantial compliancewith the requirements prescribed by statute and regulations; the drafteeby conduct after an apparent induction, has waived objection to substantivedefects in it; or a constructive enlistment under Article 2(c)exists. 

The fact that a person was improperly inducted (forexample, because of incorrect classification or erroneous denial of exemption)does not of itself negate court-martial jurisdiction. When a person has madetimely and persistent efforts to correct such an error, court-martial jurisdictionmay be defeated if improper induction is found, depending on all the circumstancesof the case.Call to active duty.A member of a reserve component may be called or ordered to active duty for a variety of reasons, including training, service in time of waror national emergency, discipline, or as a result of failure to participatesatisfactorily in unit activities. 

When a person is orderedto active duty for failure to satisfactorily participate in unit activities,the order must substantially comply with procedures prescribed by regulations,to the extent due process requires, for court-martial jurisdiction to exist.Generally, the person must be given notice of the activation and the reasonstherefor, and an opportunity to object to the activation. A person waivesthe right to contest involuntary activation by failure to exercise this right within a reasonable time after notice of the right to do so.Termination of jurisdiction over active duty personnel.As indicated above, the delivery of a valid discharge certificateor its equivalent ordinarily serves to terminate court-martial jurisdiction.Effect of completion of term of service.Completion of an enlistment or term of service does not by itself terminate court-martial jurisdiction. An original term of enlistment maybe adjusted for a variety of reasons, such as making up time lost for unauthorizedabsence. Even after such adjustments are considered, court-martial jurisdictionnormally continues past the time of scheduled separation until a dischargecertificate or its equivalent is delivered or until the Government fails toact within a reasonable time after the person objects to continued retention. 

Asindicated in subsection (c) of this rule, servicemembers may be retainedpast their scheduled time of separation, over protest, by action with a viewto trial while they are still subject to the code. Thus, if action with aview to trial is initiated before discharge or the effective terminal dateof self-executing orders, a person may be retained beyond the date that the period of service would otherwise have expired or the terminal date of suchorders.Effect of discharge and reenlistment.For offenses occurring on or after 23 October 1992, under the 1992 Amendment to Article 3(a), a person who reenlists following a discharge maybe tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service. For offensesoccurring prior to 23 October 1992, a person who reenlists following a dischargemay be tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service onlyif the offense was punishable by confinement for five (5) years or more andcould not be tried in the courts of the United States or of a State, a Territory,or the District of Columbia. However, _see_ (iii)(a) below.Exceptions.There are several exceptions to the general principle that court-martialjurisdiction terminates on discharge or its equivalent.A person who was subject to the code at the time an offense was committed may be tried by court-martial for that offense despite a laterdischarge or other termination of that status if:For offenses occurring on or after 23 October 1992, the person is,at the time of the court-martial, subject to the code, by reentry into thearmed forces or otherwise. _See_ Article 3(a) as amended bythe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-484,106 Stat. 2315, 2505 (1992);For offenses occurring before 23 October 1992,The offense is one for which a court-martial may adjudge confinementfor five (5) or more years;The person cannot be tried in the courts of the United States orof a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia; andThe person is, at the time of the court-martial, subject to thecode, by reentry into the armed forces or otherwise. _See_ Article3(a) prior to the 1992 amendment.A person who was subject to the code at the time the offense wascommitted is subject to trial by court-martial despite a later dischargeifThe discharge was issued before the end of the accused's term ofenlistment for the purpose of reenlisting;The person remains, at the time of the court-martial, subject tothe code; andThe reenlistment occurred after 26 July 1982.Persons in the custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposedby a court-martial remain subject to the code and court-martial jurisdiction.A prisoner who has received a discharge and who remains in the custody ofan armed force may be tried for an offense committed while a member of thearmed forces and before the execution of the discharge as well as for offensescommitted after it.A person discharged from the armed forces who is later charged withhaving fraudulently obtained that discharge is, subject to the statute oflimitations, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge, and is afterapprehension subject to the code while in the custody of the armed forcesfor trial. Upon conviction of that charge such a person is subject to trialby court-martial for any offenses under the code committed before the fraudulentdischarge.No person who has deserted from the armed forces is relieved fromcourt-martial jurisdiction by a separation from any later period of service.When a person's discharge or other separation does not interruptthe status as a person belonging to the general category of persons subjectto the code, court-martial jurisdiction over that person does not end. Forexample, when an officer holding a commission in a Reserve component of anarmed force is discharged from that commission while on active duty becauseof acceptance of a commission in a Regular component of that armed force,without an interval between the periods of service under the two commissions,that officer's military status does not end. There is merely a change inpersonnel status from temporary to permanent officer, and court-martial jurisdictionover an offense committed before the discharge is not affected.Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Members of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration become subject to the code when assigned to andserving with the armed forces.Limitations on jurisdiction over civilians.Court-martial jurisdiction over civilians under the code is limited by the Constitution and other applicable laws, including as construed in judicial decisions. The exercise of jurisdiction under Article 2(a)(11) in peace time has been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.  Before initiating court-martial proceedings against a civilian, relevant statutes, decisions, service regulations, and policy memoranda should be carefully examined.Members of a Reserve Component.Members of a reserve component in federal service on active duty,as well as those in federal service on inactive-duty training, are subjectto the code. Moreover, members of a reserve component are amenable to thejurisdiction of courts-martial notwithstanding the termination of a periodof such duty. _See_ R.C.M. 204.Offenses under the law of war.Nothing in this rule limits the power of general courts-martialto try persons under the law of war. _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(B).Attachment of jurisdiction over the person.In general.Court-martial jurisdiction attaches over a person when action witha view to trial of that person is taken. Once court-martial jurisdictionover a person attaches, such jurisdiction shall continue for all purposesof trial, sentence, and punishment, notwithstanding the expiration of thatperson's term of service or other period in which that person was subjectto the code or trial by court-martial. When jurisdiction attaches over aservicemember on active duty, the servicemember may be held on active dutyover objection pending disposition of any offense for which held and shallremain subject to the code during the entire period.DiscussionCourt-martial jurisdiction exists to try a person as long as that person occupies a status as a person subject to the code. _See also
_ Article 104 and 106. Thus, a servicemember is subject to court-martialjurisdiction until lawfully discharged or, when the servicemember's term of service has expired, the government fails to act within a reasonable timeon objection by the servicemember to continued retention. 

Court-martialjurisdiction attaches over a person upon action with a view to trial. Oncecourt-martial jurisdiction attaches, it continues throughout the trial and appellate process, and for purposes of punishment. 

If jurisdictionhas attached before the effective terminal date of self-executing orders,the person may be held for trial by court-martial beyond the effective terminaldate.Procedure.Actions by which court-martial jurisdiction attaches include: apprehension;imposition of restraint, such as restriction, arrest, or confinement; andpreferral of charges. Jurisdiction over the offenseTo the extent permitted by the Constitution, courts-martial maytry any offense under the code and, in the case of general courts-martial,the law of war.DiscussionIn general.Courts-martial have power to try any offense under the code except when prohibited from so doing by the Constitution. The rule enunciated in_
Solorio v. United States_, 483 U.S. 435 (1987) is that jurisdictionof courts-martial depends solely on the accused's status as a person subjectto the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and not on the service-connectionof the offense charged.Pleading and proof.Normally, the inclusion of the accused's rank or grade will be sufficientto plead the service status of the accused. Ordinarily, no allegation ofthe accused's armed force or unit is necessary for military members on activeduty. _See_ R.C.M. 307 regarding required specificity of pleadings.Jurisdiction over certain reserve component personnelService regulations.The Secretary concerned shall prescribe regulations setting forth rules and procedures for the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction and nonjudicialpunishment authority over reserve component personnel under Article 2(a)(3)and 2(d), subject to the limitations of this Manual and the UCMJ.DiscussionSuch regulations should describe procedures for ordering a reservist to active duty for disciplinary action, for the preferral, investigation, forwarding, and referral of charges, designation of convening authoritiesand commanders authorized to conduct nonjudicial punishment proceedings,and for other appropriate purposes. 

_See_ definitionsin R.C.M. 103 (Discussion). _See_ paragraph 5e and f, PartV, concerning limitations on nonjudicial punishments imposed on reservistswhile on inactive-duty training. 

Members of the Army NationalGuard and the Air National Guard are subject to Federal court-martial jurisdictiononly when the offense concerned is committed while the member is in Federalservice.Courts-MartialGeneral and special court-martial proceedings.A member of a reserve component must be on active duty prior to arraignment at a general or special court-martial. A member ordered to activeduty pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty to serve anyadjudged confinement or other restriction on liberty if the order to activeduty was approved in accordance with Article 2(d)(5), but such member maynot be retained on active duty pursuant to Article 2(d) after service ofthe confinement or other restriction on liberty. All punishments remaining unserved at the time the member is released from active duty may be carriedover to subsequent periods of inactive-duty training or active duty.DiscussionAn accused ordered to active duty pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty after service of the punishment if permitted by otherauthority. For example, an accused who commits another offense while on activeduty ordered pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty pursuant to R.C.M. 202(c)(1).Summary courts-martial.A member of a reserve component may be tried by summary court-martialeither while on active duty or inactive-duty training. A summary court-martialconducted during inactive-duty training may be in session only during normalperiods of such training. The accused may not be held beyond such periodsof training for trial or service or any punishment. All punishments remainingunserved at the end of a period of active duty or the end of any normal periodof inactive duty training may be carried over to subsequent periods of inactive-dutytraining or active duty.DiscussionA normal period of inactive-duty training does not include periods which are scheduled solely for the purpose of conducting court-martial proceedings.Applicability.This subsection is not applicable when a member is held on activeduty pursuant to R.C.M. 202(c). Changes in type of service.A member of a reserve component at the time disciplinary actionis initiated, who is alleged to have committed an offense while on activeduty or inactive-duty training, is subject to court-martial jurisdictionwithout regard to any change between active and reserve service or within different categories of reserve service subsequent to commission of the offense.This subsection does not apply to a person whose military status was completelyterminated after commission of an offense.DiscussionA member of a regular or reserve component remains subject to court-martialjurisdiction after leaving active duty for offenses committed prior to suchtermination of active duty if the member retains military status in a reservecomponent without having been discharged from all obligations of militaryservice. 

_See_ R.C.M. 202(a), Discussion,paragraph (2)(B)(ii) and (iii) regarding the jurisdictional effect of a dischargefrom military service. A complete termination of military statusrefers to a discharge relieving the servicemember of any further militaryservice. It does not include a discharge conditioned upon acceptance of further military service.INITIATION OF CHARGES; APPREHENSION; PRETRIAL RESTRAINT; RELATED MATTERSReport of offenseWho may report.Any person may report an offense subject to trial by court-martial.To whom reports conveyed for disposition.Ordinarily, any military authority who receives a report of anoffense shall forward as soon as practicable the report and any accompanyinginformation to the immediate commander of the suspect. Competent authoritysuperior to that commander may direct otherwise.DiscussionAny military authority may receive a report of an offense. Typically such reports are made to law enforcement or investigative personnel, or toappropriate persons in the chain of command. A report may be made by anymeans, and no particular format is required. When a person who is not a lawenforcement official receives a report of an offense, that person shouldforward the report to the immediate commander of the suspect unless thatperson believes it would be more appropriate to notify law enforcement orinvestigative authorities. 

If the suspect is unidentified,the military authority who receives the report should refer it to a law enforcementor investigative agency. 

Upon receipt of a report, the immediatecommander of a suspect should refer to R.C.M. 306 (Initial disposition). _
See also_ R.C.M. 302 (Apprehension); R.C.M. 303 (Preliminary inquiry);R.C.M. 304, 305 (Pretrial restraint, confinement).ApprehensionDefinition and scope.Definition.Apprehension is the taking of a person into custody.DiscussionApprehension is the equivalent of arrest in civilianterminology. (In military terminology, arrest is a form ofrestraint. _ See_ Article 9; R.C.M. 304.) _See_ subsection(c) of this rule concerning the bases for apprehension. An apprehension isnot required in every case; the fact that an accused was never apprehendeddoes not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial to try the accused. However, _
 see_ R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction. 

Anapprehension is different from detention of a person for investigative purposes,although each involves the exercise of government control over the freedomof movement of a person. An apprehension must be based on probable cause,and the custody initiated in an apprehension may continue until proper authorityis notified and acts under R.C.M. 304 or 305. An investigative detention may be made on less than probable cause (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 314(f)),and normally involves a relatively short period of custody. Furthermore,an extensive search of the person is not authorized incident to an investigativedetention, as it is with an apprehension. _See_ Mil. R. Evid.314(f) and (g). This rule does not affect any seizure of the person lesssevere than apprehension. 

Evidence obtained as the resultof an apprehension which is in violation of this rule may be challenged underMil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1). Evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful civilianarrest may be challenged under Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1), (2).Scope.This rule applies only to apprehensions made by persons authorizedto do so under subsection (b) of this rule with respect to offenses subjectto trial by court-martial. Nothing in this rule limits the authority of federallaw enforcement officials to apprehend persons, whether or not subject totrial by court-martial, to the extent permitted by applicable enabling statutesand other law.DiscussionR.C.M. 302 does not affect the authority of any official to detain, arrest, or apprehend persons not subject to trial under the code. The ruledoes not apply to actions taken by any person in a private capacity. 

Severalfederal agencies have broad powers to apprehend persons for violations offederal laws, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For example,agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Marshals, andagents of the Secret Service may apprehend persons for any offenses committedin their presence and for felonies. 18 U.S.C.  3052, 3053, 3056. Other agencies have apprehension powers include the General Services Administration,40 U.S.C.  318 and the Veterans Administration, 38 U.S.C.  218.The extent to which such agencies become involved in the apprehension ofpersons subject to trial by courts-martial may depend on the statutory authorityof the agency and the agency's formal or informal relationships with theDepartment of Defense.Who may apprehend.The following officials may apprehend any person subject to trialby court-martial: Military law enforcement officials.Security police, military police, master at arms personnel, members of the shore patrol, and persons designated by proper authorities to performmilitary criminal investigative, guard, or police duties, whether subjectto the code or not, when in each of the foregoing instances, the officialmaking the apprehension is in the execution of law enforcement duties;DiscussionWhenever enlisted persons, including police and guards, and civilianpolice and guards apprehend any commissioned or warrant officer, such personsshould make an immediate report to the commissioned officer to whom the apprehendingperson is responsible. 

The phrase persons designatedby proper authority to perform military criminal investigative, guard orpolice duties includes special agents of the Defense Criminal InvestigativeService.Commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers.All commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers onactive duty or inactive duty training; DiscussionNoncommissioned and petty officers not otherwise performing law enforcement duties should not apprehend a commissioned officer unless directedto do so by a commissioned officer or in order to prevent disgrace to theservice or the escape of one who has committed a serious offense.Civilians authorized to apprehend deserters.Under Article 8, any civilian officer having authority to apprehend offenders under laws of the United States or of a State, Territory, Commonwealth,or possession, or the District of Columbia, when the apprehension is of adeserter from the armed forces.DiscussionThe code specifically provides that any civil officer, whether ofa State, Territory, district, or of the United States may apprehend any deserter. However,this authority does not permit state and local law enforcement officers toapprehend persons for other violations of the code. _ See_ Article8.Grounds for apprehension.A person subject to the code or trial thereunder may be apprehended for an offense triable by court-martial upon probable cause to apprehend. Probable cause to apprehend exists when there are reasonable grounds to believethat an offense has been or is being committed and the person to be apprehendedcommitted or is committing it. Persons authorized to apprehend under subsection(b)(2) of this rule may also apprehend persons subject to the code who takepart in quarrels, frays, or disorders, wherever they occur.DiscussionReasonable grounds means that there must be the kindof reliable information that a reasonable, prudent person would rely on whichmakes it more likely than not that something is true. A mere suspicion isnot enough but proof which would support a conviction is not necessary. Aperson who determines probable cause may rely on the reports of others.How an apprehension may be made.In general.An apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person to be apprehendedthat person is in custody. This notice should be given orally or in writing,but it may be implied by the circumstances.Warrants.Neither warrants nor any other authorization shall be required foran apprehension under these rules except as required in subsection (e)(2)of this rule. Use of force.Any person authorized under these rules to make an apprehensionmay use such force and means as reasonably necessary under the circumstancesto effect the apprehension.DiscussionIn addition to any other action required by law or regulation or proper military officials, any person making an apprehension under theserules should maintain custody of the person apprehended and inform as promptlyas possible the immediate commander of the person apprehended, or any officialhigher in the chain of command of the person apprehended if it is impractical to inform the immediate commander.Where an apprehension may be made.In general.An apprehension may be made at any place, except as provided insubsection (e)(2) of this rule. Private dwellings.A private dwelling includes dwellings, on or off a military installation,such as single family houses, duplexes, and apartments. The quarters may beowned, leased, or rented by the residents, or assigned, and may be occupiedon a temporary or permanent basis. Private dwelling does notinclude the following, whether or not subdivided into individual units: livingareas in military barracks, vessels, aircraft, vehicles, tents, bunkers,field encampments, and similar places. No person may enter a private dwellingfor the purpose of making an apprehension under these rules unless: Pursuant to consent under Mil. R. Evid. 314(e) or 316(d)(2); Under exigent circumstances described in Mil. R. Evid. 315(g) or316(d)(4)(B); In the case of a private dwelling which is military property orunder military control, or nonmilitary property in a foreign countryif the person to be apprehended is a resident of the private dwelling,there exists, at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the personto be apprehended is present in the dwelling, and the apprehension has beenauthorized by an official listed in Mil. R. Evid. 315(d) upon a determinationthat probable cause to apprehend the person exists; or if the person to be apprehended is not a resident of the private dwelling, the entry has been authorized by an official listed in Mil. R.Evid. 315(d) upon a determination that probable cause exists to apprehendthe person and to believe that the person to be apprehended is or will be present at the time of the entry; In the case of a private dwelling not included in subsection (e)(2)(C)of this rule, if the person to be apprehended is a resident of the private dwelling,there exists at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the person tobe apprehended is present and the apprehension is authorized by an arrestwarrant issued by competent civilian authority; or if the person to be apprehended is not a resident of the private dwelling, the apprehension is authorized by an arrest warrant and the entryis authorized by a search warrant, each issued by competent civilian authority. Aperson who is not a resident of the private dwelling entered may not challengethe legality of an apprehension of that person on the basis of failure tosecure a warrant or authorization to enter that dwelling, or on the basisof the sufficiency of such a warrant or authorization. Nothing in this subsection((e)(2)) affects the legality of an apprehension which is incident to otherwiselawful presence in a private dwelling.DiscussionFor example, if law enforcement officials enter a private dwellingpursuant to a valid search warrant or search authorization, they may apprehendpersons therein if grounds for an apprehension exist. This subsection is not intended to be an independent grant of authority to execute civilian arrestor search warrants. The authority must derive from an appropriate Federalor state procedure. _See e.g._ Fed. R. Crim. P. 41 and 28 C.F.R.60.1. Preliminary inquiry into reported offensesUpon receipt of information that a member of the command is accusedor suspected of committing an offense or offenses triable by court-martial,the immediate commander shall make or cause to be made a preliminary inquiryinto the charges or suspected offenses.DiscussionThe preliminary inquiry is usually informal. It may be an examinationof the charges and an investigative report or other summary of expected evidence.In other cases a more extensive investigation may be necessary. Althoughthe commander may conduct the investigation personally or with members ofthe command, in serious or complex cases the commander should consider whetherto seek the assistance of law enforcement personnel in conducting any inquiryor further investigation. The inquiry should gather all reasonably availableevidence bearing on guilt or innocence and any evidence relating to aggravation,extenuation, or mitigation. 

The Military Rules of Evidenceshould be consulted when conducting interrogations (_see_Mil. R. Evid. 301-306), searches (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 311-317),and eyewitness identifications (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 321). 

Ifthe offense is one for which the Department of Justice has investigative responsibilities, appropriate coordination should be made under the Memorandum of Understanding,_
see_ Appendix 3, and any implementing regulations. 

Ifit appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings inthe case, this should be brought to the attention of appropriate authorities. _
See also_ R.C.M. 702 (depositions). 

A person whois an accuser (_see_ Article 1(9)) is disqualified from convening a general or special court-martial in that case. R.C.M. 504(c)(1). Therefore,when the immediate commander is a general or special court-martial conveningauthority, the preliminary inquiry should be conducted by another officerof the command. That officer may be informed that charges may be preferredif the officer determines that preferral is warranted.Pretrial restraintTypes of pretrial restraint.Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a person'sliberty which is imposed before and during disposition of offenses. Pretrialrestraint may consist of conditions on liberty, restriction in lieu of arrest, arrest, or confinement.Conditions on liberty.Conditions on liberty are imposed by orders directing a person todo or refrain from doing specified acts. Such conditions may be imposed inconjunction with other forms of restraint or separately.Restriction in lieu of arrest.Restriction in lieu of arrest is the restraint of a person by oralor written orders directing the person to remain within specified limits;a restricted person shall, unless otherwise directed, perform full militaryduties while restricted.Arrest.Arrest is the restraint of a person by oral or written order notimposed as punishment, directing the person to remain within specified limits;a person in the status of arrest may not be required to perform full militaryduties such as commanding or supervising personnel, serving as guard, or bearingarms. The status of arrest automatically ends when the person is placed,by the authority who ordered the arrest or a superior authority, on dutyinconsistent with the status of arrest, but this shall not prevent requiringthe person arrested to do ordinary cleaning or policing, or to take partin routine training and duties.Confinement.Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order ofcompetent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition ofoffenses. _See_ R.C.M. 305.DiscussionConditions on liberty include orders to report periodically to aspecified official, orders not to go to a certain place (such as the sceneof the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with specified persons(such as the alleged victim or potential witnesses). Conditions on libertymust not hinder pretrial preparation, however. Thus, when such conditionsare imposed, they must by sufficiently flexible to permit pretrial preparation. 

Restrictionin lieu of arrest is a less severe restraint on liberty than is arrest. Arrest includes suspension from performing full military duties and the limits ofarrest are normally narrower than those of restriction in lieu of arrest.The actual nature of the restraint imposed, and not the characterizationof it by the officer imposing it, will determine whether it is technicallyan arrest or restriction in lieu of arrest. 

Breach of arrestor restriction in lieu of arrest or violation of conditions on liberty areoffenses under the code. _See_ paragraphs 16, 19, and 102, Part IV. When such an offense occurs, it may warrant appropriate action suchas nonjudicial punishment or court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 306.In addition, such a breach or violation may provide a basis for the impositionof a more severe form of restraint. 

R.C.M. 707(a) requiresthat the accused be brought to trial within 120 days of preferral of chargesor imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4).Who may order pretrial restraint.Of civilians and officers.Only a commanding officer to whose authority the civilian or officeris subject may order pretrial restraint of that civilian or officer.DiscussionCivilians may be restrained under these rules only when they aresubject to trial by court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 202.Of enlisted persons.Any commissioned officer may order pretrial restraint of any enlistedperson.Delegation of authority.The authority to order pretrial restraint of civilians and commissionedand warrant officers may not be delegated. A commanding officer may delegateto warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers authority to order pretrialrestraint of enlisted persons of the commanding officer's command or subjectto the authority of that commanding officer.Authority to withhold.A superior competent authority may withhold from a subordinate the authority to order pretrial restraint.When a person may be restrained.No person may be ordered into restraint before trial except forprobable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial restraint exists when thereis a reasonable belief that:An offense triable by court-martial has been committed;The person to be restrained committed it; andThe restraint ordered is required by the circumstances.DiscussionThe decision whether to impose pretrial restraint, and, if so, whattype or types, should be made on a case-by-case basis. The factors listedin the Discussion of R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B) should be considered. The restraintshould not be more rigorous than the circumstances require to ensure thepresence of the person restrained or to prevent foreseeable serious criminalmisconduct. 

Restraint is not required in every case. Theabsence of pretrial restraint does not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial.However, _see_ R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction. _
See_ R.C.M. 305 concerning the standards and procedures governingpretrial confinement.Procedures for ordering pretrial restraint.Pretrial restraint other than confinement is imposed by notifyingthe person orally or in writing of the restraint, including its terms orlimits. The order to an enlisted person shall be delivered personally bythe authority who issues it or through other persons subject to the code.The order to an officer or a civilian shall be delivered personally by theauthority who issues it or by another commissioned officer. Pretrial confinementis imposed pursuant to orders by a competent authority by the delivery ofa person to a place of confinement.Notice of basis for restraint.When a person is placed under restraint, the person shall be informedof the nature of the offense which is the basis for such restraint.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 305(e) concerning additional informationwhich must be given to a person who is confined. If the person ordering therestrain is not the commander of the person restrained, that officer shouldbe notified.Punishment prohibited.Pretrial restraint is not punishment and shall not be used as such. No person who is restrained pending trial may be subjected to punishmentor penalty for the offense which is the basis for that restraint. Prisonersbeing held for trial shall not be required to undergo punitive duty hoursor training, perform punitive labor, or wear special uniforms prescribedonly for post-trial prisoners. This rule does not prohibit minor punishmentduring pretrial confinement for infractions of the rules of the place of confinement.Prisoners shall be afforded facilities and treatment under regulations ofthe Secretary concerned.DiscussionOffenses under the code by a person under restraint may be disposed of in the same manner as any other offenses.Release.Except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 305, a person may be released from pretrial restraint by a person authorized to impose it. Pretrial restraintshall terminate when a sentence is adjudged, the accused is acquitted ofall charges, or all charges are dismissed.DiscussionPretrial restraint may be imposed (or reimposed) if charges areto be reinstated or a rehearing or other trial is to beordered.Administrative restraint.Nothing in this rule prohibits limitations on a servicemember imposed for operational or other military purposes independent of military justice,including administrative hold or medical reasons.Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 306.Pretrial confinementIn general.Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order of competent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of charges.DiscussionNo member of the armed forces may be placed in confinement in immediateassociation with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not members ofthe armed forces of the United States. Article 12. However, if members ofthe armed forces of the United States are separated from prisoners of theother categories mentioned, they may be confined in the same confinementfacilities.Who may be confined.Any person who is subject to trial by court-martial may be confined if the requirements of this rule are met.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 201 and 202 and the discussions thereinconcerning persons who are subject to trial by courts-martial.Who may order confinement._See_ R.C.M. 304(b).DiscussionNo provost marshal, commander of a guard, or master at arms may refuse to receive or keep any prisoner committed to his charge by acommissioned officer of the armed forces, when the committing officer furnishes a statement, signed by him, of the offense charged against the prisoner. Article 11(a).When a person may be confined.No person may be ordered into pretrial confinement except for probablecause. Probable cause to order pretrial confinement exists when there isa reasonable belief that:An offense triable by court-martial has been committed;The person confined committed it; andConfinement is required by the circumstances.DiscussionThe person who directs confinement should consider the mattersdiscussed under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule before ordering confinement. However, the person who initially orders confinement is not required to makea detailed analysis of the necessity for confinement. It is often not possibleto review a person's background and character or even the details of an offense before physically detaining the person. For example, until additional informationcan be secured, it may be necessary to confine a person apprehended in thecourse of a violent crime. 

Whencharged only with an offense normally tried by summary court-martial, anaccused shall not ordinarily be paced in confinement. Article10. 

Confinement should be distinguished from custody. Custody is restraint which is imposed by apprehension and which may be, but is not necessarily, physical. Custody may be imposed by anyone authorized to apprehend(_see_ R.C.M. 302(b)), and may continue until a proper authorityunder R.C.M. 304(B) is notified and takes action. Thus, a person who hasbeen apprehended could be physically restrained, but this would not be pretrialconfinement in the sense of this rule until a person authorized to do sounder R.C.M. 304(b) directed confinement.Advice to the accused upon confinement.Each person confined shall be promptly informed of:The nature of the offenses for which held;The right to remain silent and that any statement made by the personmay be used against the person; The right to retain civilian counsel at no expense to the UnitedStates, and the right to request assignment of military counsel; andThe procedures by which pretrial confinement will be reviewed.Military counsel.If requested by the prisoner and such request is made known tomilitary authorities, military counsel shall be provided to the prisoner beforethe initial review under subsection (i) of this rule or within 72 hours ofsuch a request being first communicated to military authorities, whicheveroccurs first. Counsel may be assigned for the limited purpose of representingthe accused only during the pretrial confinement proceedings before chargesare referred. If assignment is made for this limited purpose, the prisonershall be so informed. Unless otherwise provided by regulations of the Secretaryconcerned, a prisoner does not have a right under this rule to have militarycounsel of the prisoner's own selection.Who may direct release from confinement.Any commander of a prisoner, an officer appointed under regulations of the Secretary concerned to conduct the review under subsection (i) and/or (j) of this rule, or, once charges have been referred, a military judgedetailed to the court-martial to which the charges against the accused havebeen referred, may direct release from pretrial confinement. For purposesof this subsection, any commander includes the immediate orhigher commander of the prisoner and the commander of the installation onwhich the confinement facility is located.Notification and action by commander.Report.Unless the commander of the prisoner ordered the pretrial confinement,the commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer into whose chargethe prisoner was committed shall, within 24 hours after that commitment,cause a report to be made to the commander that shall contain the name ofthe prisoner, the offenses charged against the prisoner, and the name ofthe person who ordered or authorized confinement.DiscussionThis report may be made by any means. Ordinarily, the immediate commander of the prisoner should be notified. In unusual cases any commanderto whose authority the prisoner is subject, such as the commander of the confinement facility, may be notified. In the latter case, the commanderso notified must ensure compliance with subsection (h)(2) of this rule.Action by commander.Decision.Not later than 72 hours after the commander's ordering of a prisoner into pretrial confinement or, after receipt of a report that a member ofthe commander's unit or organization has been confined, whichever situationis applicable, the commander shall decide whether pretrial confinement willcontinue. A commander's compliance with this subsection may also satisfythe 48-hour probable cause determination of subsection R.C.M. 305(i)(1) below,provided the commander is a neutral and detached officer and acts within48 hours of the imposition of confinement under military control. Nothingin subsections R.C.M. 305(d), R.C.M. 305(i)(1), or this subsection preventsa neutral and detached commander from completing the 48-hour probable causedetermination and the 72-hour commander's decision immediately after an accusedis ordered into pretrial confinement.Requirements for confinement.The commander shall direct the prisoner's release from pretrial confinement unless the commander believes upon probable cause, that is, upon reasonable grounds, that:An offense triable by a court-martial has been committed;The prisoner committed it; andConfinement is necessary because it is foreseeable that:The prisoner will not appear at trial, pretrial hearing, or investigation,orThe prisoner will engage in serious criminal misconduct; andLess severe forms of restraint are inadequate. 

Seriouscriminal misconduct includes intimidation of witnesses or other obstructionof justice, serious injury of others, or other offenses which pose a seriousthreat to the safety of the community or to the effectiveness, morale, discipline,readiness, or safety of the command, or to the national security of the UnitedStates. As used in this rule, national security means the nationaldefense and foreign relations of the United States and specifically includes:a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations;a favorable foreign relations position; or a defense posture capable of successfullyresisting hostile or destructive action from within or without, overt orcovert.DiscussionA person should not be confined as a mere matter of convenienceor expedience. 

Some of the factors which should be consideredunder this subsection are: The nature and circumstances of the offenses charged or suspected, including extenuating circumstances;The weight of the evidence against the accused;The accused's ties to the locale, including family, off-duty employment, financial resources, and length of residence;The accused's character and mental condition;The accused's service record, including any record of previousmisconduct;The accused's record of appearance at or flight from other pretrial investigations, trials, and similar proceedings; andThe likelihood that the accused can and will commit further serious criminal misconduct if allowed to remain at liberty. 

Although the Military Rules of Evidence are notapplicable, the commander should judge the reliability of the informationavailable. Before relying on the reports of others, the commander must havea reasonable belief that the information is believable and has a factual basis. The information may be received orally or in writing. Information need notbe received under oath, but an oath may add to its reliability. A commandermay examine the prisoner's personnel records, police records, and may considerthe recommendations of others. 

Less serious forms of restraintmust always be considered before pretrial confinement may be approved. Thusthe commander should consider whether the prisoner could be safely returnedto the prisoner's unit, at liberty or under restriction, arrest, or conditionson liberty. _See_ R.C.M. 304.72-hour memorandum.If continued pretrial confinement is approved, the commander shall prepare a written memorandum that states the reasons for the conclusion thatthe requirements for confinement in subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule havebeen met. This memorandum may include hearsay and may incorporate by referenceother documents, such as witness statements, investigative reports, or officialrecords. This memorandum shall be forwarded to the 7-day reviewing officerunder subsection (i)(2) of this rule. If such a memorandum was prepared bythe commander before ordering confinement, a second memorandum need not be prepared; however, additional information may be added to the memorandumat any time.Procedures for review of pretrial confinement.48-hour probable cause determination.Review of the adequacy of probable cause to continue pretrial confinementshall be made by a neutral and detached officer within 48 hours of impositionof confinement under military control. If the prisoner is apprehended bycivilian authorities and remains in civilian custody at the request of militaryauthorities, reasonable efforts will be made to bring the prisoner undermilitary control in a timely fashion.7-day review of pretrial confinement.Within 7 days of the imposition of confinement, a neutral and detachedofficer appointed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretaryconcerned shall review the probable cause determination and necessity forcontinued pretrial confinement. In calculating the number of days of confinementfor purposes of this rule, the initial date of confinement under militarycontrol shall count as one day and the date of the review shall also countas one day.Nature of the 7-day review.Matters considered.The review under this subsection shall include a review of the memorandum submitted by the prisoners commander under subsection (h)(2)(C) of this rule. Additional written matters may be considered, including any submitted by the prisoner. The prisoner and the prisoners counsel, if any, shall be allowed to appear before the 7-day reviewing officer and make a statement, if practicable. A representative of the command may also appear before the reviewing officer to make a statement.Rules of evidence.Except for Mil. R. Evid., Section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid.302 and 305, the Military Rules of Evidence shall not apply to the mattersconsidered.Standard of proof.The requirements for confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.Victims right to be reasonably heard.A victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the 7-day review; the right to confer with the representative of the command and counsel for the government, if any, and the right to be reasonably heard during the review. However, the hearing may not be unduly delayed for this purpose. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel. The victim of an alleged offense shall be notified of these rights in accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.DiscussionPersonal appearance by the victim is not required. A victims right to be reasonably heard at a 7-day review may also be accomplished telephonically, by video teleconference, or by written statement.Extension of time limit.The 7-day reviewing officer may, for good cause, extend the timelimit for completion of the review to 10 days after the imposition of pretrialconfinement.Action by 7-day reviewing officer.Upon completion of review, the reviewing officer shall approve continued confinement or order immediate release. If the reviewing officer orders immediate release, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the release, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.Memorandum.The 7-day reviewing officers conclusions, including the factual findings on which they are based, shall be set forth in a written memorandum. The memorandum shall also state whether the victim was notified of the review, was given the opportunity to confer with the representative of the command or counsel for the government, and was given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. A copy of the memorandum and all documents considered by the 7-day reviewing officer shall be maintained in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned and provided to the accused or the Government on request.Reconsideration of approval of continued confinement.The 7-day reviewing officer shall upon request, and after noticeto the parties, reconsider the decision to confine the prisoner based uponany significant information not previously considered.Review by military judge.Once the charges for which the accused has been confined are referredto trial, the military judge shall review the propriety of pretrial confinementupon motion for appropriate relief.Release. The military judge shall order release from pretrial confinementonly if:The 7-day reviewing officer's decision was an abuse of discretion,and there is not sufficient information presented to the military judge justifyingcontinuation of pretrial confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule;Information not presented to the 7-day reviewing officer establishes that the prisoner should be released under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule; orThe provisions of subsection (i)(1) or (2) of this rule have notbeen complied with and information presented to the military judge does notestablish sufficient grounds for continued confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B)of this rule.DiscussionUpon a motion for release from pretrial confinement, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the motion and any hearing, the right to confer with counsel representing the government, and the right to be reasonably heard. Inability to reasonably afford a victim these rights shall not delay the proceedings. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(8).Credit.The military judge shall order administrative credit under subsection(k) of this rule for any pretrial confinement served as a result of an abuseof discretion or failure to comply with the provisions of subsections (f),(h), or (i) of this rule.Remedy.The remedy for noncompliance with subsections (f), (h), (i), or(j) of this rule shall be an administrative credit against the sentence adjudgedfor any confinement served as the result of such noncompliance. Such creditshall be computed at the rate of 1 day credit for each day of confinementserved as a result of such noncompliance. The military judge may order additionalcredit for each day of pretrial confinement that involves an abuse of discretionor unusually harsh circumstances. This credit is to be applied in additionto any other credit the accused may be entitled as a result of pretrial confinementserved. This credit shall be applied first against any confinement adjudged.If no confinement is adjudged, or if the confinement adjudged is insufficient to offset all the credit to which the accused is entitled, the credit shallbe applied against hard labor without confinement, restriction, fine, andforfeiture of pay, in that order, using the conversion formula under R.C.M. 1003(b)(6) and (7). For purposes of this subsection, 1 day of confinementshall be equal to 1 day of total forfeiture or a like amount of fine. Thecredit shall not be applied against any other form of punishment. Confinement after release.No person whose release from pretrial confinement has been directed by a person authorized in subsection (g) of this rule may be confined again before completion of trial except upon the discovery, after the order of release, of evidence or of misconduct which, either alone or in conjunction with all other available evidence, justifies confinement.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 304(b) concerning who may order confinement.Exceptions.Operational necessity.The Secretary of Defense may suspend application of subsections (e)(2) and (3), (f), (h)(2)(A) and (C), and (i) of this rule to specificunits or in specified areas when operational requirements of such units or in such areas would make application of such provisions impracticable.At sea.Subsections (e)(2) and (3), (f), (h)(2)(C), and (i) of this ruleshall not apply in the case of a person on board a vessel at sea. In suchsituations, confinement on board the vessel at sea may continue only untilthe person can be transferred to a confinement facility ashore. Such transfershall be accomplished at the earliest opportunity permitted by the operationalrequirements and mission of the vessel. Upon such transfer the memorandumrequired by subsection (h)(2)(C) of this rule shall be transmitted to thereviewing officer under subsection (i) of this rule and shall include anexplanation of any delay in the transfer.Notice to victim of escaped prisoner.A victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner for which the prisoner has been placed in pretrial confinement has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the escape of the prisoner, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.DiscussionFor purposes of this rule, the term victim of an alleged offense means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ.DiscussionUnder this subsection the standards for confinement remain the same (although the circumstances giving rise to the exception could bear on theapplication of those standards). Also, pretrial confinement remains subjectto judicial review. The prisoner's commander still must determine whetherconfinement will continue under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule. The suspensionof subsection (h)(2)(A) of this rule removes the 72-hour requirement sincein a combat environment, the commander may not be available to comply withit. The commander must make the pretrial confinement decision as soon asreasonably possible, however. (This provision is not suspended under subsection(2) since the commander of a vessel is always available.)Initial dispositionWho may dispose of offenses.Each commander has discretion to dispose of offenses by membersof that command. Ordinarily the immediate commander of a person accused orsuspected of committing an offense triable by court-martial initially determineshow to dispose of that offense. A superior commander may withhold the authorityto dispose of offenses in individual cases, types of cases, or generally.A superior commander may not limit the discretion of a subordinate commanderto act on cases over which authority has not been withheld.DiscussionEach commander in the chain of command has independent, yet overlappingdiscretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that officer's authority.Normally, in keeping with the policy in subsection (b) of this rule, the initialdisposition decision is made by the official at the lowest echelon with thepower to make it. A decision by a commander ordinarily does not bar a differentdisposition by a superior authority. _See_ R.C.M. 401(c); 601(f).Once charges are referred to a court-martial by a convening authority competentto do so, they may be withdrawn from that court-martial only in accordancewith R.C.M. 604. 

_See_ Appendix 3 with respectto offenses for which coordination with the Department of Justice is required.Policy.Allegations of offenses should be disposed of in a timely mannerat the lowest appropriate level of disposition listed in subsection (c) ofthis rule.DiscussionThe disposition decision is one of the most important and difficult decisions facing a commander. Many factors must be taken into consideration and balanced, including, to the extent practicable, the nature of the offenses, any mitigating or extenuating circumstances, the views of the victim as to disposition, any recommendations made by subordinate commanders, the interest of justice, military exigencies, and the effect of the decision on the accused and the command. The goal should be a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair.

In deciding how an offense should be disposed of, factors the commander should consider, to the extent they are known, include:

(A) the nature of and circumstances surrounding the offense and the extent of the harm caused by the offense, including the offense's effect on morale, health, safety, welfare, and discipline;

(B) when applicable, the views of the victim as to disposition;

(C) existence of jurisdiction over the accused and the offense;

(D) availability and admissibility of evidence;

(E) the willingness of the victim or others to testify;

(F) cooperation of the accused in the apprehension or prosecution of another accused;

(G) possible improper motives or biases of the person(s) making the allegation(s);

(H) availability and likelihood of prosecution of the same or similar and related charges against the accused by another jurisdiction;

(I) appropriateness of the authorized punishment to the particular accused or offense.How offenses may be disposed of.Within the limits of the commander's authority, a commander maytake the actions set forth in this subsection to initially dispose of a chargeor suspected offense.DiscussionPrompt disposition of charges is essential. _See_ R.C.M.707 (speedy trial requirements). 

Before determining an appropriatedisposition, a commander should ensure that a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M.303 has been conducted. If charges have not already been preferred, the commandermay, if appropriate, prefer them and dispose of them under this rule. _
But see_ R.C.M. 601 (c) regarding disqualification of an accuser. 

Ifcharges have been preferred, the commander should ensure that the accusedhas been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308, and that charges are in properform. _ See_ R.C.M. 307. Each commander who forwards or disposesof charges may make minor changes therein. _See_ R.C.M. 603(a)and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge should be preferredanew. _See_ R.C.M. 603(d). 

When charges arebrought against two or more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, _
see_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3). If it appears that the accusedmay lack mental capacity to stand trial or may not have been mentally responsibleat the times of the offenses, _see_ R.C.M. 706; 909; 916(k).No action.A commander may decide to take no action on an offense. If charges have been preferred, they may be dismissed.DiscussionA decision to take no action or dismissal of charges at this stage does not bar later disposition of the offenses under subsection (c)(2) through (5) of this rule. 

_See_ R.C.M. 401(a) concerningwho may dismiss charges, and R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges. 

Whena decision is made to take no action, the accused should be informed.Administrative action.A commander may take or initiate administrative action, in addition to or instead of other action taken under this rule, subject to regulationsof the Secretary concerned. Administrative actions include corrective measuressuch as counseling, admonition, reprimand, exhortation, disapproval, criticism,censure, reproach, rebuke, extra military instruction, or the administrativewithholding of privileges, or any combination of the above.DiscussionOther administrative measures, which are subject to regulationsof the Secretary concerned, include matters related to efficiency reports,academic reports, and other ratings; rehabilitation and reassignment; careerfield reclassification; administrative reduction for inefficiency; bar toreenlistment; personnel reliability program reclassification; security classificationchanges; pecuniary liability for negligence or misconduct; and administrativeseparation.Nonjudicial punishment.A commander may consider the matter pursuant to Article 15, nonjudicialpunishment. _See_ Part V. Disposition of charges.Charges may be disposed of in accordance with R.C.M. 401.DiscussionIf charges have not been preferred, they may be preferred. _
See_ R.C.M. 307 concerning preferral of charges. However, _
see_ R.C.M. 601(c) concerning disqualification of an accuser. 

Chargesmay be disposed of by dismissing them, forwarding them to another commanderfor disposition, or referring them to a summary, special, or general court-martial.Before charges may be referred to a general court-martial, compliance withR.C.M. 405 and 406 is necessary. Therefore, if appropriate, an investigation under R.C.M. 405 may be directed. Additional guidance on these matters isfound in R.C.M. 401-407.Forwarding for disposition.A commander may forward a matter concerning an offense, or charges,to a superior or subordinate authority for disposition.DiscussionThe immediate commander may lack authority to take action whichthat commander believes is an appropriate disposition. In such cases, thematter should be forwarded to a superior officer with a recommendation asto disposition. _See also_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2) concerning forwardingcharges. If allegations are forwarded to a higher authority for disposition,because of lack of authority or otherwise, the disposition decision becomes a matter within the discretion of the higher authority. 

Amatter may be forwarded for other reasons, such as for investigation of allegationsand preferral of charges, if warranted (_see_ R.C.M. 303, 307), or so that a subordinate can dispose of the matter.National security matters.If a commander not authorized to convene general courts-martialfinds that an offense warrants trial by court-martial, but believes thattrial would be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to nationalsecurity, the matter shall be forwarded to the general court-martial conveningauthority for action under R.C.M. 407(b). Preferral of chargesWho may prefer charges.Any person subject to the code may prefer charges.DiscussionNo person may be ordered to prefer charges to which that personis unable to make truthfully the required oath. _See_ Article30(a) and subsection (b) of this rule. A person who has been the accuseror nominal accuser (_see_ Article 1(9)) may not also serveas the convening authority of a general or special court-martial to whichthe charges are later referred. _See_ Articles 22(b) and 23(b);R.C.M. 601; however, _see_ R.C.M. 1302(b) (summary court-martialconvening authority is not disqualified by being the accuser). A person authorizedto dispose of offenses (_see_ R.C.M. 306(a); 401404and 407) should not be ordered to prefer charges when this would disqualifythat person from exercising that person's authority or would improperly restrictthat person's discretion to act on the case. _See_ R.C.M.104 and 504(c). 

Charges may be preferred against a personsubject to trial by court-martial at any time but should be preferred withoutunnecessary delay. _See_ the statute of limitations prescribedby Article 43. Preferral of charges should not be unnecessarily delayed.When a good reason existsas when a person is permitted to continuea course of conduct so that a ringleader or other conspirators may also bediscovered or when a suspected counterfeiter goes uncharged until guiltyknowledge becomes apparenta reasonable delay is permissible. However, _
see_ R.C.M. 707 concerning speedy trial requirements.How charges are preferred; oath.A person who prefers charges must:Sign the charges and specifications under oath before a commissioned officer of the armed forces authorized to administer oaths; andState that the signer has personal knowledge of or has investigated the matters set forth in the charges and specifications and that they aretrue in fact to the best of that person's knowledge and belief.Discussion_See_ Article 136 for authority to administer oaths.The following form may be used to administer the oath:You (swear) (affirm) that you are a person subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, that you have personal knowledgeof or have investigated the matters set forth in the foregoing charge(s)and specification(s), and that the same are true in fact to the best of your knowledge and belief. (So help you God.) 

The accuser's belief may be based upon reportsof others in whole or in part.How to allege offenses.In general.The format of charge and specification is used to allege violationsof the code.Discussion_See_ Appendix 4 for a sample of a Charge Sheet (DDForm 458).Charge.A charge states the article of the code, law of war, or local penallaw of an occupied territory which the accused is alleged to have violated.DiscussionThe particular subdivision of an article of the code (for example,Article 118(1)) should not be included in the charge. When there are numerousinfractions of the same article, there will be only one charge, but severalspecifications thereunder. There may also be several charges, but each mustallege a violation of a different article of the code. For violations ofthe law of war, _see_ (D) below.Numbering charges.If there is only one charge, it is not numbered. When there ismore than one charge, each charge is numbered by a Roman numeral.Additional charges.Charges preferred after others have been preferred are labeled additionalcharges and are also numbered with Roman numerals, beginning withI if there is more than one additional charge. These ordinarilyrelate to offenses not known at the time or committed after the originalcharges were preferred. Additional charges do not require a separate trial if incorporated in the trial of the original charges before arraignment. _
See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2). Preemption.An offense specifically defined by Articles 81 through 132 may notbe alleged as a violation of Article 134. _See_ paragraph60c(5)(a) of Part IV. _But see_ subsection (d) of this rule.Charges under the law of war.In the case of a person subject to trial by general court-martialfor violations of the law of war (_see_ Article 18), the chargeshould be: Violation of the Law of War; or Violationof, referring tothe local penal law of the occupied territory. _See_ R.C.M.201(f)(1)(B). _But see_ subsection (d) of this rule. Ordinarilypersons subject to the code should be charged with a specific violation ofthe code rather than a violation of the law of war.Specification.A specification is a plain, concise, and definite statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. A specification is sufficient if it alleges every element of the charged offense expressly or by necessary implication; however, specifications under Article 134 must expressly allege the terminal element. Except for aggravating factors under R.C.M 1003(d) and R.C.M. 1004, facts that increase the maximum authorized punishment must be alleged in order to permit the possible increased punishment. No particular format is required.DiscussionHow to draft specifications. For Article 134 offenses, also refer to paragraph 60c(6) in Part IV.Sample specifications.Before drafting a specification, the drafter should read the pertinentprovisions of Part IV, where the elements of proof of various offenses andforms for specifications appear.

Note:  Be advised that the sample specifications in this Manual have not been amended to comport with _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010) and _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). Practitioners should read the notes above and draft specifications in conformity with the cases cited therein.Numbering specifications.If there is only one specification under a charge it is not numbered. When there is more than one specification under any charge, the specifications are numbered in Arabic numerals. The term additional is notused in connection with the specifications under an additional charge.Name and description of the accused.Name.The specification should state the accused's full name: first name,middle name or initial, last name. If the accused is known by more than onename, the name acknowledged by the accused should be used. If there is nosuch acknowledgment, the name believed to be the true name should be listedfirst, followed by all known aliases. For example: Seaman John P. Smith,U.S. Navy, alias Lt. Robert R. Brown, U.S. Navy.Military association.The specification should state the accused's rank or grade. If therank or grade of the accused has changed since the date of an alleged offense,and the change is pertinent to the offense charged, the accused should beidentified by the present rank or grade followed by rank or grade on thedate of the alleged offense. For example: In thatSeaman , then Seaman Apprentice, etc.Social security number or service number.The social security number or service number of an accused shouldnot be stated in the specification.Basis of personal jurisdiction.Military members on active duty.Ordinarily, no allegation of the accused's armed force or unit ororganization is necessary for military members on active duty.Persons subject to the code under Article 2(a), subsections (3) through (12), or subject to trial by court-martial under Articles 3 or 4.The specification should describe the accused's armed force, unitor organization, position, or status which will indicate the basis of jurisdiction.For example: John Jones, (a person employed by and serving with the U.S. Army in the field in time of war) (a person convicted of having obtained a fraudulentdischarge), etc.Date and time of offenseIn general.The date of the commission of the offense charged should be statedin the specification with sufficient precision to identify the offense andenable the accused to understand what particular act or omission to defendagainst.Use of on or about.In alleging the date of the offense it is proper to allege it ason or about a specified day.Hour.The exact hour of the offense is ordinarily not alleged exceptin certain absence offenses. When the exact time is alleged, the 24-hourclock should be used. The use of at or about is proper.Extended periods.When the acts specified extend(s) over a considerable period oftime it is proper to allege it (or them) as having occurred, for example,from about 15 June 1983 to about 4 November 1983, or didon divers occasions between 15 June 1983 and 4 November 1983.Place of offense.The place of the commission of the offense charged should be statedin the specification with sufficient precision to identify the offense andenable the accused to understand the particular act or omission to defendagainst. In alleging the place of the offense, it is proper to allege itas at or near a certain place if the exact place is uncertain.Subject-matter jurisdiction allegations.Pleading the accused's rank or grade along with the proper elementsof the offense normally will be sufficient to establish subject-matter jurisdiction.Description of offense.Elements.The elements of the offense must be alleged, either expressly or by necessary implication, except that Article 134 specifications must expressly allege the terminal element. _See_ paragraph 60.c.(6) in Part IV. If a specific intent, knowledge, or state of mind is an element of the offense, it must be alleged.Words indicating criminality.If the alleged act is not itself an offense but is made an offenseeither by applicable statute (including Articles 133 and 134), or regulationor custom having the effect of law, then words indicating criminality suchas wrongfully, unlawfully, or withoutauthority (depending upon the nature of the offense) should be usedto describe the accused's acts.Specificity.The specification should be sufficiently specific to inform theaccused of the conduct charged, to enable the accused to prepare a defense,and to protect the accused against double jeopardy. Only those facts thatmake the accused's conduct criminal ordinarily should be alleged. Specific evidence supporting the allegations ordinarily should not be included inthe specifications.Duplicitousness.One specification should not allege more than one offense, eitherconjunctively (the accused lost and destroyed) or alternatively(the accused lost or destroyed). However, if two acts or aseries of acts constitute one offense, they may be alleged conjunctively. _
See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(5).Lesser Included Offenses.The elements of the contemplated lesser included offense should be compared with the elements of the greater offense to determine if the elements of the lesser offense are derivative of the greater offense and vice versa. _See_ discussion following paragraph 3.b.(1)(c) in Part IV and the related analysis in Appendix 23.Other considerations in drafting specifications.Principals.All principals are charged as if each was the perpetrator. _
See_ paragraph 1 of Part IV for a discussion of principals.Victim.In the case of an offense against the person or property of a person,the first name, middle initial and last name of such person should be alleged,if known. If the name of the victim is unknown, a general physical descriptionmay be used. If this cannot be done, the victim may be described as aperson whose name is unknown. Military rank or grade should be alleged,and must be alleged if an element of the offense, as in an allegation ofdisobedience of the command of a superior officer. If the person has no militaryposition, it may otherwise be necessary to allege the status as in an allegationof using provoking words toward a person subject to the code. _ See
_ paragraph 42 of Part IV.Property.In describing property generic terms should be used, such as awatch or a knife, and descriptive details such as make,model, color, and serial number should ordinarily be omitted. In some instances,however, details may be essential to the offense, so they must be alleged.For example: the length of a knife blade may be important when alleging aviolation of general regulation prohibiting carrying a knife with a bladethat exceeds a certain length.Value.When the value of property or other amount determines the maximumpunishment which may be adjudged for an offense, the value or amount shouldbe alleged, for in such a case increased punishments that are contingentupon value may not be adjudged unless there is an allegation, as well asproof, of a value which will support the punishment. If several articlesof different kinds are the subject of the offense, the value of each articleshould be stated followed by a statement of the aggregate value. Exact valueshould be stated, if known. For ease of proof an allegation may be ofa value not less than. If only an approximatevalue is known, it may be alleged as of a value of about. If the value of an item is unknown but obviously minimal,the term of some value may be used. These principles apply toallegations of amounts.Documents.When documents other than regulations or orders must be alleged(for example, bad checks in violation of Article 123a), the document maybe set forth verbatim (including photocopies and similar reproductions) ormay be described, in which case the description must be sufficient to informthe accused of the offense charged.Orders.General orders.A specification alleging a violation of a general order or regulation(Article 92(1)) must clearly identify the specific order or regulation allegedlyviolated. The general order or regulation should be cited by its identifyingtitle or number, section or paragraph, and date. It is not necessary to recitethe text of the general order or regulation verbatim.Other orders.If the order allegedly violated is an other lawful order(Article 92(2)), it should be set forth verbatim or described in the specification.When the order is oral, _see_ (vii) below.Negating exceptions.If the order contains exceptions, it is not necessary that the specificationcontain a specific allegation negating the exceptions. However, words ofcriminality may be required if the alleged act is not necessarily criminal. _See_ subsection (G)(ii) of this discussion.Oral statements.When alleging oral statements the phrase or words to thateffect should be added.Joint offense.In the case of a joint offense each accused may be charged separatelyas if each accused acted alone or all may be charged together in a singlespecification. For example:If Doe and Roe are joint perpetrators of an offense and it is intendedto charge and try both at the same trial, they should be charged in a singlespecification as follows: 

Inthat Doe and Roe, acting jointly and pursuant to a common intent, did....If it is intended that Roe will be tried alone or that Roe willbe tried with Doe at a common trial, Roe may be charged in the same manneras if Roe alone had committed the offense. However, to show in the specificationthat Doe was a joint actor with Roe, even though Doe is not to be tried withRoe, Roe may be charged as follows: 

Inthat Roe did, in conjunction with Doe, ....Matters in aggravation.Matters in aggravation that do not increase the maximum authorizedpunishment ordinarily should not be alleged in the specification. Prior convictionsneed not be alleged in the specification to permit increased punishment.Aggravating factors in capital cases should not be alleged in the specification. Notice of such factors is normally provided in accordance with R.C.M. 1004(b)(1).Abbreviations.Commonly used and understood abbreviations may be used, particularly abbreviations for ranks, grades, units and organizations, components, and geographic or political entities, such as the names of states or countries.Multiple offenses.Charges and specifications alleging all known offenses by an accused may be preferred at the same time. Each specification shall state only one offense. What is substantially one transaction should not be made the basis for an unreasonable multiplication of charges against one person. Unreasonable multiplication of charges is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12); multiplicity is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B); and punishment limitations are addressed in R.C.M. 1003(c)(1)(C).DiscussionThe prohibition against unreasonable multiplication of charges addresses those features of military law that increase the potential for overreaching in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is based on reasonableness, and has no foundation in Constitutional rights. To determine if charges are unreasonably multiplied, see R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Because prosecutors are free to plead in the alternative, it may be reasonable to charge two or more offenses that arise from one transaction if sufficient doubt exists as to the facts or the law. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included offense thereof be separately charged. See also Part IV, paragraph 3, and R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.

_See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12) and 1003(c)(1)(C). For example, a person should not be charged with both failure to report for a routine scheduled duty,such as reveille, and with absence without leave if the failure to reportoccurred during the period for which the accused is charged with absence without leave. There are times, however, when sufficient doubt as to the facts orthe law exists to warrant making one transaction the basis for charging twoor more offenses. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included offense thereof be separately charged. 

_See also
_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.Multiple offenders.A specification may name more than one person as an accused if eachperson so named is believed by the accuser to be a principal in the offensewhich is the subject of the specification.Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 601(e)(3) concerning joinder ofaccused. 

A joint offense is one committed by two or morepersons acting together with a common intent. Principals may be charged jointlywith the commission of the same offense, but an accessory after the factcannot be charged jointly with the principal whom the accused is alleged tohave received, comforted, or assisted. Offenders are properly joined onlyif there is a common unlawful design or purpose; the mere fact that severalpersons happen to have committed the same kinds of offenses at the time, althoughmaterial as tending to show concert of purpose, does not necessarily establishthis. The fact that several persons happen to have absented themselves withoutleave at about the same time will not, in the absence of evidence indicatinga joint design, purpose, or plan justify joining them in one specification,for they may merely have been availing themselves of the same opportunity.In joint offenses the participants may be separately or jointly charged.However, if the participants are members of different armed forces, they mustbe charged separately because their trials must be separately reviewed. Thepreparation of joint charges is discussed in subsection (c)(3) Discussion(H) (viii)_(a)_ of this rule. The advantage of a joint charge is that all accused will be tried at one trial, thereby saving time, labor,and expense. This must be weighed against the possible unfairness to theaccused which may result if their defenses are inconsistent or antagonistic. An accused cannot be called as a witness except upon that accused's own request.If the testimony of an accomplice is necessary, the accomplice should notbe tried jointly with those against whom the accomplice is expected to testify. _

_See_ R.C.M.603 concerning amending specifications. 

_See_ R.C.M.906(b)(5) and (6) concerning motions to amend specifications and bills ofparticulars.Harmless error in citation.Error in or omission of the designation of the article of the codeor other statute, law of war, or regulation violated shall not be groundfor dismissal of a charge or reversal of a conviction if the error or omissiondid not prejudicially mislead the accused. Notification to accused of chargesImmediate commander.The immediate commander of the accused shall cause the accused tobe informed of the charges preferred against the accused, and the name ofthe person who preferred the charges and of any person who ordered the chargesto be preferred, if known, as soon as practicable.DiscussionWhen notice is given, a certificate to that effect on the ChargeSheet should be completed. _See_ Appendix 4.Commanders at higher echelons.When the accused has not been informed of the charges, commandersat higher echelons to whom the preferred charges are forwarded shall causethe accused to be informed of the matters required under subsection (a) ofthis rule as soon as practicable. Remedy.The sole remedy for violation of this rule is a continuance or recessof sufficient length to permit the accused to adequately prepare a defense,and no relief shall be granted upon a failure to comply with this rule unlessthe accused demonstrates that the accused has been hindered in the preparationof a defense. FORWARDING AND DISPOSITION OF CHARGESForwarding and disposition of charges in generalWho may dispose of charges.Only persons authorized to convene courts-martial or to administernonjudicial punishment under Article 15 may dispose of charges. A superiorcompetent authority may withhold the authority of a subordinate to dispose of charges in individual cases, types of cases, or generally.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 504 as to who may convene courts-martialand paragraph 2 of Part V as to who may administer nonjudicial punishment.If the power to convene courts-martial and to administer nonjudicial punishment has been withheld, a commander may not dispose of charges under this rule. 

Ordinarilycharges should be forwarded to the accused's immediate commander for initialconsideration as to disposition. Each commander has independent discretionto determine how charges will be disposed of, except to the extent that thecommander's authority has been withheld by superior competent authority. _
See also_ R.C.M. 104. 

Each commander who forwardsor disposes of charges may make minor changes therein. _See_ R.C.M.603(a) and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge shouldbe preferred anew. _See_ R.C.M. 603(d). If a commander is anaccuser (_see_ Article 1(9); 307(a)) that commander is ineligibleto refer such charges to a general or special court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 601(c). However, see R.C.M. 1302(b) (accuser may refer charges to a summarycourt-martial).Prompt determination.When a commander with authority to dispose of charges receives charges,that commander shall promptly determine what disposition will be made inthe interest of justice and discipline.DiscussionIn determining what level of disposition is appropriate, _
see_ R.C.M. 306(b) and (c). When charges are brought against twoor more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, _see_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3). If it appears that the accused may lack mental capacityto stand trial or may not have been mentally responsible at the times ofthe offenses, _see_ R.C.M. 706; 909; 916(k). 

Asto the rules concerning speedy trial, _see_ R.C.M. 707. _
See also_ Articles 10; 30; 33; 98. 

Before determiningan appropriate disposition, a commander who receives charges should ensurethat: (1) a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M. 303 has been conducted; (2) theaccused has been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308; and (3) the chargesare in proper form.How charges may be disposed of.Unless the authority to do so has been limited or withheld by superiorcompetent authority, a commander may dispose of charges by dismissing anyor all of them, forwarding any or all of them to another commander for disposition,or referring any or all of them to a court-martial which the commander isempowered to convene. Charges should be disposed of in accordance with thepolicy in R.C.M. 306(b).DiscussionA commander may dispose of charges individually or collectively.If charges are referred to a court-martial, ordinarily all known chargesshould be referred to a single court-martial. 

_See
_ Appendix 3 when the charges may involve matters in which the Departmentof Justice has an interest.Dismissal.When a commander dismisses charges further disposition under R.C.M.306(c) of the offenses is not barred.DiscussionCharges are ordinarily dismissed by lining out and initialing thedeleted specifications or otherwise recording that a specification is dismissed.When all charges and specifications are dismissed, the accuser and the accusedordinarily should be informed. 

A charge should be dismissedwhen it fails to state an offense, when it is unsupported by available evidence,or when there are other sound reasons why trial by court-martial is not appropriate. Before dismissing charges because trial would be detrimental to the prosecutionof a war or harmful to national security, _see_ R.C.M. 401(d);407(b). 

If the accused has already refused nonjudicial punishment,charges should not be dismissed with a view to offering nonjudicial punishmentunless the accused has indicated willingness to accept nonjudicial punishmentif again offered. The decision whether to dismiss charges in such circumstancesis within the sole discretion of the commander concerned. 

Chargesmay be amended in accordance with R.C.M. 603. 

It is appropriateto dismiss a charge and prefer another charge anew when, for example, theoriginal charge failed to state an offense, or was so defective that a majoramendment was required (_see_ R.C.M. 603(d)), or did not adequatelyreflect the nature or seriousness of the offense. 

_
See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C) concerning the effect of dismissing chargesafter the court-martial has begun.Forwarding charges.Forwarding to a superior commander.When charges are forwarded to a superior commander for disposition,the forwarding commander shall make a personal recommendation as to disposition.If the forwarding commander is disqualified from acting as convening authorityin the case, the basis for the disqualification shall be noted.DiscussionA commander's recommendation is within that commander's sole discretion.No authority may direct a commander to make a specific recommendation asto disposition. 

When charges are forwarded to a superiorcommander with a view to trial by general or special court-martial, theyshould be forwarded by a letter of transmittal or indorsement. To the extentpracticable without unduly delaying forwarding the charges, the letter shouldinclude or carry as enclosures: a summary of the available evidence relatingto each offense; evidence of previous convictions and nonjudicial punishments of the accused; an indication that the accused has been offered and refusednonjudicial punishment, if applicable; and any other matters required bysuperior authority or deemed appropriate by the forwarding commander. Othermatters which may be appropriate include information concerning the accused'sbackground and character of military service, and a description of any unusualcircumstances in the case. The summary of evidence should include availablewitness statements, documentary evidence, and exhibits. When practicable,copies of signed statements of the witnesses should be forwarded, as shouldcopies of any investigative or laboratory reports. Forwarding charges shouldnot be delayed, however, solely to obtain such statements or reports whenit otherwise appears that sufficient evidence to warrant trial is or willbe available in time for trial. If because of the bulk of documents or exhibits,it is impracticable to forward them with the letter of transmittal, theyshould be properly preserved and should be referred to in the letter of transmittal. 

Whenit appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings inthe case or that a deposition may be appropriate, that matter should be broughtto the attention of the convening authority promptly and should be notedin the letter of transmittal. 

When charges are forwardedwith a view to disposition other than trial by general or special court-martial,they should be accompanied by sufficient information to enable the authorityreceiving them to dispose of them without further investigation.Other cases.When charges are forwarded to a commander who is not a superiorof the forwarding commander, no recommendation as to disposition may be made.DiscussionExcept when directed to forward charges, a subordinate commandermay not be required to take any specific action to dispose of charges. _
See_ R.C.M. 104. _See also_ paragraph 1d(2) of PartV. When appropriate, charges may be sent or returned to a subordinate commanderfor compliance with procedural requirements. _See_, for example,R.C.M. 303 (preliminary inquiry); R.C.M. 308 (notification to accused of charges).Referral of charges._See_ R.C.M. 403, 404, 407, 601. National security matters.If a commander who is not a general court-martial convening authorityfinds that the charges warrant trial by court-martial but believes that trialwould probably be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to nationalsecurity, the charges shall be forwarded to the officer exercising generalcourt-martial convening authority.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 407(b).Action by commander not authorized to convene courts-martialWhen in receipt of charges, a commander authorized to administernonjudicial punishment but not authorized to convene courts-martial may:Dismiss any charges; orDiscussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,the effect of dismissal, and options for further action.Forward them to a superior commander for disposition.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2) for additional guidance concerning forwarding charges. _See generally_ R.C.M. 303 (preliminaryinquiry); 308 (notification to accused of charges) concerning other dutiesof the immediate commander when in receipt of charges.

The entryindicating receipt is important because it stops the running of the statuteof limitations. _See_ Article 43; R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B). Chargesmay be preferred and forwarded to an officer exercising summary court-martialjurisdiction over the command to stop the running of the statute of limitationseven though the accused is absent without authority.Disposition.When in receipt of charges a commander exercising summary court-martialjurisdiction may: Dismiss any charges;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,the effect of dismissing charges, and options for further action.Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to asubordinate commander for disposition; Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding chargesto a subordinate.

_ R.C.M. 1302(c) concerning referral of charges to a summary court-martial.Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct a preliminary hearing under R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward the report of preliminary hearing with the charges to a superior commander for disposition.DiscussionA preliminary hearing should be directed when it appears that the charges are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _See_ R.C.M. 405. If a preliminary hearing of the subject matter already has been conducted, see R.C.M. 405(b) and 405(e)(2).Disclosure of matters following direction of preliminary hearingWhen a convening authority directs a preliminary hearing under R.C.M. 405, counsel forthe government shall, subject to R.C.M. 404A(b)(d) below, within 5 days of issuance of the Article 32 appointing order, provide to the defense the following information or matters:Charge sheet;Article 32 appointing order;Documents accompanying the charge sheet on which the preferral decision was based;Documents provided to the convening authority when deciding to direct the preliminary hearing;Documents the counsel for the government intends to present at the preliminary hearing; andAccess to tangible objects counsel for the government intends to present at the preliminary hearing.Contraband.If items covered by subsection 404A(a) above are contraband, the disclosure required under this rule is a reasonable opportunity to inspect said contraband prior to the hearing.Privilege.If items covered by subsection 404A(a) above are privileged, classified or otherwise protected under Section V of Part III, no disclosure of those items is required under this rule. However, counsel for the government may disclose privileged, classified, or otherwise protected information covered by subsection 404A(a) above if authorized by the holder of the privilege, or in the case of Mil. R. Evid. 505 or 506, if authorized by a competent authority.Protective order if privileged information is disclosed.If the government agrees to disclose to the accused information to which the protections afforded by Section V of Part III may apply, the convening authority, or other person designated by regulation of the Secretary concerned, may enter an appropriate protective order, in writing, to guard against the compromise of information disclosed to the accused. The terms of any such protective order may include prohibiting the disclosure of the information except as authorized by the authority issuing the protective order, as well as those terms specified by Mil. R. Evid. 505(g)(2)(6) or 506(g)(2)(5).DiscussionThe purposes of this rule are to provide the accused with the documents used to make the determination to prefer charges and direct a preliminary hearing, and to allow the accused to prepare for the preliminary hearing. This rule is not intended to be a tool for discovery and does not impose the same discovery obligations found in R.C.M. 405 prior to amendments required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 or R.C.M. 701. Additional rules for disclosure of witnesses and other evidence in the preliminary hearing are provided in R.C.M. 405(g).Preliminary hearingIn general.Except as provided in subsection (k) of this rule, no charge or specification may be referred to a general court-martial for trial until completion of a preliminary hearing in substantial compliance with this rule. A preliminary hearing conducted under this rule is not intended to serve as a means of discovery and will be limited to an examination of those issues necessary to determine whether there is probable cause to conclude that an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it; to determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; to consider the form of the charge(s); and to recommend the disposition that should be made of the charge(s). Failure to comply with this rule shall have no effect on the disposition of the charge(s) if the charge(s) is not referred to a general court-martial.DiscussionThe function of the preliminary hearing is to ascertain and impartially weigh the facts needed for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing is not intended to perfect a case against the accused and is not intended to serve as a means of discovery or to provide a right of confrontation required at trial. Determinations and recommendations of the preliminary hearing officer are advisory.

Failure to substantially comply with the requirements of Article 32, which failure prejudices the accused, may result in delay in disposition of the case or disapproval of the proceedings. See R.C.M. 905(b)(1) and 906(b)(3) concerning motions for appropriate relief relating to the preliminary hearing.

The accused may waive the preliminary hearing. See subsection (k) of this rule. In such case, no preliminary hearing need be held. However, the convening authority authorized to direct the preliminary hearing may direct that it be conducted notwithstanding the waiver.Earlier preliminary hearing.If a preliminary hearing of the subject matter of an offense has been conducted before the accused is charged with an offense, and the accused was present at the preliminary hearing and afforded the rights to counsel, cross-examination, and presentation of evidence required by this rule, no further preliminary hearing is required. Who may direct a preliminary hearing.Unless prohibited by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a preliminary hearing may be directed under this rule by any court-martial convening authority. That authority may also give procedural instructions not inconsistent with these rules. Personnel.Preliminary hearing officer.Whenever practicable, the convening authority directing a preliminary hearing under this rule shall detail an impartial judge advocate certified under Article 27(b), not the accuser, as a preliminary hearing officer, who shall conduct the preliminary hearing and make a report that addresses whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense or offenses have been committed and that the accused committed the offense(s); whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; the form of the charges(s); and a recommendation as to the disposition of the charge(s).

When the appointment of a judge advocate as the preliminary hearing officer is not practicable, or in exceptional circumstances in which the interest of justice warrants, the convening authority directing the preliminary hearing may detail an impartial commissioned officer, who is not the accuser, as the preliminary hearing officer. If the preliminary hearing officer is not a judge advocate, an impartial judge advocate certified under Article 27(b) shall be available to provide legal advice to the preliminary hearing officer.

When practicable, the preliminary hearing officer shall be equal or senior in grade to the military counsel detailed to represent the accused and the government at the preliminary hearing. The Secretary concerned may prescribe additional limitations on the appointment of preliminary hearing officers.

The preliminary hearing officer shall not depart from an impartial role and become an advocate for either side. The preliminary hearing officer is disqualified to act later in the same case in any other capacity.DiscussionThe preliminary hearing officer, if not a judge advocate, should be an officer in the grade of O-4 or higher. The preliminary hearing officer may seek legal advice concerning the preliminary hearing officers responsibilities from an impartial source, but may not obtain such advice from counsel for any party or counsel for a victim.Counsel to represent the United States.A judge advocate, not the accuser, shall serve as counsel to represent the United States, and shall present evidence on behalf of the government relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing as set forth in subsection (a) of this rule.Defense counsel.The commander who directed the investigation may also, as a matterof discretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail:Detailed counsel.Except as provided in subsection (d)(3)(B) of this rule, military counsel certified in accordance with Article 27(b) shall be detailed to represent the accused. Individual military counsel.The accused may request to be represented by individual military counsel. Such requests shall be acted on in accordance with R.C.M. 506(b). Civilian counsel.The accused may be represented by civilian counsel at no expense to the United States. Upon request, the accused is entitled to a reasonable time to obtain civilian counsel and to have such counsel present for the preliminary hearing. However, the preliminary hearing shall not be unduly delayed for this purpose. Representation by civilian counsel shall not limit the rights to military counsel under subsections (d)(3)(A) and (B) of this rule. Others.The convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing may also, as a matter of discretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail:A reporter; and An interpreter. Scope of preliminary hearing.The preliminary hearing officer shall limit the inquiry to the examination of evidence, including witnesses, necessary to:Determine whether there is probable cause to believe an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it;Determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused;Consider whether the form of the charge(s) is proper; andMake a recommendation as to the disposition of the charge(s). If evidence adduced during the preliminary hearing indicates that the accused committed any uncharged offense(s), the preliminary hearing officer may examine evidence and hear witnesses relating to the subject matter of such offense(s) and make the findings and recommendations enumerated in subsection (e)(1) of this rule regarding such offense(s) without the accused first having been charged with the offense. The accuseds rights under subsection (f)(2) of this rule, and, where it would not cause undue delay to the proceedings, subsection (g) of this rule, are the same with regard to both charged and uncharged offenses. When considering uncharged offenses identified during the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing officer shall inform the accused of the general nature of each uncharged offense considered, and otherwise afford the accused the same opportunity for representation, cross examination, and presentation afforded during the preliminary hearing of any charged offense.DiscussionExcept as set forth in subsection (h) below, the Mil. R. Evid. do not apply at a preliminary hearing. Except as prohibited elsewhere in this rule, a preliminary hearing officer may consider evidence, including hearsay, which would not be admissible at trial.Rights of the accused.Prior to any preliminary hearing under this rule the accused shall have the right to:Notice of any witnesses that the government intends to call at the preliminary hearing and copies of or access to any written or recorded statements made by those witnesses that relate to the subject matter of any charged offense; For purposes of this rule, a written statement is one that is signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government; andFor purposes of this rule, a recorded statement is an oral statement made by the witness that is recorded contemporaneously with the making of the oral statement and contained in a digital or other recording or a transcription thereof that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government. Notice of, and reasonable access to, any other evidence that the government intends to offer at the preliminary hearing; andNotice of, and reasonable access to, evidence that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government that negates or reduces the degree of guilt of the accused for an offense charged.At any preliminary hearing under this rule the accused shall have the right to:Be advised of the charges under consideration;Be represented by counsel;Be informed of the purpose of the preliminary hearing;Be informed of the right against self-incrimination under Article 31;Except in the circumstances described in R.C.M. 804(c)(2), be present throughout the taking of evidence;Cross-examine witnesses on matters relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing;Present matters in defense and mitigation relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing; andDiscussionUnsworn statements by the accused, unlike those made under R.C.M. 1001(c)(2), shall be limited to matters in defense and mitigation.Make a statement relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.Production of Witnesses and Other Evidence.Military Witnesses.Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government the names of proposed military witnesses whom the accused requests that the government produce to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the requested form of the testimony, in accordance with the timeline established by the preliminary hearing officer. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the witnesss testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and will seek to secure the witnesss testimony for the hearing; or (2) the government objects to the proposed defense witness on the grounds that the testimony would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.If the government objects to the proposed defense witness, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. If the government does not object to the proposed defense military witness or the preliminary hearing officer determines that the military witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary, counsel for the government shall request that the commanding officer of the proposed military witness make that person available to provide testimony. The commanding officer shall determine whether the individual is available based on operational necessity or mission requirements, except that a victim, as defined in this rule, who declines to testify shall be deemed to be not available. If the commanding officer determines that the military witness is available, counsel for the government shall make arrangements for that individuals testimony. The commanding officers determination of unavailability due to operational necessity or mission requirements is final. The military witnesss commanding officer determines the availability of the witness and, if there is a dispute among the parties, determines whether the witness testifies in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony.DiscussionA commanding officers determination of whether an individual is available, as well as the means by which the individual is available, is a balancing test. The more important the testimony of the witness, the greater the difficulty, expense, delay, or effect on military operations must be to deny production of the witness. Based on operational necessity and mission requirements, the witnesss commanding officer may authorize the witness to testify by video teleconference, telephone, or similar means of remote testimony. Factors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; and the likelihood of significant interference with operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.Civilian Witnesses.Military witnesses.Defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government the names of proposed civilian witnesses whom the accused requests that the government produce to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the requested form of the testimony, in accordance with the timeline established by the preliminary hearing officer. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the witnesss testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and will seek to secure the witnesss testimony for the hearing; or (2) the government objects to the proposed defense witness on the grounds that the testimony would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.If the government objects to the proposed defense witness, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.Evidence generally.If the government does not object to the proposed civilian witness or the preliminary hearing officer determines that the civilian witnesss testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary, counsel for the government shall invite the civilian witness to provide testimony and, if the individual agrees, shall make arrangements for that witnesss testimony. If expense to the government is to be incurred, the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, or the convening authoritys delegate, shall determine whether the witness testifies in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony.DiscussionFactors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-person testimony. Civilian witnesses may not be compelled to provide testimony at a preliminary hearing. Civilian witnesses may be paid for travel and associated expenses to testify at a preliminary hearing. _See_ Department of Defense Joint Travel Regulations.Other evidence.Evidence under the control of the government.Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government a list of evidence under the control of the government the accused requests the government produce to the defense for introduction at the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer may set a deadline by which defense requests must be received. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the evidence; or (2) the government objects to production of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.If the government objects to production of the evidence, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the evidence should be produced.  The preliminary hearing officer shall determine whether the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the hearing. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that the evidence shall be produced, counsel for the government shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the evidence.Evidence not under the control of the government.Evidence not under the control of the government may be obtained through noncompulsory means or by _subpoenas duces tecum_ issued by counsel for the government in accordance with the process established by R.C.M. 703.Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government a list of evidence not under the control of the government that the accused requests the government obtain. The preliminary hearing officer may set a deadline by which defense requests must be received. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ for the evidence; or (2) the government objects to production of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. If the government objects to production of the evidence, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the evidence should be produced.  If the preliminary hearing officer determines that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and that the issuance of _subpoenas duces tecum_ would not cause undue delay to the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing officer shall direct counsel for the government to issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ for the defense-requested evidence. Failure on the part of counsel for the government to issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ directed by the preliminary hearing officer shall be noted by the preliminary hearing officer in the report of preliminary hearing.DiscussionA _subpoena duces tecum_ to produce books, papers, documents, data, electronically stored information, or other objects for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 may be issued by counsel for the government. The preliminary hearing officer has no authority to issue a _subpoena duces tecum_. However, the preliminary hearing officer may direct counsel for the government to issue a _subpoena duces tecum_ for defense-requested evidence.Military Rules of Evidence.The Military Rules of Evidence do not apply in preliminary hearings under this rule except as follows:Mil. R. Evid. 301-303 and 305 shall apply in their entirety.Mil. R. Evid. 412 shall apply in any case that includes a charge defined as a sexual offense in Mil. R. Evid. 412(d), except that Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) shall not apply.Mil. R. Evid., Section V, Privileges, shall apply, except that Mil. R. Evid. 505(f)-(h) and (j); 506(f)-(h), (j), (k), and (m); and 514(d)(6) shall not apply.In applying these rules to a preliminary hearing, the term military judge, as used in these rules, shall mean the preliminary hearing officer, who shall assume the military judges authority to exclude evidence from the preliminary hearing, and who shall, in discharging this duty, follow the procedures set forth in the rules cited in subsections (h)(1)-(3) of this rule. However, the preliminary hearing officer is not authorized to order production of communications covered by Mil. R. Evid. 513 and 514.DiscussionThe prohibition against ordering production of evidence does not preclude a preliminary hearing officer from considering evidence offered by the parties under Mil. R. Evid. 513 or 514.Failure to meet the procedural requirements of the applicable rules of evidence shall result in exclusion of that evidence from the preliminary hearing, unless good cause is shown.DiscussionBefore considering evidence offered under subsection (h)(2), the preliminary hearing officer must determine that the evidence offered is relevant for the limited scope and purpose of the hearing, that the evidence is proper under subsection (h)(2), and that the probative value of such evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the alleged victims privacy. The preliminary hearing officer shall set forth any limitations on the scope of such evidence.

Evidence offered under subsection (h)(2) above must be protected pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.  552a. Although Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) allows admission of evidence of the victims sexual behavior or predisposition at trial when it is constitutionally required, there is no constitutional requirement at an Article 32 hearing. There is likewise no constitutional requirement for a pretrial hearing officer to consider evidence under Mil. R. Evid. 514(d)(6) at an Article 32 hearing. Evidence deemed admissible by the preliminary hearing officer should be made a part of the report of preliminary hearing. _See_ subsection (j)(2)(C), _infra_. Evidence not considered, and the testimony taken during a closed hearing, should not be included in the report of preliminary hearing but should be appropriately safeguarded or sealed. The preliminary hearing officer and counsel representing the government are responsible for careful handling of any such evidence to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure.Procedure.Generally. The preliminary hearing shall begin with the preliminary hearing officer informing the accused of the accuseds rights under subsection (f) of this rule. Counsel for the government will then present evidence. Upon the conclusion of counsel for the governments presentation of evidence, defense counsel may present matters in defense and mitigation consistent with subsection (f) of this rule. For the purposes of this rule, matters in mitigation are defined as matters that may serve to explain the circumstances surrounding a charged offense. Both counsel for the government and defense shall be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The preliminary hearing officer may also question witnesses called by the parties. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that additional evidence is necessary to satisfy the requirements of subsection (e) above, the preliminary hearing officer may provide the parties an opportunity to present additional testimony or evidence relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer shall not consider evidence not presented at the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer shall not call witnesses _sua sponte_.DiscussionA preliminary hearing officer may only consider evidence within the limited purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall ensure that the scope of the hearing is limited to that purpose. When the preliminary hearing officer finds that evidence offered by either party is not within the scope of the hearing, he shall inform the parties and halt the presentation of that information.Notice to and presence of the victim(s).The victim(s) of an offense under the UCMJ has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of a preliminary hearing relating to the alleged offense and the reasonable right to confer with counsel for the government. For the purposes of this rule, a victim is a person who is alleged to have suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the matters set forth in a charge or specification under consideration and is named in one of the specifications under consideration. A victim of an offense under consideration at the preliminary hearing is not required to testify at the preliminary hearing.A victim has the right not to be excluded from any portion of a preliminary hearing related to the alleged offense, unless the preliminary hearing officer, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines the testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at the proceeding.A victim shall be excluded if a privilege set forth in Mil. R. Evid. 505 or 506 is invoked or if evidence is offered under Mil. R. Evid. 412, 513, or 514, for charges other than those in which the victim is named.Presentation of evidence. Testimony. Witness testimony may be provided in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony. All testimony shall be taken under oath, except that the accused may make an unsworn statement. The preliminary hearing officer shall only consider testimony that is relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.DiscussionThe following oath may be given to witnesses:

Do you (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you God)?

The preliminary hearing officer is required to include in the report of the preliminary hearing, at a minimum, a summary of the substance of all testimony. See subsection (j)(2)(B) of this rule.

All preliminary hearing officer notes of testimony and recordings of testimony should be preserved until the end of trial.

If during the preliminary hearing any witness subject to the Code is suspected of an offense under the Code, the preliminary hearing officer should comply with the warning requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 305(c), (d), and, if necessary, (e).

Bearing in mind that counsel are responsible for preparing and presenting their cases, the preliminary hearing officer may ask a witness questions relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the hearing. When questioning a witness, the preliminary hearing officer may not depart from an impartial role and become an advocate for either side.Other evidence. If relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing, and not cumulative, a preliminary hearing officer may consider other evidence, in addition to or in lieu of witness testimony, including statements, tangible evidence, or reproductions thereof, offered by either side, that the preliminary hearing officer determines is reliable. This other evidence need not be sworn.Access by spectators. Access by spectators to all or part of the proceedings may be restricted or foreclosed in the discretion of the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing or the preliminary hearing officer. Preliminary hearings are public proceedings and should remain open to the public whenever possible. When an overriding interest exists that outweighs the value of an open preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing may be closed to spectators. Any closure must be narrowly tailored to achieve the overriding interest that justified the closure. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conclude that no lesser methods short of closing the preliminary hearing can be used to protect the overriding interest in the case. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conduct a case-by-case, witness-by-witness, circumstance-by-circumstance analysis of whether closure is necessary. If a convening authority or preliminary hearing officer believes closing the preliminary hearing is necessary, the convening authority or preliminary hearing officer must make specific findings of fact in writing that support the closure. The written findings of fact must be included in the report of preliminary hearing. Examples of overriding interests may include: preventing psychological harm or trauma to a child witness or an alleged victim of a sexual crime, protecting the safety or privacy of a witness or alleged victim, protecting classified material, and receiving evidence where a witness is incapable of testifying in an open setting. Presence of accused. The further progress of the taking of evidence shall not be prevented and the accused shall be considered to have waived the right to be present whenever the accused: After being notified of the time and place of the proceeding is voluntarily absent; or After being warned by the preliminary hearing officer that disruptive conduct will cause removal from the proceeding, persists in conduct which is such as to justify exclusion from the proceeding. Recording of the preliminary hearing. Counsel for the government shall ensure that the preliminary hearing is recorded by a suitable recording device. A victim, as defined by subsection (i)(2)(A) of this rule, may request access to, or a copy of, the recording of the proceedings. Upon request, counsel for the government shall provide the requested access to, or a copy of, the recording to the victim not later than a reasonable time following dismissal of the charges, unless charges are dismissed for the purpose of re-referral, or court-martial adjournment. A victim is not entitled to classified information or access to or a copy of a recording of closed sessions which the victim did not have the right to attend under subsections (i)(2)(C) or (i)(2)(D) of this rule. DiscussionCounsel for the government shall provide victims with access to, or a copy of, the recording of the proceedings in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe.Objections. Any objection alleging failure to comply with this rule shall be made to the convening authority via the preliminary hearing officer. Sealed exhibits and proceedings. The preliminary hearing officer has the authority to order exhibits, proceedings, or other matters sealed as described in R.C.M. 1103A.  Report of preliminary hearing.In general.The preliminary hearing officer shall make a timely written report of the preliminary hearing to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing. DiscussionIf practicable, the charges and the report of preliminary hearing should be forwarded to the general court-martial convening authority within 8 days after an accused is ordered into arrest or confinement. _See_ Article 33, UCMJ.Contents.The report of preliminary hearing shall include: A statement of names and organizations or addresses of defense counsel and whether defense counsel was present throughout the taking of evidence, or if not present the reason why; The substance of the testimony taken on both sides; Any other statements, documents, or matters considered by the preliminary hearing officer, or recitals of the substance or nature of such evidence; A statement that an essential witness may not be available for trial; An explanation of any delays in the preliminary hearing; A notation if counsel for the government failed to issue a subpoena duces tecum that was directed by the preliminary hearing officer; The preliminary hearing officers determination as to whether there is probable cause to believe the offense(s) listed on the charge sheet or otherwise considered at the preliminary hearing occurred; The preliminary hearing officers determination as to whether there is probable cause to believe the accused committed the offense(s) listed on the charge sheet or otherwise considered at the preliminary hearing; The preliminary hearing officers determination as to whether a court-martial has jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused;The preliminary hearing officers determination as to whether the charge(s) and specification(s) are in proper form; and The recommendations of the preliminary hearing officer regarding disposition of the charge(s).DiscussionThe preliminary hearing officer may include any additional matters useful to the convening authority in determining disposition. The preliminary hearing officer may recommend that the charges and specifications be amended or that additional charges be preferred. _See_ R.C.M. 306 and 401 concerning other possible dispositions.Sealed exhibits and proceedings.. If the report of preliminary hearing contains exhibits, proceedings, or other matters ordered sealed by the preliminary hearing officer in accordance with R.C.M. 1103A, counsel for the government shall cause such materials to be sealed so as to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure.Distribution of the report. The preliminary hearing officer shall cause the report to be delivered to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing. That convening authority shall promptly cause a copy of the report to be delivered to each accused. Objections.Any objection to the report shall be made to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, via the preliminary hearing officer, within 5 days of its receipt by the accused. This subsection does not prohibit a convening authority from referring the charge(s) or taking other action within the 5-day period. Waiver.The accused may waive a preliminary hearing under this rule. In addition, failure to make a timely objection under this rule, including an objection to the report, shall constitute waiver of the objection. Relief from the waiver may be granted by the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, a superior convening authority, or the military judge, as appropriate, for good cause shown.Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3).

The convening authority who receives an objection may direct that the preliminary hearing be reopened or take other action, as appropriate.Pretrial adviceIn general.Before any charge may be referred for trial by a general court-martial,it shall be referred to the staff judge advocate of the convening authorityfor consideration and advice.DiscussionA pretrial advice need not be prepared in cases referred to specialor summary courts-martial. A convening authority may, however, seek the adviceof a lawyer before referring charges to such a court-martial. When chargeshave been withdrawn from a general court-martial (_see_ R.C.M.604) or when a mistrial has been declared in a general court-martial (_
see_ R.C.M. 915), supplementary advice is necessary before the chargesmay be referred to another general court-martial. 

The staffjudge advocate may make changes in the charges and specifications in accordance with R.C.M. 603.Contents.The advice of the staff judge advocate shall include a written andsigned statement which sets forth that person's: Conclusion with respect to whether each specification alleges an offense under the code; Conclusion with respect to whether the allegation of each offenseis warranted by the evidence indicated in the report of preliminary hearing (ifthere is such a report); Conclusion with respect to whether a court-martial would have jurisdictionover the accused and the offense; and Recommendation of the action to be taken by the convening authority.DiscussionThe staff judge advocate is personally responsible for the pretrialadvice and must make an independent and informed appraisal of the chargesand evidence in order to render the advice. Another person may prepare theadvice, but the staff judge advocate is, unless disqualified, responsiblefor it and must sign it personally. Grounds for disqualification in a caseinclude previous action in that case as preliminary hearing officer, military judge,trial counsel, defense counsel, or member.

The advice need not set forth the underlying analysis or rationale for its conclusions. Ordinarily, the charge sheet, forwarding letter, endorsements, and report of investigationare forwarded with the pretrial advice. In addition, the pretrial adviceshould include when appropriate: a brief summary of the evidence; discussionof significant aggravating, extenuating, or mitigating factors; any recommendationsfor disposition of the case by commanders or others who have forwarded thecharges; and the recommendation of the Article 32 preliminary hearing officer.However, there is no legal requirement to include such information, and failureto do so is not error. 

Whatever matters are included inthe advice, whether or not they are required, should be accurate. Informationwhich is incorrect or so incomplete as to be misleading may result in a determinationthat the advice is defective, necessitating appropriate relief. _
See_ R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3).

The standard of proof to be applied in R.C.M. 406(b)(2) is probable cause. _See_ R.C.M. 601(d)(1). Defects in the pretrial advice are not jurisdictional and are raisedby pretrial motion. _See_ R.C.M.905(b)(1) and its Discussion.Distribution.A copy of the advice of the staff judge advocate shall be providedto the defense if charges are referred to trial by general court-martial.Action by commander exercising general court-martial jurisdictionDisposition.When in receipt of charges, a commander exercising general court-martialjurisdiction may: Dismiss any charges;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of chargesand the effect of dismissing charges.Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to asubordinate commander for disposition; Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding chargesto a subordinate. 

A subordinate commander may not be requiredto take any specific action or to dispose of charges. _See_ R.C.M.104. _See also_ paragraph 1d(2) of Part V. When appropriate,charges may be sent or returned to a subordinate commander for compliancewith procedural requirements. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 303(preliminary inquiry); R.C.M. 308 (notification to accused of charges).Forward any charges to a superior commander for disposition;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401 (c)(2)(A) for guidance concerningforwarding charges to a superior.Refer charges to a summary court-martial or a special court-martial for trial;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 601; 1302(c).Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct apretrial investigation under R.C.M. 405, after which additional action underthis rule may be taken;DiscussionAn investigation should be directed when it appears the chargesare of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _
See_ R.C.M. 405. If an investigation of the subject matter alreadyhas been conducted. _See_ R.C.M. 405(b).Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a general court-martial.Discussion_See_ Article 22 and R.C.M. 504(b)(1) concerning whomay exercise general court-martial jurisdiction.

See_ R.C.M. 601 concerning referral of charges. _See_ R.C.M.306 and 401 concerning other dispositions.National security matters.When in receipt of charges the trial of which the commander exercisinggeneral court-martial jurisdiction finds would probably be inimical to theprosecution of a war or harmful to national security, that commander, unlessotherwise prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned, shall determinewhether trial is warranted and, if so, whether the security considerationsinvolved are paramount to trial. As the commander finds appropriate, thecommander may dismiss the charges, authorize trial of them, or forward themto a superior authority.DiscussionIn time of war, charges may be forwarded to the Secretary concerned for disposition under Article 43(e). Under Article 43(e), the Secretary may take action suspending the statute of limitations in time of war.COURT-MARTIAL COMPOSITION AND PERSONNEL; CONVENING COURTS-MARTIALComposition and personnel of courts-martialComposition of courts-martial.General courts-martial.Except in capital cases, general courts-martial shall consist of a military judge andnot less than five members, or of the military judge alone if requested and approvedunder R.C.M. 903.In all capital cases, general courts-martial shall consist of a military judge and nofewer than 12 members, unless 12 members are not reasonably available because ofphysical conditions or military exigencies.
