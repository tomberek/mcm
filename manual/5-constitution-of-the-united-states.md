association with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not members of

 the armed forces. 

## &sect; 813. Punishment prohibited before trial

No person, while being held for trial, may be subjected to punishment

or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon the charges pending against

to minor punishment during that period for infractions of discipline. 

## &sect; 814. Delivery of offenders to civil authorities

(a) Under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe,

a member of the armed forces accused of an offense against civil authority

by conviction in a civil tribunal, interrupts the execution of the sentence

of the court-martial, and the offender after having answered to the civil

authorities for his offense shall, upon the request of competent military

authority, be returned to military custody for the completion of his sentence.

# NON-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT

## &sect; 815. Commanding Officer's non-judicial punishment

(a) Under such regulations as the President may prescribe, and under

such additional regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary concerned,

limitations may be placed on the powers granted by this article with respect

to the kind and amount of punishment authorized, the categories of commanding

officers and warrant officers exercising command authorized to exercise those

powers, the applicability of this article to an accused who demands trial

by court-martial, and the kinds of courts-martial to which the case may be

referred upon such a demand. However, except in the case of a member attached

to or embarked in a vessel, punishment may not be imposed upon any member

of the armed forces under this article if the member has, before the imposition

of such punishment, demanded trial by court-martial in lieu of such punishment.

 Under similar regulations, rules may be prescribed with respect to the suspension

of punishments authorized hereunder. If authorized by regulations of the

Secretary concerned, a commanding officer exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction or an officer of general or flag rank in command may delegate

his powers under this article to a principal assistant. 

(b) Subject to subsection (a) any commanding officer may, in addition

to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, impose one or more of the following

disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a

court-martial- 

(1) upon officers of his command 

(A) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension

from duty, for not more than 30 consecutive days; 

(B) if imposed by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction

or an officer of general or flag rank in command 

(i) arrest in quarters for not more than 30 consecutive days; 

(ii) forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month's pay per month

for two months; 

(iii) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension

from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days; 

(iv) detention of not more than one-half of one month's pay per month

for three months; 

(2) upon other personnel of his command- 

(A) if imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, confinement

on bread and water or diminished rations for not more than three consecutive

days; 

(B) correctional custody for not more than seven consecutive days;

(C) forfeiture of not more than seven days' pay; 

(D) reduction to the next inferior pay grade, if the grade from which

demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction

or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction; 

(E) extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than

14 consecutive days; 

(F) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension

from duty, for not more than 14 consecutive days; 

(G) detention of not more than 14 days' pay; 

(H) if imposed by an officer of the grade of major or lieutenant commander,

or above 

(i) the punishment authorized under clause (A); 

(ii) correctional custody for not more than 30 consecutive days; 

(iii) forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month's pay per month

for two months; 

(iv) reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade

from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing

the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction,

but an enlisted member in a pay grade above E4 may not be reduced more than

two pay grades; 

(v) extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than

45 consecutive days; 

(vi) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension

from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days; 

(vii) detention of not more than one-half of one month's pay per month

for three months. 

Detention of pay shall be for a stated period of

not more than one year but if the offender's term of service expires earlier,

the detention shall terminate upon that expiration. No two or more of the

punishments of arrest in quarters, confinement on bread and water or diminished

rations, correctional custody, extra duties, and restriction may be combined

to run consecutively in the maximum amount imposable for each. Whenever

any of those punishments are combined to run consecutively, there must be

an apportionment. In addition, forfeiture of pay may not be combined with

detention of pay without an apportionment. For the purpose of this subsection,

 "correctional custody"  is the physical restraint of a person

during duty or nonduty hours and may include extra duties, fatigue duties,

or hard labor. If practicable, correctional custody will not be served in

immediate association with persons awaiting trial or held in confinement

 pursuant to trial by court-martial. 

(c) An officer in charge may impose upon enlisted members assigned

to the unit of which he is in charge such of the punishments authorized under

subsection (b)(2)(A)-(G) as the Secretary concerned may specifically prescribe

by regulation. 

(d) The officer who imposes the punishment authorized in subsection

(b), or his successor in command, may, at any time, suspend probationally

any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend

probationally a reduction in grade or a forfeiture imposed under subsection

(b), whether or not executed. In addition, he may, at any time, remit or

mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may

set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted,

and restore all rights, privileges and property affected. He may also mitigate

 reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay. When mitigating-

(1) arrest in quarters to restriction; 

(2) confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to correctional

custody; 

(3) correctional custody or confinement on bread and water or diminished

rations to extra duties or restriction, or both; or 

(4) extra duties to restriction; the mitigated punishment shall not

be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated.When mitigating forfeiture

of pay to detention of pay, the amount of the detention shall not be greater

than the amount of the forfeiture. When mitigating reduction in grade to

forfeiture or detention of pay, the amount of the forfeiture or detention

 shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially

under this article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.

(e) A person punished under this article who considers his punishment

unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel,

appeal to the next superior authority. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded

 and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to

undergo the punishment adjudged. The superior authority may exercise the

same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under

subsection (d) by the officer who imposed the punishment.Before acting on

an appeal from a punishment of - 

(1) arrest in quarters for more than seven days; 

(2) correctional custody for more than seven days; 

(3) forfeiture of more than seven days' pay; 

(4) reduction of one or more pay grades from the fourth or a higher

pay grade; 

(5) extra duties for more than 14 days; 

(6) restriction for more than 14 days; or 

(7) detention of more than 14 days' pay; 

the authority who is

to act on the appeal shall refer the case to a judge advocate or a lawyer

of the Department of Homeland Security for consideration and advice, and may

so refer the case upon appeal from any punishment imposed under subsection

(b). 

(f) The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under

this article for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial

for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission,

and not properly punishable under this article; but the fact that a disciplinary

punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused upon trial, and

when so shown shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment

to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty. 

(g) The Secretary concerned may, by regulation, prescribe the form

of records to be kept of proceedings under this article and may also prescribe

that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.

(2) special courts-martial, consisting of- 

(A) not less than three members; or

so requests; and 

(3) summary courts-martial, consisting of one commissioned officer.

## &sect; 817. Jurisdiction of courts-martial in general

subject to this chapter. The exercise of jurisdiction by one armed force

over personnel of another armed force shall be in accordance with regulations

 prescribed by the President. 

(b) In all cases, departmental review after that by the officer with

authority to convene a general court-martial for the command which held the

trial, where that review is required under this chapter, shall be carried

out by the department that includes the armed force of which the accused

is a member. 

## &sect; 818. Jurisdiction of general courts-martial

(a) Subject to section 817 of this title (article 17), general courts-martial have jurisdiction to try persons subject to this chapter for any offense made punishable by this chapter and may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this chapter, including the penalty of death when specifically authorized by this chapter. General courts-martial also have jurisdiction to try any person who by the law of war is  subject to trial by a military tribunal and may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war.

confinement for more than one year, hard labor without confinement for more

than three months, forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month,

and a military judge was detailed to the trial, except in any case in which

a military judge could not be detailed to the trial because of physical

conditions or military exigencies. In any such case in which a military judge

was not detailed to the trial, the convening authority shall make a detailed

written statement, to be appended to the record, stating the reason or reasons

 as the President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by

this chapter except death, dismissal, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge,

confinement for more than one month, hard labor without confinement for

more than 45 days, restriction to specified limits for more than two months,

the convening authority of a court-martial, military commission, or court

of inquiry shall detail or employ qualified court reporters, who shall record

 the proceedings of and testimony taken before that court or commission.

Under like regulations the convening authority of a court-martial, military

commission, or court of inquiry may detail or employ interpreters who shall

interpret for the court or commission. 

## &sect; 829. Absent and additional members

(a) No member of a general or special court-martial may be absent or

excused after the court has been assembled for the trial of the accused unless

excused as a result of a challenge, excused by the military judge for physical

 disability or other good cause, or excused by order of the convening authority

for good cause. 

(b) Whenever a general court-martial, other than a general court-martial

composed of a military judge only, is reduced below five members, the trial

may not proceed unless the convening authority details new members sufficient

in number to provide not less than five members. The trial may proceed with

composed of a military judge only, is reduced below three members, the trial

for both sides. 

(d) If the military judge of a court-martial composed of a military

judge only is unable to proceed with the trial because of physical disability,

subject to any applicable conditions of section 8 16(l)(B) or (2)(C) of this

title (article 16(1)(B) or (2)(C)), after the detail of a new military judge

as if no evidence had previously been introduced, unless a verbatim record

of the evidence previously introduced or a stipulation thereof is read in

court in the presence of the new military judge, the accused, and counsel

for both sides.

(A) Determining whether there is probable cause to believe an offense has been

committed and the accused committed the offense.

(B) Determining whether the convening authority has court-martial jurisdiction over the offense and the accused.

(C) Considering the form of charges.

(D) Recommending the disposition that should be made of the case.

(b) Hearing Officer.-

(1) A preliminary hearing under subsection (a) shall be conducted by an impartial

judge advocate certified under section 827(b) of this title (article 27(b)) whenever

practicable or, in exceptional circumstances in which the interests of justice warrant, by

an impartial hearing officer who is not a judge advocate. If the hearing officer is not a

judge advocate, a judge advocate certified under section 827(b) of this title (article

27(b)) shall be available to provide legal advice to the hearing officer.

(2) Whenever practicable, when the judge advocate or other hearing officer is

detailed to conduct the preliminary hearing, the officer shall be equal to or senior in

grade to military counsel detailed to represent the accused or the Government at the

preliminary hearing.

(c) Report of Results.-  After conducting a preliminary hearing under subsection (a),

the judge advocate or other officer conducting the preliminary hearing shall prepare a

report that addresses the matters specified in subsections (a)(2) and (f).

(d) Rights of Accused and Victim.-

(1) The accused shall be advised of the charges against the accused and of the accused's right to be represented by counsel at the preliminary hearing under subsection (a). The accused has the right to be represented at the preliminary hearing as provided in section 838 of this title (article 38) and in regulations prescribed under that section.

(e) Recording of Preliminary Hearing.-  A preliminary hearing under subsection (a) shall be recorded by a suitable recording device. The victim may request the recording and shall have access to the recording as prescribed by the Manual for Courts-Martial.

(f) Effect of Evidence of Uncharged Offense. If evidence adduced in a preliminary hearing under subsection (a) indicates that the accused committed an uncharged offense, the hearing officer may consider the subject matter of that offense without the accused having first been charged with the offense if the accused-

(1) is present at the preliminary hearing;

(2) is informed of the nature of each uncharged offense considered; and

(3) is afforded the opportunities for representation, cross-examination, and presentation consistent with subsection (d).

(g) Effect of Violation.-  The requirements of this section are binding on all persons administering this chapter, but failure to follow the requirements does not constitute jurisdictional error.

(h) Victim Defined.  In this section, the term "victim" means a person who-

(1) is alleged to have suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the matters set forth  in  a charge or specification being considered; and

(2) is named in one of the specifications.

## &sect; 833. Forwarding of charges

(a) Before directing the trial of any charge by general court-martial,

the convening authority shall refer it to his staff judge advocate for consideration

 and advice. The convening authority may not refer a specification under

a charge to a general court-martial for trial unless he has been advised

in writing by the staff judge advocate that- 

(1) the specification alleges an offense under this chapter; 

(2) the specification is warranted by the evidence indicated in the report of a preliminary hearing under section 832 of this title (article 32)(if there is such a report); and  

(3) a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the accused and the

offense. 

(b) The advice of the staff judge advocate under subsection (a) with

respect to a specification under a charge shall include a written and signed

statement by the staff judge advocate 

(1) expressing his conclusions with respect to each matter set forth

in subsection (a); and 

(2) recommending action that the convening authority take regarding

the specification. 

If the specification is referred for trial, the

recommendation of the staff judge advocate shall accompany the specification.

(c) If the charges or specifications are not formally correct or do

not conform to the substance of the evidence contained in the report of the

investigating officer, formal corrections, and such changes in the charges

 and specifications as are needed to make them conform to the evidence, may

be made. 

## &sect; 835. Service of charges

The trial counsel to whom court-martial charges are referred for

trial shall cause to be served upon the accused a copy of the charges upon

which trial is to be had. In time of peace no person may, against his objection,

(article 39(a)), in a general court-martial case within a period of five

days after the service of charges upon him or in a special court-martial

within a period of three days after the service of the charges upon him.

## &sect; 836. President may prescribe rules

(a) Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including modes of

proof, for cases arising under this chapter triable in courts-martial, military

commissions and other military tribunals, and procedures for courts of inquiry,

may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as

he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence

generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States

district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this

chapter. 

(b) All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform

insofar as practicable. 

## &sect; 837. Unlawfully influencing action of court

(a) No authority convening a general, special, or summary court-martial,

nor any other commanding officer, may censure, reprimand, or admonish the

court or any member, military judge, or counsel thereof, with respect to

the findings or sentence adjudged by the court, or with respect to any other

exercises of its or his functions in the conduct of the proceedings. No

person subject to this chapter may attempt to coerce or, by any unauthorized

means, influence the action of a court-martial or any other military tribunal

or any member thereof, in reaching the findings or sentence in any case,

or the action of any convening, approving, or reviewing authority with respect

to his judicial acts. The foregoing provisions of the subsection shall not

apply with respect to (1) general instructional or informational courses

in military justice if such courses are designed solely for the purpose of

instructing members of a command in the substantive and procedural aspects

of courts-martial, or (2) to statements and instructions given in open court

by the military judge, president of a special court-martial, or counsel.

(b) In the preparation of an effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency

report or any other report or document used in whole or in part for the purpose

of determining whether a member of the armed forces is qualified to be advanced,

in grade, or in determining the assignment or transfer of a member of the

armed forces or in determining whether a member of the armed forces should

be retained on active duty, no person subject to this chapter may, in preparing

any such report (1) consider or evaluate the performance of duty of any such

member of a court-martial, or (2) give a less favorable rating or evaluation

of any member of the armed forces because of the zeal with which such member,

as counsel, represented any accused before a court-martial. 

## &sect; 838. Duties of trial counsel and defense counsel

(a) The trial counsel of a general or special court-martial shall prosecute

in the name of the United States, and shall, under the direction of the court,

 prepare the record of the proceedings. 

(b)(1) The accused has the right to be represented in his defense before a general or special court-martial or at a preliminary hearing under section 832 of this title (article 32) as provided in this subsection. 

(2) The accused may be represented by civilian counsel if provided

by him. 

(3) The accused may be represented- 

(A) by military counsel detailed under section 827 of this title (article

27); or 

(B) by military counsel of his own selection if that counsel is reasonably

available (as determined under regulations prescribed under paragraph (7)).

(4) If the accused is represented by civilian counsel, military counsel

detailed or selected under paragraph (3) shall act as associate counsel unless

 excused at the request of the accused. 

(5) Except as provided under paragraph (6), if the accused is represented

by military counsel of his own selection under paragraph (3)(B), any military

 counsel detailed under paragraph (3)(A) shall be excused. 

(6) The accused is not entitled to be represented by more than one

military counsel. However, the person authorized under regulations prescribed

under section 827 of this title (article 27) to detail counsel in his sole

discretion- 

(A) may detail additional military counsel as assistant defense counsel;

and 

(B) if the accused is represented by military counsel of his own selection

under paragraph (3)(B), may approve a request from the accused that military

 counsel detailed under paragraph (3)(A) act as associate defense counsel.

(7) The Secretary concerned shall, by regulation, define "reasonably

available" for the purpose of paragraph (3)(B) and establish procedures

for determining whether the military counsel selected by an accused under

that paragraph is reasonably available. Such regulations may not prescribe

any limitation based on the reasonable availability of counsel solely on

the grounds that the counsel selected by the accused is from an armed force

other than the armed force of which the accused is a member. To the maximum

extent practicable, such regulations shall establish uniform policies among

the armed forces while recognizing the differences in the circumstances and

needs of the various armed forces. The Secretary concerned shall submit

copies of regulations prescribed under this paragraph to the Committees on

Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives. 

(c) In any court-martial proceeding resulting in a conviction, the

defense counsel- 

(1) may forward for attachment to the record of proceedings a brief

of such matters as he determines should be considered in behalf of the accused

on review (including any objection to the contents of the record which he

considers appropriate); 

(2) may assist the accused in the submission of any matter under section

860 of this title (article 60); and 

(3) may take other action authorized by this chapter. 

(d) An assistant trial counsel of a general court-martial may, under

the direction of the trial counsel or when he is qualified to be a trial

counsel as required by section 827 of this title (article 27), perform any

 duty imposed by law, regulation, or the custom of the service upon the trial

counsel of the court. An assistant trial counsel of a special court-martial

may perform any duty of the trial counsel. 

(e) An assistant defense counsel of a general or special court-martial

may, under the direction of the defense counsel or when he is qualified to

be the defense counsel as required by section 827 of this title (article

27), perform any duty imposed by law, regulation, or the custom of the service

upon counsel for the accused. 

## &sect; 839. Sessions

(a) At any time after the service of charges which have been referred

for trial to a court-martial composed of a military judge and members, the

military judge may, subject to section 835 of this title (article 35), call

the court into session without the presence of the members for the purpose

of- 

(1) hearing and determining motions raising defenses or objections

which are capable of determination without trial of the issues raised by

a plea of not guilty; 

(2) hearing and ruling upon any matter which may be ruled upon by the

military judge under this chapter, whether or not the matter is appropriate

for later consideration or decision by the members of the court; 

(3) if permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned, holding

the arraignment and receiving the pleas of the accused; and 

(4) performing any other procedural function which may be performed

by the military judge under this chapter or under rules prescribed pursuant

to section 836 of this title (article 36) and which does not require the

presence of the members of the court.

(b) Proceedings under subsection (a) shall be conducted

in the presence of the accused, the defense counsel, and the trial counsel

and shall be made a part of the record. These proceedings may be conducted

notwithstanding the number of members of the court and without regard to

section 829 of this title (article 29). If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, and if at least one defense counsel is physically in the presence of the accused, the presence required by this subsection may otherwise be established by audiovisual technology (such as videoteleconferencing technology). 

(c) When the members of a court-martial deliberate or vote, only the

members may be present. All other proceedings, including any other consultation

of the members of the court with counsel or the military judge, shall be

made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused, the

defense counsel, the trial counsel, and in cases in which a military judge

 has been detailed to the court, the military judge. 

(d) The findings, holdings, interpretations, and other precedents of military commissions under chapter 47A of this title-

(1) may not be introduced or considered in any hearing, trial, or other proceeding of a court-martial under this  chapter; and

(2) may not form the basis of any holding, decision, or other determination of a court-martial.

## &sect; 840. Continuances

The military judge or a court-martial without a military judge

may, for reasonable cause, grant a continuance to any party for such time,

and as often, as may appear to be just. 

## &sect; 841. Challenges

(a)(1) The military judge and members of a general or special court-martial

may be challenged by the accused or the trial counsel for cause stated to

the court. The military judge, or, if none, the court, shall determine the

relevance and validity of challenges for cause, and may not receive a challenge

to more than one person at a time. Challenges by the trial counsel shall

ordinarily be presented and decided before those by the accused are offered.

 (2) If exercise of a challenge for cause reduces the court below the

minimum number of members required by section 816 of this title (article

16), all parties shall (notwithstanding section 829 of this title (article

 29)) either exercise or waive any challenge for cause then apparent against

the remaining members of the court before additional members are detailed

to the court. However, peremptory challenges shall not be exercised at that

time. 

(b)(1) Each accused and the trial counsel are entitled initially to one

peremptory challenge of the members of the court. The military judge may

not be challenged except for cause. 

 (2) If exercise of a peremptory challenge reduces the court below the

minimum number of members required by section 816 of this title (article

16), the parties shall (notwithstanding section 829 of this title (article

 29)) either exercise or waive any remaining peremptory challenge (not previously

waived) against the remaining members of the court before additional members

are detailed to the court. 

(c) Whenever additional members are detailed to the court, and after

any challenges for cause against such additional members are presented and

decided, each accused and the trial counsel are entitled to one peremptory

challenge against members not previously subject to peremptory challenge. 

(As

amended Nov. 5, 1990, Pub. L. 101-510, Div. A, Title V, &sect; 541(b)-(d),

104 Stat. 1565.)

## &sect; 842. Oaths

(a) Before performing their respective duties, military judges, members

of general and special courts-martial, trial counsel, assistant trial counsel,

defense counsel, assistant or associate defense counsel, reporters, and

interpreters shall take an oath to perform their duties faithfully. The form

of the oath, the time and place of the taking thereof, the manner of recording

 the same, and whether the oath shall be taken for all cases in which these

duties are to be performed or for a particular case, shall be as prescribed

in regulations of the Secretary concerned. These regulations may provide

 that an oath to perform faithfully duties as a military judge, trial counsel,

assistant trial counsel, defense counsel, or assistant or associate defense

counsel may be taken at any time by any judge advocate or other person certified

to be qualified or competent for the duty, and if such an oath is taken it

need not again be taken at the time the judge advocate, or other person

is detailed to that duty. 

(b) Each witness before a court-martial shall be examined on oath.

## &sect; 843. Statute of limitations

and specifications by an officer exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction

over the command. 

(2)(A) A person charged with having committed a child abuse offense against

a child is liable to be tried by court-martial if the sworn charges and specifications

 are received during the life of the child or within five years after the date on which the offense was committed, whichever provides a longer period, by an officer exercising

 summary court-martial jurisdiction with respect to that person. 

(B) In subparagraph (A), the term "child abuse offense" means an act

(e) For an offense the trial of which in time of war is certified to

the President by the Secretary concerned to be detrimental to the prosecution

of the war or inimical to the national security, the period of limitation

prescribed in this article is extended to six months after the termination

of hostilities as proclaimed by the President or by a joint resolution of

Congress.

been fully completed. 

(c) A proceeding which, after the introduction of evidence but before

a finding, is dismissed or terminated by the convening authority or on motion

(a) If an accused after arraignment makes an irregular pleading, or

after a plea of guilty sets up matter inconsistent with the plea, or if it

appears that he has entered the plea of guilty improvidently or through

to plead, a plea of not guilty shall be entered in the record, and the court

shall proceed as though he had pleaded not guilty. 

(b) A plea of guilty by the accused may not be received to any charge

or specification alleging an offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged.

 With respect to any other charge or specification to which a plea of guilty

has been made by the accused and accepted by the military judge or by a court-martial

 without a military judge, a finding of guilty of the charge or specification

may, if permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned, be entered immediately

 without vote. This finding shall constitute the finding of the court unless

not guilty.

(3) In this subsection, the term "alleged sex-related offense" means any allegation of-

(A) a violation of section 920, 920a, 920b, 920c, or 925 of this title (article 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, or 125); or

have been legally subpoenaed to produce; 

is guilty of an offense against

the United States. 

(b) Any person who commits an offense named in subsection (a) shall

be tried on indictment or information in a United States district court or

in a court of original criminal jurisdiction in any of the

Commonwealths or possessions of the United States, and jurisdiction is conferred

upon those courts for that purpose. Upon conviction, such a person shall

 be fined or imprisoned, or both, at the court's discretion. 

(c) The United States attorney or the officer prosecuting for the United

States in any such court of original criminal jurisdiction shall, upon the

certification of the facts to him by the military court, commission, court

of inquiry, board, or convening authority file an information against and prosecute any person

violating this article. 

(d) The fees and mileage of witnesses shall be advanced or paid out

of the appropriations for the compensation of witnesses.

 (B) After referral of such charges for trial, by the convening authority or the military judge hearing the case.

(2) An authority authorized to order a deposition under paragraph (1) may order the deposition at the request of any party, but only if the party demonstrates that, due to exceptional circumstances, it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of the prospective witness be taken and preserved for use at a preliminary hearing under section 832 of this title (article 32) or a court-martial.

(3) If a deposition is to be taken before charges are referred for trial, the authority under paragraph (1)(A) may designate commissioned officers as counsel for the Government and counsel for the accused, and may authorize those officers to take the deposition of any witness.

(b) The party at whose instance a deposition is to be taken shall give

to every other party reasonable written notice of the time and place for

taking the deposition. 

(c) Depositions may be taken before and authenticated by any military

of the place where the deposition is taken to administer oaths. 

(d) A duly authenticated deposition taken upon reasonable notice to

the other parties, so far as otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence,

may be read in evidence or, in the case of audiotape, videotape, or similar

material, may be played in evidence before any military court or commission

in any case not capital, or in any proceeding before a court of inquiry or

military board, if it appears-

(1) that the witness resides or is beyond the State, Commonwealth,

or District of Columbia in which the court, commission, or board is ordered

 to sit, or beyond 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing; 

(2) that the witness by reason of death, age, sickness, bodily infirmity,

 cause, is unable or refuses to appear and testify in person at the place

of trial or hearing; or 

(3) that the present whereabouts of the witness is unknown. 

(e) Subject to subsection (d), testimony by deposition may be presented

by the defense in capital cases. 

(f) Subject to subsection (d), a deposition may be read in evidence

or, in the case of audiotape, videotape, or similar material, may be played

in evidence in any case in which the death penalty is authorized but is

not mandatory, whenever the convening authority directs that the case be

treated as not capital, and in such a case a sentence of death may not be

adjudged by the court-martial. 

## &sect; 850. Admissibility of records of courts of inquiry

(a) In any case not capital and not extending to the dismissal of a

commissioned officer, the sworn testimony, contained in the duly authenticated

record of proceedings of a court of inquiry, of a person whose oral testimony

cannot be obtained, may, if otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence,

be read in evidence by any party before a court-martial or military commission

if the accused was a party before the court of inquiry and if the same issue

was involved or if the accused consents to the introduction of such evidence.

(b) Such testimony may be read in evidence only by the defense in capital

cases or cases extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer. 

(c) Such testimony may also be read in evidence before a court of inquiry

or a military board. 

## &sect; 850a. Defense of lack of mental responsibility

(a) It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that,

at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused,

as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate

the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or

defect does not otherwise constitute a defense. 

(b) The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental

responsibility by clear and convincing evidence. 

(c) Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect

to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge, or the president

of a court-martial without a military judge, shall instruct the members

of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this

section and shall charge them to find the accused- 

(1) guilty; 

(2) not guilty; or 

(3) not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility. 

(d) Subsection (c) does not apply to a court-martial composed of a

military judge only. In the case of a court-martial composed of a military

judge only, whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect

 to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall find the accused-

(1) guilty; 

(2) not guilty; or 

(3) not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility. 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 852 of this title (article

52), the accused shall be found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental

responsibility if- 

(1) a majority of the members of the court-martial present at the time

the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility

has been established; or 

(2) in the case of court-martial composed of a military judge only,

the military judge determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility

has been established. 

## &sect; 851. Voting and rulings

(a) Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the

findings and on the sentence, and by members of a court-martial without a

military judge upon questions of challenge, shall be by secret written ballot.

The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be

checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result of the

ballot to the members of the court. 

(b) The military judge and, except for questions of challenge, the

president of a court-martial without a military judge shall rule upon all

questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings.

Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question of law or any

interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility

 of the accused, or by the president of a court-martial without a military

Judge upon any question of law other than a motion for a finding of not guilty,

is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military

judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge may change

his ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final, if

any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the

question decided by a voice vote as provided in section 852 of this title

(article 52), beginning with the junior in rank. 

(c) Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge or the

president of a court-martial without a military judge shall, in the presence

of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the

elements of the offense and charge them- 

(1) that the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt

is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;

(2) that in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt

as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the

accused and he must be acquitted; 

(3) that, if there is reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the

finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt;

and 

(4) that the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused

beyond reasonable doubt is upon the United States. 

(d) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) do not apply to a court-martial composed

of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court-martial shall

determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and,

if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military

judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall in addition

 on request find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision

is filed, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.

## &sect; 852. Number of votes required

(a)(1) No person may be convicted of an offense for which the death penalty

is made mandatory by law, except by the concurrence of all the members of

the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken. 

(2) No person may be convicted of any other offense, except as provided

in section 845(b) of this title (article 45(b)) or by the concurrence of

two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken. 

(b)(1) No person may be sentenced to suffer death, except by the concurrence

of all the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken

 and for an offense in this chapter expressly made punishable by death.

(2) No person may be sentenced to life imprisonment or to confinement

for more than ten years, except by the concurrence of three-fourths of the

members present at the time the vote is taken. 

(3) All other sentences shall be determined by the concurrence of two-thirds

of the members present at the time the vote is taken. 

(c) All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or

special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but a determination

to reconsider a finding of guilty or to reconsider a sentence, with a view

toward decreasing it, may be made by any lesser vote which indicates that

the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that

finding or sentence. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged.

A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating

to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused.

A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.

## &sect; 853. Court to announce action

A court-martial shall announce its findings and sentence to the

parties as soon as determined. 

## &sect; 854. Record of trial

(a) Each general court-martial shall keep a separate record of the

proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record shall be authenticated

by the signature of the military judge. If the record cannot be authenticated

 by the military judge by reason of his death, disability, or absence, it

shall be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel or by that of

a member if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate it by reason of

his death, disability, or absence. In a court-martial consisting of only

a military judge the record shall be authenticated by the court reporter

under the same conditions which would impose such a duty on a member under

the subsection. 

(b) Each special and summary court-martial shall keep a separate record

of the proceedings in each case, and the record shall be authenticated in

the manner required by such regulations as the President may prescribe.

(c)(1) A complete record of the proceedings and testimony shall be prepared-

(A) in each general court-martial case in which the sentence adjudged

includes death, a dismissal, a discharge, or (if the sentence adjudged does

not include a discharge) any other punishment which exceeds that which may

otherwise be adjudged by a special court-martial; and 

(B) in each special court-martial case in which the sentence adjudged

 includes a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or

 forfeiture of pay for more than six months. 

(2) In all other court-martial cases, the record shall contain such

matters as may be prescribed by regulations of the President. 

(d) A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special

court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.

(e) In the case of a general or special court-martial involving a sexual assault or other offense covered by section 920 of this title (article 120), a copy of all prepared records of the proceedings of the court-martial shall be given to the victim of the offense if the victim testified during the proceedings. The records of the proceedings shall be provided without charge and as soon as the records are authenticated. The victim shall be notified of the opportunity to receive the records of the proceedings.

be adjudged, a court-martial may adjudge a sentence of confinement for life

without eligibility for parole. 

(b) An accused who is sentenced to confinement for life without eligibility

for parole shall be confined for the remainder of the accused's life unless-

(1) the sentence is set aside or otherwise modified as a result of-

(A) action taken by the convening authority, the Secretary concerned,

or another person authorized to act under section 860 of this title (article

60); or

(B) any other action taken during post-trial procedure and review under

any other provision of subchapter IX; 

(2) the sentence is set aside or otherwise modified as a result of

action taken by a Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces, or the Supreme Court; or 

(3) the accused is pardoned.

## &sect; 857. Effective date of sentences

(1)  Any forfeiture of pay or allowances or reduction in grade that

is included in a sentence of a court-martial takes effect on the earlier

of-

(A) the date that is 14 days after the date on which the sentence is

adjudged; or

(B) the date on which the sentence is approved by the convening authority.

(2) On application by an accused, the convening authority may defer

a forfeiture of pay or allowances or reduction in grade that would otherwise

become effective under paragraph (1)(A) until the date on which the sentence

is approved by the convening authority. Such a deferment may be rescinded

at any time by the convening authority. 

(3) A forfeiture of pay and allowances shall be applicable to pay and

allowances accruing on and after the date on which the sentence takes effect.

(4) In this subsection, the term "convening authority ",

with respect to a sentence of a court-martial, means any person authorized

to act on the sentence under section 860 of this title (article 60). 

(b) Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial

begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial,

but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred

shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement. 

(c) All other sentences of courts-martial are effective on the date

ordered executed. 

## &sect; 857a. Deferment of sentences

(a) On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement

that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority or, if the accused

is no longer under his jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned,

may in his sole discretion defer service of the sentence to confinement.

 The deferment shall terminate when the sentence is ordered executed. The

deferment may be rescinded at any time by the officer who granted it or,

if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, by the officer exercising

general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused

is currently assigned. 

(1) In any case in which a court-martial sentences a person referred

to in paragraph (2) to confinement, the convening authority may defer the

service of the sentence to confinement, without the consent of that person,

until after the person has been permanently released to the armed forces

by a state or foreign country referred to in that paragraph. 

(2) Paragraph (1) applies to a person subject to this chapter who-

(A) While in the custody of a state or foreign country is temporarily

returned by that state or foreign country to the armed forces for trial by

court-martial; and 

(B) After the court-martial, is returned to that state or foreign country

under the authority of a mutual agreement or treaty, as the case may be.

(3) In this subsection, the term "state " means a state

of the United States, the District of Columbia, a territory, or a possession

of the United States. 

(c) In any case in which a court-martial sentences a person to confinement

and the sentence to confinement has been ordered executed, but in which review

of the case under section 867(a)(2) of this title (article 67(a)(2)) is

pending, the Secretary concerned may defer further service of sentence to

confinement while that review is pending. 

## &sect; 858. Execution of confinement

(a) Under such instructions as the Secretary concerned may prescribe,

a sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial or other military tribunal,

whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and whether

or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried into

execution by confinement in any place of confinement under the control of

any of the armed forces or in any penal or correctional institution under

the control of the United States, or which the United States may be allowed

to use. Persons so confined in a penal or correctional institution not under

the control of one of the armed forces are subject to the same discipline

and treatment as persons confined or committed by the courts of the United

States or of the State, District of Columbia, or place in which

the institution is situated. 

(b) The omission of the words "hard labor " from any sentence

of a court-martial adjudging confinement does not deprive the authority executing

 that sentence of the power to require hard labor as a part of the punishment.

## &sect; 858a. Sentences: reduction in enlisted grade upon approval

(a) Unless otherwise provided in regulations to be prescribed by the

Secretary concerned, a court-martial sentence of an enlisted member in a

pay grade above E-1, as approved by the convening authority, that

includes- 

(1) a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge; 

(2) confinement; or 

(3) hard labor without confinement; 

reduces that member to pay

grade E-1, effective on the date of that approval. 

(b) If the sentence of a member who is reduced in pay grade under subsection

(a) is set aside or disapproved, or, as finally approved, does not include

any punishment named in subsection (a)(l), (2), or (3), the rights and privileges

of which he was deprived because of that reduction shall be restored to him

and he is entitled to the pay and allowances to which he would have been

 entitled for the period the reduction was in effect, had he not been so

reduced. 

## &sect; 858b. Sentences: forfeiture of pay and allowances during confinement

(1) A court-martial sentence described in paragraph (2) shall result

in the forfeiture of pay, or of pay and allowances, due that member during

any period of confinement or parole. The forfeiture pursuant to this section

shall take effect on the date determined under section 857(a) of this title

(article 57(a)) and may be deferred as provided in that section. The pay

and allowances forfeited, in the case of a general court-martial, shall be

all pay and allowances due that member during such period and, in the case

of a special court-martial, shall be two-thirds of all pay due that member

during such period. 

(2) A sentence covered by this section is any sentence that includes-

(A) confinement for more than six months or death; or 

(B) confinement for six months or less and a dishonorable or bad-conduct

discharge or dismissal. 

(b) In a case involving an accused who has dependents, the convening

authority or other person acting under section 860 of this title (article

60) may waive any or all of the forfeitures of pay and allowances required

 by subsection (a) for a period not to exceed six months.  Any amount of

pay or allowances that, except for a waiver under this subsection, would

be forfeited shall be paid, as the convening authority or other person taking

action directs, to the dependents of the accused. 

(c) If the sentence of a member who forfeits pay and allowances under

subsection (a) is set aside or disapproved or, as finally approved, does

not provide for a punishment referred to in subsection (a)(2), the member

shall be paid the pay and allowances which the member would have been paid,

except for the forfeiture, for the period which the forfeiture was in effect.

on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially prejudices the

substantial rights of the accused. 

(b) Any reviewing authority with the power to approve or affirm a finding

of guilty may approve or affirm, instead, so much of the finding as includes

 a lesser included offense. 

## &sect; 860. Action by the convening authority

(a) The findings and sentence of a court-martial shall be reported

promptly to the convening authority after the announcement of the sentence.

(b)(1) The accused may submit to the convening authority matters for consideration

by the convening authority with respect to the findings and the sentence.

Any such submissions shall be in writing. Except in a summary court-martial

case, such a submission shall be made within 10 days after the accused has

been given an authenticated record of trial and, if applicable, the recommendation

of the staff judge advocate or legal officer under subsection (e). In a summary

court-martial case, such a submission shall be made within seven days after

the sentence is announced. 

(2) If the accused shows that additional time is required for the accused to submit such matters, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section, for good cause, may extend the applicable period under paragraph (1) for  not  more than  an additional 20 days. 

(3) In a summary court-martial case, the accused shall be promptly

provided a copy of the record of trial for use in preparing a submission

authorized by paragraph (1). 

(4) The accused may waive his right to make a submission to the convening

authority under paragraph (1). Such a waiver must be made in writing and

may not be revoked. For the purposes of subsection (c)(2), the time within

which the accused may make a submission under this subsection shall be deemed

to have expired upon the submission of such a waiver to the convening authority.

(5) The convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall not consider under this section any submitted matters that relate to the character of a victim unless such matters were presented as evidence at trial and not excluded at trial.

(c)(1) Under regulations of the Secretary concerned, a commissioned officer commanding for the time being, a successor in command, or any person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction may act under this section in place of the convening authority.

(2)(A) Action on the sentence of a court-martial shall be taken by the convening authority or by another person authorized to act under this section. Subject to regulations of the Secretary concerned, such action may be taken only after consideration of any matters submitted by the accused under subsection (b) or after the time for submitting such matters expires, whichever is earlier.

 (B) Except as provided in paragraph (4), the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section may approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend the sentence of the court-martial in whole or in part.

 (C) If the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section acts to disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, the sentence of the court-martial for an offense (other than a qualifying offense), the convening authority or other person shall provide, at that same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of the trial and action thereon.

(3)(A) Action on the findings of a court-martial by the convening authority or by another person authorized to act under this section is not required and may be taken only with respect to a qualifying offense. 

(B) If the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section acts on the findings of a court-martial, the convening authority or other person-

(i) may not dismiss any charge or specification by  setting aside a finding of guilty thereto, but may take such action with respect to a qualifying offense; or

(ii) may not change a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification, but may take such action with respect to a qualifying offense.

(C) If the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section acts on the findings to dismiss or change any charge or specification for an offense, the convening authority or other person shall provide, at that same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of the trial and action thereon.

(D)(i) In this subsection, the term "qualifying offense" means, except in the case of an offense excluded pursuant to clause (ii), an offense under this chapter for which-

  (I) the maximum sentence of confinement that may be adjudged does not exceed two years; and

  (II) the sentence adjudged does not include dismissal, a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or confinement for more than six months.

 (ii) Such term does not include any of the following:

  (I) An offense under subsection (a) or (b) of section 920 of this title (article 120).

  (II) An offense under section 920b or 925 of this title (articles 120b and 125).

  (III) Such other offenses as the Secretary of Defense may specify by regulation.

(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section may not disapprove, commute, or suspend in whole or in part an adjudged sentence of confinement for more than six months or a sentence of dismissal, dishonorable discharge, or bad conduct discharge.

(B) Upon the recommendation of the trial counsel, in recognition of the substantial assistance by the accused in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section shall have the authority to disapprove, commute, or suspend the adjudged sentence in whole or in part, even with respect to an offense for which a mandatory minimum sentence exists.

(C) If a pre-trial agreement has been entered into by the convening authority and the accused, as authorized by Rule for Courts-Martial 705, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section shall have the authority to approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend a sentence in whole or in part pursuant to the terms of the pre-trial agreement, subject to the following limitations for convictions of offenses that involve a mandatory minimum sentence:

(i) If a mandatory minimum sentence of a dishonorable discharge applies to an offense for which the accused has been convicted, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section may commute the dishonorable discharge to a bad conduct discharge pursuant to the terms of the pre-trial agreement.

(ii) Except as provided in clause (i), if a mandatory minimum sentence applies pursuant to section 856(b) of this title (article 56(b)) to an offense for which the accused has been convicted, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section may not disapprove, otherwise commute, or suspend the mandatory minimum sentence in whole or in part, unless authorized to do so under subparagraph (B).

(d)(1) In any case in which findings and sentence have been adjudged for an offense that involved a victim, the victim shall be provided an opportunity to submit matters for consideration by the convening authority or by another person authorized to act under this section before the convening authority or such other person takes action under this section.

(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the submission of matters under paragraph (1) shall be made within 10 days after the later of-

 (i) the date on which the victim has been given an authenticated record of trial in accordance with section 854(e) of this title (article 54(e)), if applicable; and

 (ii) the date on which the victim has been given the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer under subsection (e).

 (B) In the case of a summary court-martial, the submission of matters under paragraph (1) shall be made within seven days after the date on which the sentence is announced.

(3) If a victim shows that additional time is required for submission of matters under paragraph (1), the convening authority or other person taking action under this section, for good cause, may extend the submission period under paragraph (2) for not more than an additional 20 days.

(4) A victim may waive the right under this subsection to make a submission to the convening authority or other person taking action under this section. Such a waiver shall be made in writing and may not be revoked. For the purposes of subsection (c)(2), the time within which a victim may make a submission under this sub- section shall be deemed to have expired upon the submission of such waiver to the convening authority or such other person.

(5) In this section, the term "victim" means a person who has suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of a commission of an offense under this chapter (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) and on which the convening authority or other person authorized to take action under this section is taking action under this section.

(e) Before acting under this section on any general court-martial case or any special court-martial case that includes a bad-conduct discharge, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section shall obtain and consider the written recommendation of his staff judge advocate or legal officer. The convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall refer the record of trial to his staff judge advocate or legal officer, and the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall use such record in the preparation of his recommendation. The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall include such matters as the President may prescribe by regulation and shall be served on the accused, who may submit any matter in response under subsection (b). Failure to object in the response to the recommendation or to any matter attached to the recommendation waives the right to object thereto.

(f)(1) The convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section, may order a proceeding in revision or a rehearing.

(2) A proceeding in revision may be ordered if there is an apparent error or omission in the record or if the record shows improper or inconsistent action by a court-martial with respect to the findings or sentence that can be rectified without material prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused. In no case, however, may a proceeding in revision-

(A) reconsider a finding of not guilty of any specification or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not guilty;

(B) reconsider a finding of not guilty of any charge, unless there has been a finding of guilty under a specification laid under that charge, which sufficiently alleges a violation of some article of this chapter; or

(C) increase the severity of some article of the sentence unless the sentence prescribed  for the offense is mandatory.

(3) A rehearing may be ordered by the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section if he disapproves the findings and sentence and states the reasons for disapproval of the findings. If such person disapproves the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, he shall dismiss the charges. A rehearing as to the findings may not be ordered where there is a lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings. A rehearing as to the sentence may be ordered if the convening authority or other person taking action under this subsection disapproves the sentence.

## &sect; 861. Waiver or withdrawal of appeal

(a) In each case subject to appellate review under section 866 or 869(a)

of this title (article 66 or 69(a)), except a case in which the sentence

as approved under section 860(c) of this title (article 60(c)) includes

death, the accused may file with the convening authority a statement expressly

waiving the right of the accused to such review. Such a waiver shall be

signed by both the accused and by defense counsel and must be filed within

10 days after the action under section 860(c) of this title (article 60(c))

is served on the accused or on defense counsel. The convening authority

or other person taking such action, for good cause, may extend the period

for such filing by not more than 30 days. 

(b) Except in a case in which the sentence as approved under section

860(c) of this title (article 60(c)) includes death, the accused may withdraw

an appeal at any time. 

(c) A waiver of the right to appellate review or the withdrawal of

an appeal under this section bars review under section 866 or 869(a) of this

title (article 66 or 69(a)). 

## &sect; 862. Appeal by the United States

(1) In a trial by court-martial in which a military judge presides

and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States may

appeal the following (other than an order or ruling that is, or that amounts

 to, a finding of not guilty with respect to the charge or specification):

(A) An order or ruling of the military judge which terminates the proceedings

with respect to a charge or specification. 

(B)  An order or ruling which excludes evidence that is substantial

proof of a fact material in the proceeding. 

(C)  An order or ruling which directs the disclosure of classified

information. 

(D) An order or ruling which imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of

classified information. 

(E) A refusal of the military judge to issue a protective order sought

by the United States to prevent the disclosure of classified information.

(F) A refusal by the military judge to enforce an order described in

subparagraph (E) that has previously been issued by appropriate authority.

(2) An appeal of an order or ruling may not be taken unless the trial

counsel provides the military judge with written notice of appeal from the

order or ruling within 72 hours of the order or ruling. Such notice shall

include a certification by the trial counsel that the appeal is not taken

for the purpose of delay and (if the order or ruling appealed is one which

excludes evidence) that the evidence excluded is substantial proof of a

fact material in the proceeding. 

(3) An appeal under this section shall be diligently prosecuted by

appellate Government counsel. 

(b) An appeal under this section shall be forwarded by a means prescribed

under regulations of the President directly to the Court of Criminal Appeals

and shall, whenever practicable, have priority over all other proceedings

before that court. In ruling on an appeal under this section, the Court of

Criminal Appeals may act only with respect to matters of law, notwithstanding

 section 866(c) of this title (article 66(c)). 

(c) Any period of delay resulting from an appeal under this section

shall be excluded in deciding any issue regarding denial of a speedy trial

unless an appropriate authority determines that the appeal was filed solely

for the purpose of delay with the knowledge that it was totally frivolous

and without merit. 

## &sect; 863. Rehearings

Each rehearing under this chapter shall take place before a court-martial

composed of members not members of the court-martial which first heard the

 case. Upon a rehearing the accused may not be tried for any offense of which

he was found not guilty by the first court-martial, and no sentence in excess

 of or more severe than the original sentence may be approved, unless the

sentence is based upon a finding of guilty of an offense not considered upon

the merits in the original proceedings, or unless the sentence prescribed

for the offense is mandatory. If the sentence approved after the first court-martial

was in accordance with a pretrial agreement and the accused at the rehearing

 changes his plea with respect to the charges or specifications upon which

the pretrial agreement was based, or otherwise does not comply with the pretrial

agreement, the approved sentence as to those charges or specifications may

 include any punishment not in excess of that lawfully adjudged at the first

court-martial. 

## &sect; 864. Review by a judge advocate

(a) Each case in which there has been a finding of guilty that is not

reviewed under section 866 or 869(a) of this title (article 66 or 69(a))

shall be reviewed by a judge advocate under regulations of the Secretary

concerned. A judge advocate may not review a case under this subsection if

he has acted in the same case as an accuser, investigating officer, member

 of the court, military judge, or counsel or has otherwise acted on behalf

of the prosecution or defense. The judge advocate's review shall be in writing

and shall contain the following: 

(1) Conclusions as to whether- 

(A) the court had jurisdiction over the accused and the offense; 

(B) the charge and specification stated an offense; and 

(C) the sentence was within the limits prescribed as a matter of law.

(2) A response to each allegation of error made in writing by the accused.

(3) If the case is sent for action under subsection (b), a recommendation

as to the appropriate action to be taken and an opinion as to whether corrective

 action is required as a matter of law. 

(b) The record of trial and related documents in each case reviewed

under subsection (a) shall be sent for action to the person exercising general

court-martial jurisdiction over the accused at the time the court was convened

(or to that person's successor in command) if- 

(1) the judge advocate who reviewed the case recommends corrective

action; 

(2) the sentence approved under section 860(c) of this title (article

60(c)) extends to dismissal, a bad-conduct or dishonorable discharge, or

confinement for more than six months; or 

(3) such action is otherwise required by regulations of the Secretary

concerned. 

(c)(1) The person to whom the record of trial and related documents are

sent under subsection (b) may- 

(A) disapprove or approve the findings or sentence, in whole or in

part; 

(B) remit, commute, or suspend the sentence in whole or in part; 

(C) except where the evidence was insufficient at the trial to support

the findings, order a rehearing on the findings, on the sentence, or on both;

or 

(D) dismiss the charges. 

(2) If a rehearing is ordered but the convening authority finds a rehearing

impracticable, he shall dismiss the charges. 

(3) If the opinion of the judge advocate in the judge advocate's review

under subsection (a) is that corrective action is required as a matter of

law and if the person required to take action under subsection (b) does

not take action that is at least as favorable to the accused as that recommended

by the judge advocate, the record of trial and action thereon shall be sent

 to Judge Advocate General for review under section 869(b) of this title

(article 69(b)). 

## &sect; 865. Disposition of records

(a) In a case subject to appellate review under section 866 or 869(a)

of this title (article 66 or 69(a)) in which the right to such review is

not waived, or an appeal is not withdrawn, under section 861 of this title

(article 61), the record of trial and action thereon shall be transmitted

to the Judge Advocate General for appropriate action. 

(b) Except as otherwise required by this chapter, all other records

of trial and related documents shall be transmitted and disposed of as the

Secretary concerned may prescribe by regulation. 

## &sect; 866. Review by Court of Criminal Appeals

(a) Each Judge Advocate General shall establish a Court of Criminal

Appeals which shall be composed of one or more panels, and each such panel

shall be composed of not less than three appellate military judges. For

the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases, the court may sit in panels

or as a whole in accordance with rules prescribed under subsection (f).

Any decision of a panel may be reconsidered by the court sitting as a whole

in accordance with such rules. Appellate military judges who are assigned

to a Court of Criminal Appeals may be commissioned officers or civilians,

each of whom must be a member of a bar of a Federal court or the highest

court of a State. The Judge Advocate General shall designate as chief judge

 one of the appellate military judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals established

by him.

The chief judge shall determine on which panels of the court the

 appellate judges assigned to the court will serve and which military judge

assigned to the court will act as the senior judge on each panel. 

(b) The Judge Advocate General shall refer to a Court of Criminal Appeals

the record in each case of trial by court-martial- 

(1) in which the sentence, as approved, extends to death, dismissal

of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman, dishonorable or bad-conduct

discharge, or confinement for one year or more; and 

(2) except in the case of a sentence extending to death, the right

to appellate review has not been waived or an appeal has not been withdrawn

under section 861 of this title (article 61). 

(c) In a case referred to it, the Court of Criminal Appeals may act

only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening

authority. It may affirm only such findings of guilty and the sentence or

such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct in law and fact

and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved. In

considering the record, it may weigh the evidence, judge the credibility

 of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing

that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses. 

(d) If the Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside the findings and sentence,

it may, except where the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence

 in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. If it sets aside

the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, it shall order

that the charges be dismissed. 

(e) The Judge Advocate General shall, unless there is to be further

action by the President, the Secretary concerned, the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces, or the Supreme Court, instruct the convening authority

 to take action in accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal

Appeals. If the Court of Criminal Appeals has ordered a rehearing but the

convening authority finds a rehearing impracticable, he may dismiss the

charges. 

(f) The Judge Advocates General shall prescribe uniform rules of procedure

for Courts of Criminal Appeals and shall meet periodically to formulate policies

and procedure in regard to review of court-martial cases in the office of

the Judge Advocates General and by Courts of Criminal Appeals. 

(g) No member of a Court of Criminal Appeals shall be required, or

on his own initiative be permitted, to prepare, approve, disapprove, review,

or submit, with respect to any other member of the same or another Court

of Criminal Appeals, an effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency report, or

any other report documents used in whole or in part for the purpose of determining

 whether a member of the armed forces is qualified to be advanced in grade,

or in determining the assignment or transfer of a member of the armed forces,

or in determining whether a member of the armed forces shall be retained

on active duty. 

(h) No member of a Court of Criminal Appeals shall be eligible to review

the record of any trial if such member served as investigating officer in

the case or served as a member of the court-martial before which such trial

was conducted, or served as military judge, trial or defense counsel, or

reviewing officer of such trial. 

## &sect; 867. Review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

(a) The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces shall review the record

in- 

(1) all cases in which the sentence, as affirmed by a Court of Criminal

Appeals, extends to death; 

(2) all cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals which the Judge

Advocate General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

for review; and 

(3) all cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals in which, upon

petition of the accused and on good cause shown, the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces has granted a review. 

(b) The accused may petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

for review of a decision of a Court of Criminal Appeals within 60 days from

the earlier of- 

(1) the date on which the accused is notified of the decision of the

Court of Criminal Appeals; or 

(2) the date on which a copy of the decision of the Court of Criminal

Appeals, after being served on appellate counsel of record for the accused

(if any), is deposited in the United States mails for delivery by first

class certified mail to the accused at an address provided by the accused

or, if no such address has been provided by the accused, at the latest address

 listed for the accused in his official service record. The Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces shall act upon such a petition promptly in accordance

with the rules of the court. 

(c) In any case reviewed by it, the Court of Appeals for the Armed

Forces may act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved

by the convening authority and as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in

law by the Court of Criminal Appeals. In a case which the Judge Advocate

General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, that action

 need be taken only with respect to the issues raised by him. In a case reviewed

upon petition of the accused, that action need be taken only with respect

to issues specified in the grant of review. The Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces shall take action only with respect to matters of law. 

(d) If the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces sets aside the findings

and sentence, it may, except where the setting aside is based on lack of

sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing.

If it sets aside the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing,

it shall order that the charges be dismissed. 

(e) After it has acted on a case, the Court of Appeals for the Armed

Forces may direct the Judge Advocate General to return the record to the

Court of Criminal Appeals for further review in accordance with the decision

 of the court. Otherwise, unless there is to be further action by the President

or the Secretary concerned, the Judge Advocate General shall instruct the

convening authority to take action in accordance with that decision. If

the court has ordered a rehearing, but the convening authority finds a rehearing

impracticable, he may dismiss the charges. 

## &sect; 867a. Review by the Supreme Court

(a) Decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

are subject to review by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari as provided

in section 1259 of title 28. The Supreme Court may not review by a writ

of certiorari under this section any action of the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces in refusing to grant a petition for review. 

(b) The accused may petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari

without prepayment of fees and costs or security therefor and without filing

the affidavit required by section 1915(a) of title 28. 

## &sect; 868. Branch offices

The Secretary concerned may direct the Judge Advocate General to

establish a branch office with any command. The branch office shall be under

an Assistant Judge Advocate General who, with the consent of the Judge Advocate

General, may establish a Court of Criminal Appeals with one or more panels.

That Assistant Judge Advocate General and any Court of Criminal Appeals

established by him may perform for that command under the general supervision

of the Judge Advocate General, the respective duties which the Judge Advocate

General and a Court of Criminal Appeals established by the Judge Advocate

General would otherwise be required to perform as to all cases involving

sentences not requiring approval by the President. 

## &sect; 869. Review in the office of the Judge Advocate General

(a) The record of trial in each general court-martial that is not otherwise

reviewed under section 866 of this title (article 66) shall be examined in

the office of the Judge Advocate General if there is a finding of guilty

and the accused does not waive or withdraw his right to appellate review

under section 861 of this title (article 61). If any part of the findings

 or sentence is found to be unsupported in law or if reassessment of the

sentence is appropriate, the Judge Advocate General may modify or set aside

the findings or sentence or both. 

(b) The findings or sentence, or both, in a court-martial case not

reviewed under subsection (a) or under section 866 of this title (article

66) may be modified or set aside, in whole or in part, by the Judge Advocate

General on the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court,

lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to

the substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the sentence.

 If such a case is considered upon application of the accused, the application

must be filed in the office of the Judge Advocate General by the accused

on or before the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date the

sentence is approved under section 860(c) of this title (article 60(c)),

unless the accused establishes good cause for failure to file within that

 time. 

(c) If the Judge Advocate General sets aside the findings or sentence,

he may, except when the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence

in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. If he sets aside

the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, he shall order

that the charges be dismissed. If the Judge Advocate General orders a rehearing

but the convening authority finds a rehearing impractical, the convening

authority shall dismiss the charges. 

(d) A Court of Criminal Appeals may review, under section 866 of this

title (article 66)- 

(1) any court-martial case which (A) is subject to action by the Judge

Advocate General under this section, and (B) is sent to the Court of Criminal

Appeals by order of the Judge Advocate General; and, 

(2) any action taken by the Judge Advocate General under this section

in such case. 

(e) Notwithstanding section 866 of this title (article 66), in any

case reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals under this section, the Court

may take action only with respect to matters of law. 

## &sect; 870. Appellate counsel

(a) The Judge Advocate General shall detail in his office one or more

commissioned officers as appellate Government counsel, and one or more commissioned

officers as appellate defense counsel, who are qualified under section 827(b)(l)

of this title (article 27(b)(l)). 

(b) Appellate Government counsel shall represent the United States

before the Court of Criminal Appeals or the Court of Appeals for the Armed

Forces when directed to do so by the Judge Advocate General. Appellate Government

 counsel may represent the United States before the Supreme Court in cases

arising under this chapter when requested to do so by the Attorney General.

(c) Appellate defense counsel shall represent the accused before the

Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or

the Supreme Court- 

(1) when requested by the accused; 

(2) when the United States is represented by counsel; or 

(3) when the Judge Advocate General has sent the case to the Court

of Appeals for the Armed Forces. 

(d) The accused has the right to be represented before the Court of

Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or the Supreme

Court by civilian counsel if provided by him. 

(e) Military appellate counsel shall also perform such other functions

in connection with the review of court-martial cases as the Judge Advocate

General directs. 

## &sect; 871. Execution of sentence; suspension of sentence

(a) If the sentence of the court-martial extends to death, that part

of the sentence providing for death may not be executed until approved by

the President. In such a case, the President may commute, remit, or suspend

the sentence, or any part thereof, as he sees fit. That part of the sentence

providing for death may not be suspended. 

(b) If in the case of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman,

the sentence of a court-martial extends to dismissal, that part of the sentence

providing for dismissal may not be executed until approved by the Secretary

concerned or such Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary as may be designated

by the Secretary concerned. In such a case, the Secretary, Under Secretary

 or Assistant Secretary, as the case may be, may commute, remit, or suspend

the sentence, or any part of the sentence, as he sees fit. In time of war

or national emergency he may commute a sentence of dismissal to reduction

to any enlisted grade. A person so reduced may be required to serve for the

duration of the war or emergency and six months thereafter. 

(c)(1) If a sentence extends to death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or

bad-conduct discharge and if the right of the accused to appellate review

is not waived, and an appeal is not withdrawn, under section 861 of this

title (article 61), that part of the sentence extending to death, dismissal,

or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge may not be executed until there

 is a final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings (and with respect

to death or dismissal, approval under subsection (a) or (b), as appropriate).

A judgment as to legality of the proceedings is final in such cases when

review is completed by a Court of Criminal Appeals and- 

(A) the time for the accused to file a petition for review by the Court

of Appeals for the Armed Forces has expired and the accused has not filed

a timely petition for such review and the case is not otherwise under review

by that Court; 

(B) such a petition is rejected by the Court of Appeals for the Armed

Forces; or 

(C) review is completed in accordance with the judgment of the Court

of Appeals for the Armed Forces and- 

(i) a petition for a writ of certiorari is not filed within the time

limits prescribed by the Supreme Court; 

(ii) such a petition is rejected by the Supreme Court; or 

(iii) review is otherwise completed in accordance with the judgment of

the Supreme Court. 

(2) If a sentence extends to dismissal or a dishonorable or bad-conduct

discharge and if the right of the accused to appellate review is waived,

or an appeal is withdrawn, under section 861 of this title (article 61),

that part of the sentence extending to dismissal or a bad-conduct or dishonorable

discharge may not be executed until review of the case by a judge advocate

(and any action of that review) under section 864 of this title (article

 64) is completed. Any other part of a court-martial sentence may be ordered

executed by the convening authority or other person acting on the case under

section 860 of this title (article 60) when approved by him under that section.

(d) The convening authority or other person acting on the case under section 860 of this title (article 60) may suspend the execution of any sentence or part thereof, except a death sentence.  Paragraphs (2) and (4) of subsection (c) of section 860 of this title (article 60 shall apply to any decision by the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section to suspend the execution of any sentence or part thereof under this subsection.

## &sect; 872. Vacation of suspension

(a) Before the vacation of the suspension of a special court-martial

sentence which as approved includes a bad-conduct discharge, or of any general

court-martial sentence, the officer having special court-martial jurisdiction

over the probationer shall hold a hearing on the alleged violation of probation.

The probationer shall be represented at the hearing by counsel if he so

desires. 

(b) The record of the hearing and the recommendation of the officer

having special court-martial jurisdiction shall be sent for action to the

officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer.

 If he vacates the suspension, any unexecuted part of the sentence, except

a dismissal, shall be executed, subject to applicable restrictions in section

871(c) of this title (article 71(c)). The vacation of the suspension of

a dismissal is not effective until approved by the Secretary concerned.

(c) The suspension of any other sentence may be vacated by any authority

competent to convene, for the command in which the accused is serving or

assigned, a court of the kind that imposed the sentence. 

## &sect; 873. Petition for a new trial

At any time within two years after approval by the convening authority

of a court-martial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge Advocate

General for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence or fraud

on the court. If the accused's case is pending before a Court of Criminal

Appeals or before the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the Judge Advocate

General shall refer the petition to the appropriate court for action. Otherwise

the Judge Advocate General shall act upon the petition. 

## &sect; 874. Remission and suspension

(a) The Secretary concerned and, when designated by him, any Under

Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Judge Advocate General, or commanding officer

 may remit or suspend any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence,

 including all uncollected forfeitures other than a sentence approved by the

 President. However, in the case of a sentence of confinement for life without

 eligibility for parole, after the sentence is ordered executed, the authority

 of the Secretary concerned under the preceding sentence (1) may not be delegated,

and (2) may be exercised only after the service of a period of confinement

of not less than 20 years. 

(b) The Secretary concerned may, for good cause, substitute an administrative

form of discharge for a discharge or dismissal executed in accordance with

 the sentence of a court-martial. 

## &sect; 875. Restoration

(a) Under such regulations as the President may prescribe, all rights,

privileges, and property affected by an executed part of a court-martial

sentence which has been set aside or disapproved, except an executed dismissal

or discharge, shall be restored unless a new trial or rehearing is ordered

and such executed part is included in a sentence imposed upon the new trial

or rehearing. 

(b) If a previously executed sentence of dishonorable or bad-conduct

discharge is not imposed on a new trial, the Secretary concerned shall substitute

therefor a form of discharge authorized for administrative issuance unless

the accused is to serve out the remainder of this enlistment. 

(c) If a previously executed sentence of dismissal is not imposed on

a new trial, the Secretary concerned shall substitute therefor a form of

discharge authorized for administrative issue, and the commissioned officer

 dismissed by the sentence may be reappointed by the President alone to such

commissioned grade and with such rank as in the opinion of the President

that former officer would have attained had he not been dismissed. The reappointment

of such a former officer shall be without regard to the existence of a vacancy

and shall affect the promotion status of other officers only insofar as

the President may direct. All time between the dismissal and the reappointment

shall be considered as actual service for all purposes, including the right

 to pay and allowances. 

## &sect; 876. Finality of proceedings, findings, and sentences

The appellate review of records of trial provided by this chapter,

the proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed,

or affirmed as required by this chapter, and all dismissals and discharges

carried into execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval,

review, or affirmation as required by this chapter, are final and conclusive.

 Orders publishing the proceedings of courts-martial and all action taken

pursuant to those proceedings are binding upon all departments, courts, agencies,

 and officers of the United States, subject only to action upon a petition

for a new trial as provided in section 873 of this title (article 73) and

to action by the Secretary concerned as provided in section 874 of this

title (article 74), and the authority of the President. 

## &sect; 876a. Leave required to be taken pending review of certain court-martial

convictions

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an accused

who has been sentenced by a court-martial may be required to take leave pending

completion of action under this subchapter if the sentence, as approved

under section 860 of this title (article 60), includes an unsuspended dismissal

or an unsuspended dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge. The accused may

be required to begin such leave on the date on which the sentence is approved

under section 860 of this title (article 60) or at any time after such date,

and such leave may be continued until the date which action under this subchapter

is completed or may be terminated at any earlier time. 

## &sect; 876b. Lack of mental capacity or mental responsibility: commitment of accused

for examination and treatment

(a) Persons incompetent to stand trial-

(1) In the case of a person determined under this chapter to be presently

suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering the person mentally incompetent

 to the extent that the person is unable to understand the nature of the

proceedings against that person or to conduct or cooperate intelligently

in the defense of the case, the general court-martial convening authority

 for that person shall commit the person to the custody of the Attorney General.

(2) The Attorney General shall take action in accordance with section

4241(d) of title 18.

(3) If at the end of the period for hospitalization provided for in

section 4241(d) of title 18, it is determined that the committed person's

mental condition has not so improved as to permit the trial to proceed,

action shall be taken in accordance with section 4246 of such title.

(A) When the director of a facility in which a person is hospitalized

pursuant to paragraph (2) determines that the person has recovered to such

an extent that the person is able to understand the nature of the proceedings

against the person and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense

of the case, the director shall promptly transmit a notification of that

determination to the Attorney General and to the general court-martial convening

authority for the person. The director shall send a copy of the notification

to the person's counsel. 

(B) Upon receipt of a notification, the general court-martial convening

authority shall promptly take custody of the person unless the person covered

by the notification is no longer subject to this chapter.  If the person

is no longer subject to this chapter, the Attorney General shall take any

action within the authority of the Attorney General that the Attorney General

considers appropriate regarding the person. 

(C) The director of the facility may retain custody of the person for

not more than 30 days after transmitting the notifications required by subparagraph

(A).

(5) In the application of section 4246 of title 18 to a case under

this subsection, references to the court that ordered the commitment of a

person, and to the clerk of such court, shall be deemed to refer to the

general court-martial convening authority for that person. However, if the

person is no longer subject to this chapter at a time relevant to the application

 of such section to the person, the United States district court for the

district where the person is hospitalized or otherwise may be found shall

be considered as the court that ordered the commitment of the person.

(b) Persons found not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility-

(1) If a person is found by a court-martial not guilty only by reason

 of lack of mental responsibility, the person shall be committed to a suitable

facility until the person is eligible for release in accordance with this

section. 

(2) The court-martial shall conduct a hearing on the mental condition

in accordance with subsection (c) of section 4243 of title 18. Subsections

(b) and (d) of that section shall apply with respect to the hearing. 

(3) A report of the results of the hearing shall be made to the general

court-martial convening authority for the person. 

(4) If the court-martial fails to find by the standard specified in

subsection (d) of section 4243 of title 18 that the person's release would

not create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious

damage of property of another due to a present mental disease or defect-

(A) the general court-martial convening authority may commit the person

to the custody of the Attorney General; and 

(B) the Attorney General shall take action in accordance with subsection

(e) of section 4243 of title 18. 

(5) Subsections (f), (g), and (h) of section 4243 of title 18 shall

apply in the case of a person hospitalized pursuant to paragraph (4)(B),

except that the United States district court for the district where the person

 is hospitalized shall be considered as the court that ordered the person's

commitment. 

(c) General provisions-

## &sect; 942. Judges

### (a) Number.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces consists

of five judges. 

### (b) Appointment; qualification.

(1) Each judge of the court shall be appointed from civilian life by

the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a specified

term determined under paragraph (2). A judge may serve as a senior judge

as provided in subsection (e). 

(2) The term of a judge shall expire as follows: 

(A) In the case of a judge who is appointed after January 31 and before July 31 of any year, the term shall expire on July 31 of the year in which the fifteenth anniversary of the appointment occurs.

(3) Not more than three of the judges of the court may be appointed

from the same political party, and no person may be appointed to be a judge

of the court unless the person is a member of the bar of a Federal court

or the highest court of a State. 

(4) A person may not be appointed as a judge of the court within seven years after retirement from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force.

### (c) Removal.

Judges of the court may be removed from office by the President,

upon notice and hearing, for- 

(1) neglect of duty; 

(2) misconduct; or 

(3) mental or physical disability. 

A judge may not be removed

by the President for any other cause. 

### (d) Pay and allowances.

Each judge of the court is entitled to the same salary and travel

allowances as are, and from time to time may be, provided for judges of the

United States Court of Appeals. 

### (e) Senior judges.

(1)(A) A former judge of the court who is receiving retired pay or an

annuity under section 945 of this title (article 145) or under subchapter

III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5 shall be a senior judge. The

chief judge of the court may call upon an individual who is a senior judge

of the court under this subparagraph, with the consent of the senior judge,

to perform judicial duties with the court- 

(i) during a period a judge of the court is unable to perform his duties

because of illness or other disability; 

(ii) during a period in which a position of judge of the court is vacant;

or 

(iii) in any case in which a judge of the court recuses himself. 

(B) If, at the time the term of a judge expires, no successor to that

judge has been appointed, the chief judge of the court may call upon that

judge (with the judge's consent) to continue to perform judicial duties

with the court until the vacancy is filled. A judge who, upon the expiration

of the judge's term, continues to perform judicial duties with the court

 without a break in service under this subparagraph shall be a senior judge

while such service continues. 

(2) A senior judge shall be paid for each day on which he performs

judicial duties with the court an amount equal to the daily equivalent of

the annual rate of pay provided for a judge of the court. Such pay shall

be in lieu of retired pay and in lieu of an annuity under section 945 of

this title (Article 145), subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter II

of chapter 84 of title 5, or any other retirement system for employees of

the Federal Government. 

(3) A senior judge, while performing duties referred to in paragraph

(2), shall be provided with such office space and staff assistance as the

chief judge considers appropriate and shall be entitled to the per diem,

 travel allowances, and other allowances provided for judges of the court.

(4) A senior judge shall be considered to be an officer or employee

of the United States with respect to his status as a senior judge, but only

during periods the senior judge is performing duties referred to in paragraph

(2). For the purposes of section 205 of title 18, a senior judge shall be

considered to be a special Government employee during such periods. Any provision

 of law that prohibits or limits the political or business activities of

an employee of the United States shall apply to a senior judge only during

such periods. 

(5) The court shall prescribe rules for the use and conduct of senior

judges of the court. The chief judge of the court shall transmit such rules,

and any amendments to such rules, to the Committees on Armed Services of

the Senate and the House of Representatives not later than 15 days after

the issuance of such rules or amendments, as the case may be. 

(6) For purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 (relating

to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System) and chapter 84 of

such title (relating to the Federal Employees' Retirement System) and for

purposes of any other Federal Government retirement system for employees

of the Federal Government- 

(A) a period during which a senior judge performs duties referred to

in paragraph (1) shall not be considered creditable service; 

(B) no amount shall be withheld from the pay of a senior judge as a

retirement contribution under section 8334, 8343, 8422, or 8432 of title

5 or under other such retirement system for any period during which the

senior judge performs duties referred to in paragraph (1); 

(C) no contribution shall be made by the Federal Government to any

retirement system with respect to a senior judge for any period during which

the senior judge performs duties referred to in paragraph (1); and 

(D) a senior judge shall not be considered to be a reemployed annuitant

for any period during which the senior judge performs duties referred to

in paragraph (1). 

### (f) Service of article III judges.

(1) The Chief Justice of the United States, upon the request of the

chief judge of the court, may designate a judge of a United States Court

of Appeals or of a United States District Court to perform the duties of

judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces-

(A) during a period a judge of the court is unable to perform his duties

because of illness or other disability; or 

(B) in any case in which a judge of the court recuses himself; or

(C) during a period when there is a vacancy on the court and in the

opinion of the chief judge of the court such a designation is necessary for

the proper dispatch of the business of the court. 

(2) The chief judge of the court may not request that a designation

be made under paragraph (1) unless the chief judge has determined that no

person is available to perform judicial duties with the court as a senior

 judge under subsection (e). 

(3) A designation under paragraph (1) may be made only with the consent

of the designated judge and the concurrence of the chief judge of the court

of appeals or district court concerned. 

(4) Per diem, travel allowances, and other allowances paid to the designated

judge in connection with the performance of duties for the court shall be

paid from funds available for the payment of per diem and such allowances

for judges of the court. 

### (g) Effect of vacancy on court.

A vacancy on the court does not impair the right of the remaining

judges to exercise the powers of the court. 

## &sect; 943. Organization and employees

### (a) Chief judge.

(1)  The chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces shall be the judge of the court in regular active service who

is senior in commission among the judges of the court who-

(A)  have served for one or more years as judges of the court; and

(B)  have not previously served as chief judge.

(2)  In any case in which there is no judge of the court in regular

active service who has served as a judge of the court for at least one year,

the judge of the court in regular active service who is senior in commission

and has not served previously as chief judge shall act as the chief judge.

(3)  Except as provided in paragraph (4), a judge of the court shall

serve as the chief judge under paragraph (1) for a term of five years. If

no other judge is eligible under paragraph (1) to serve as chief judge upon

the expiration of that term, the chief judge shall continue to serve as chief

judge until another judge becomes eligible under that paragraph to serve

as chief judge.

(4)(A)  The term of a chief judge shall be terminated before the end of

five years if-

(i)  The chief judge leaves regular active service as a judge of the

court; or

(ii)  The chief judge notifies the other judges of the court in writing

that such judge desires to be relieved of his duties as chief judge.

(B)  The effective date of a termination of the term under subparagraph

(A) shall be the date on which the chief judge leaves regular active service

 or the date of the notification under subparagraph (A)(ii), as the case

may be.

(5)  If a chief judge is temporarily unable to perform his duties as

achief judge, the duties shall be performed by the judge of the court in

active service who is present, able, and qualified to act, and is next in

precedence.

### (b) Precedence of judges.

The chief judge of the court shall have precedence and preside

at any session that he attends. The other judges shall have precedence and

 whose commissions bear the same date shall have precedence according to

seniority in age. 

### (c) Status of Certain positions.

(1) Attorney positions of employment under the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces are excepted from the competitive service. A position of

employment under the court that is provided primarily for the service of

one judge of the court, reports directly to the judge, and is a position

of a confidential character is excepted from the competitive service. Appointments

 to positions referred to in the preceding sentences shall be made by the

court, without the concurrence of any other officer or employee of the executive

branch, in the same manner as appointments are made to other executive branch

positions of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it

is not practicable to examine or to hold a competitive examination. Such

positions shall not be counted as positions of that character for purposes

of any limitation on the number of positions of that character provided in

law. 

(2) In making appointments to the positions described in paragraph

(1), preference shall be given, among equally qualified persons, to persons

who are preference eligibles (as defined in section 2108(3) of title 5).

## &sect; 944. Procedure

The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may prescribe

its rules of procedure and may determine the number of judges required to

constitute a quorum. 

## &sect; 945. Annuities for judges and survivors

### (a) Retirement annuities for judges.

(1) A person who has completed a term of service for which he was appointed

as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is

eligible for an annuity under this section upon separation from civilian

service in the Federal Government. A person who continues service with the

court as a senior judge under section 943(e)(1)(B) of this title (art. 143(e)(1)(B))

 upon the expiration of the judge's term shall be considered to have been

separated from civilian service in the Federal Government only upon the termination

of that continuous service. 

(2) A person who is eligible for any annuity under this section shall

be paid that annuity if, at the time he becomes eligible to receive that

annuity, he elects to receive that annuity in lieu of any other annuity

for which he may be eligible at the time of such election (whether an immediate

or a deferred annuity) under subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter II

 of chapter 84 of title 5 or any other retirement system for civilian employees

of the Federal Government. Such an election may not be revoked. 

(3)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall notify the Director of the Office

of Personnel Management whenever an election under paragraph (2) is made

affecting any right or interest under subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter

11 of chapter 85 of title 5 based on service as a judge of the United States

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. 

(B) Upon receiving any notification under subparagraph (A) in the case

of a person making an election under (2), the Director shall determine the

amount of the person's lump-sum credit under subchapter 111 of chapter 83

or subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5, as applicable, and shall request

the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer such amount from the Civil Service

Retirement and Disability Fund to the Department of Defense Military Retirement

Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make any transfer so requested.

(C) In determining the amount of a lump-sum credit under section 8331(8)

of title 5 for purposes of this paragraph - 

(i) interest shall be computed using the rates under section 8334(e)(3)

of such title; and 

(ii) the completion of 5 years of civilian service (or longer) shall

not be a basis for excluding interest. 

### (b) Amount of annuity.

The annuity payable under this section to a person who makes an

election under subsection (a)(2) is 80 percent of the rate of pay for a judge

in active service on the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

as of the date on which the person is separated from civilian service. 

### (c) Relation to thrift savings plan.

Nothing in this section affects any right of any person to participate

in the thrift savings plan under section 8351 of title 5 of subchapter III

 of chapter 84 of such title. 

### (d) Survivor annuities.

The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe by regulation a program

to provide annuities for survivors and former spouses of persons receiving

annuities under this section by reason of elections made by such persons

 under subsection (a)(2). That program shall, to the maximum extent practicable,

provide benefits and establish terms and conditions that are similar to those

provided under survivor and former spouse annuity programs under other retirement

systems for civilian employees of the Federal Government. The program may

include provisions for the reduction in the annuity paid the person as a

condition for the survivor annuity. An election by a judge (including a senior

judge) or former judge to receive an annuity under this section terminates

 any right or interest which any other individual may have to a survivor

annuity under any other retirement system for civilian employees of the Federal

Government based on the service of that judge or former judge as a civilian

officer or employee of the Federal Government (except with respect to an

election under subsection (g)(1)(B)). 

### (e) Cost-of-living increases.

The Secretary of Defense shall periodically increase annuities

and survivor annuities paid under this section in order to take account of

changes in the cost of living. The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation

procedures for increases in annuities under this section. Such system shall,

to the maximum extent appropriate, provide cost-of-living adjustments that

 are similar to those that are provided under other retirement systems for

civilian employees of the Federal Government. 

### (f) Dual compensation.

A person who is receiving an annuity under this section by reason

of service as a judge of the court and who is appointed to a position in

the Federal Government shall, during the period of such person's service

in such position, be entitled to receive only the annuity under this section

or the pay for that position, whichever is higher. 

### (g) Election of judicial retirement benefits.

(1) A person who is receiving an annuity under this section by reason

of service as a judge of the court and who later is appointed as a justice

or judge of the United States to hold office during good behavior and who

retires from that office, or from regular active service in that office,

shall be paid either- 

(A) the annuity under this section, or 

(B) the annuity or salary to which he is entitled by reason of his

service as such a justice or judge of the United States, as determined by

an election by that person at the time of his retirement from the office,

or from regular active service in the office, of justice or judge of the

United States. Such an election may not be revoked. 

(2) An election by a person to be paid an annuity or salary pursuant

to paragraph (1)(B) terminates (A) any election previously made by such person

to provide a survivor annuity pursuant to subsection (d), and (B) any right

of any other individual to receive a survivor annuity pursuant to subsection

(d) on the basis of the service of that person. 

### (h) Source of payment of annuities.

Annuities and survivor annuities paid under this section shall

be paid out of the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund. 

### (i) Eligibility to elect between retirement systems.

(1)  This subsection applies with respect to any person who-

(A)  prior to being appointed as a judge of the United States Court

of Appeals for the Armed Forces, performed civilian service of a type making

such person subject to the Civil Service Retirement System; and

(B)  would be eligible to make an election under section 301(a)(2)

of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986, by virtue of being

appointed as such a judge, but for the fact that such person has not had

a break in service of a sufficient duration to be considered someone who

is being reemployed by the Federal Government.

(2)  Any person with respect to whom this subsection applies shall

be eligible to make an election under section 301(a)(2) of the Federal Employees'

Retirement System Act of 1986 to the same extent and in the same manner

(including subject to the condition set forth in section 301(d) of such Act)

as if such person's appointment constituted reemployment with the Federal

 Government.

to assume an important role in federal criminal investigations. To encourage

joint and coordinated investigative efforts, in appropriate cases where the

Department of Justice assumes investigative responsibility for a matter relating

to the Department of Defense, it should share information and conduct the

inquiry jointly with the interested Department of Defense investigative agency. 

 It

is neither feasible nor desirable to establish inflexible rules regarding

the responsibilities of the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice

as to each matter over which they may have concurrent interest. Informal

arrangements and agreements within the spirit of this MOU are permissible

with respect to specific crimes or investigations. 

## C. INVESTIGATIVE AND PROSECUTIVE JURISDICTION

### 1. CRIMES ARISING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OPERATIONS

#### a. Corruption Involving the Department of Defense Personnel

 The Department of Defense investigative agencies will refer

to the FBI on receipt all significant allegations of bribery and conflict

of interest involving military or civilian personnel of the Department of

Defense. In all corruption matters the subject of a referral to the FBI,

the Department of Defense shall obtain the concurrence of the Department

of Justice prosecutor or the FBI before initiating any independent investigation

preliminary to any action under the Uniform code of Military Justice. If

the Department of Defense is not satisfied with the initial determination,

the matter will be reviewed by the Criminal Division of the Department of

Justice. 

 The FBI will notify the referring agency promptly regarding

 whether they accept the referred matters for investigation. The FBI will

 attempt to make such decision in one (1) working day of receipt in such

matters. 

##### DoD Supplemental Guidance

A. Certain bribery and conflict of interest allegations (also referred

 to as "corruption" offenses in the MOU) are to be referred immediately

 to the FBI.

B. For the purposes of this section, bribery and conflict of interest

 allegations are those which would, if proven, violate 18 U.S.C., Sections

201, 203, 205, 208, 209, or 219 (reference (c)). 

C. Under paragraph C.1.a., DoD criminal investigative organizations

 shall refer to the FBI those "significant" allegations of bribery

 and conflict of interest that implicate directly military or civilian personnel

of the Department of Defense, including allegations of bribery or conflict

of interest that arise during the course of an ongoing investigation.

1. All bribery and conflict of interest allegations against present,

 retired, or former General or Flag officers and civilians in grade GS-16

and above, the Senior Executive Service and the Executive Level will be

considered "significant" for purposes of referral to the FBI.

2. In cases not covered by subsection C.1., above, the determination

of whether the matter is "significant" for purposes of referral

to the FBI should be made in light of the following factors: sensitivity

of the DoD program, involved, amount of money in the alleged bribe, number

of DoD personnel implicated, impact on the affected DoD program, and with

respect to military personnel, whether the matter normally would be handled

under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (reference (d)). Bribery and

conflicts of interest allegations warranting consideration of Federal prosecution,

which were not referred to the FBI based on the application of these guidelines

and not otherwise disposed of under reference (d), will be developed and

brought to the attention of the Department of Justice through the "conference"

 mechanism described in paragraph C.1.b. of the MOU(reference (b)).

D. Bribery and conflict of interest allegations when military or DoD

 civilian personnel are not subjects of the investigation are not covered

by the referral requirement of paragraph C.1.a of reference (b). Matters

in which the suspects are solely DoD contractors and their subcontractors,

such as commercial bribery between a DoD subcontractor and a DoD prime contractor,

do not require referral upon receipt to the FBI. The "conference"

procedure described in paragraph C.1.b. of reference (b) shall be used in

these types of cases.

E. Bribery and conflict of interest allegations that arise from events

 occurring outside the United States, its territories, and possessions, and

requiring investigation outside the United States, its territories, and

possessions need not be referred to the FBI.

#### b. Frauds Against the Department of Defense and Theft and Embezzlement

of Government Property

 The Department of Justice and the Department of Defense have

 investigative responsibility for frauds against the Department of Defense

and theft and embezzlement of Government property from the Department of

Defense. The Department of Defense will investigate frauds against the Department

of Defense and theft of government property from the Department of Defense.

Whenever a Department of Defense investigative agency identifies a matter

which, if developed by investigation, would warrant federal prosecution,

it will confer with the United States Attorney or the Criminal Division,

the Department of Justice, and the FBI field office. At the time of this

initial conference, criminal investigative responsibility will be determined

by the Department of Justice in consultation with the Department of Defense.

##### DoD Supplemental Guidance

A. Unlike paragraph C.1.a. of the MOU (reference (b)), paragraph C.1.b.

does not have an automatic referral requirement. Under paragraph C.1.b.,

DoD criminal investigative organizations shall confer with the appropriate

federal prosecutor and the FBI on matters which, if developed by investigation,

 would warrant Federal prosecution. This "conference" serves to

define the respective roles of DoD criminal investigative organizations and

the FBI on a case-by-case basis. Generally, when a conference is warranted,

the DoD criminal investigative organization shall arrange to meet with the

prosecutor and shall provide notice to the FBI that such meeting is being

held. Separate conferences with both the prosecutor and the FBI normally

are not necessary.

B. When investigations are brought to the attention of the Defense

Procurement Fraud Unit (DPFU), such contact will satisfy the "conference"

requirements of paragraph C.1.b. (reference (b)) as to both the prosecutor

and the FBI.

C. Mere receipt by DoD criminal investigative organizations of raw

allegations of fraud or theft does not require conferences with the DoJ and

the FBI. Sufficient evidence should be developed before the conference to

allow the prosecutor to make an informed judgment as to the merits of a case

dependent upon further investigation. However, DoD criminal investigative

organizations should avoid delay in scheduling such conferences, particularly

in complex fraud cases, because an early judgment by a prosecutor can be of

assistance in focusing the investigation on those matters that most likely

will result in criminal prosecution. 

### 2. CRIMES COMMITTED ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS

#### a. Subject(s) can be Tried by Court-Martial or are Unknown

 Crimes (other than those covered by paragraph C.1.) committed

on a military installation will be investigated by the Department of Defense

investigative agency concerned and, when committed by a person subject to

the Uniform Code of Military Justice, prosecuted by the Military Department

concerned. The Department of Defense will provide immediate notice to the

Department of Justice of significant cases in which an individual subject/victim

is other than a military member or dependent thereof. 

#### b. One or More Subjects cannot be Tried by Court-Martial

 When a crime (other than those covered by paragraph C.1.)

has occurred on a military installation and there is reasonable basis to

believe that it has been committed by a person or persons, some or all of

whom are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Department

of Defense investigative agency will provide immediate notice of the matter

to the appropriate Department of Justice investigative agency unless the Department

 of Justice has relieved the Department of Defense of the reporting requirement

for that type or class of crime. 

##### DoD Supplemental Guidance

A. Subsection C.2. of the MOU (reference (b)) addresses crimes committed

on a military installation other than those listed in paragraphs C.1.a. (bribery

and conflict of interest) and C.1.b. (fraud, theft, and embezzlement against

the Government).

B. Unlike paragraph C.1.a. of reference (b), which requires "referral"

to the FBI of certain cases, and paragraph C.1.b., which requires "conferences"

 with respect to certain cases, subsection C.2. requires only that "notice"

 be given to DoJ of certain cases. Relief from the reporting requirement

of subsection C.2. may be granted by the local U.S. attorney as to types or

classes of cases.

C. For purposes of paragraph C.2.a. (when the subjects can be tried

by court-martial or are unknown), an allegation is "significant"

for purposes of required notice to the DoJ only if the offense falls within

the prosecutorial guidelines of the local U.S. attorney. Notice should be

given in other cases when the DoD Component believes that Federal prosecution

is warranted or otherwise determines that the case may attract significant

public attention.

### 3. CRIMES COMMITTED OUTSIDE MILITARY INSTALLATIONS BY PERSONS WHO CAN

BE TRIED BY COURT-MARTIAL

#### a. Offense is Normally Tried by Court-Martial

 Crimes (other than those covered by paragraph C.1.) committed

outside a military installation by persons subject to the Uniform Code of

Military Justice which, normally, are tried by court-martial will be investigated

and prosecuted by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense will

provide immediate notice of significant cases to the appropriate Department

of Justice investigative agency. The Department of Defense will provide immediate

notice in all cases where one or more subjects is not under military jurisdiction

 unless the Department of Justice has relieved the Department of Defense of

the reporting requirement for that type or class of crime.

##### DoD Supplemental Guidance

 For purposes of this paragraph, an allegation is "significant"

for purposes of required notice to the DoJ only if the offense falls within

prosecutorial guidelines of the local U.S. attorney. Notice should be given

in other cases when the DoD Component believes that Federal prosecution is

warranted, or otherwise determines that the case may attract significant

public attention.

#### b. Crimes Related to Scheduled Military Activities

 Crimes related to scheduled Military activities outside of

a military installation, such as organized maneuvers in which persons subject

to the Uniform Code of Military Justice are suspects, shall be treated as

if committed on a military installation for purposes of this Memorandum.

The FBI or other Department of Justice investigative agency may assume jurisdiction

with the concurrence of the United States Attorney or the Criminal Division,

Department of Justice. 

#### c. Offense is not Normally Tried by Court-Martial

 When there are reasonable grounds to believe that a Federal

 crime (other than those covered by paragraph C.1.) normally not tried by

court-martial, has been committed outside a military installation by a person

 subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Department of Defense

 investigative agency will immediately refer the case to the appropriate

Department of Justice investigative agency unless the Department of Justice

 has relieved the Department of Defense of the reporting requirement for that

 type or class of crime. 

## D. REFERRALS AND INVESTIGATIVE ASSISTANCE

### 1. REFERRALS

 Referrals, notices, reports, requests and the general transfer

of information under this Memorandum normally should be between the FBI or

other Department of Justice investigative agency and the appropriate Department

of Defense investigative agency at the field level. 

 If a Department

of Justice investigative agency does not accept a referred matter and the

referring Department of Defense investigative agency then, or subsequently,

believes that evidence exists supporting prosecution before civilian courts,

the Department of Defense agency may present the case to the United States

Attorney or the Criminal Division, Department of Justice, for review. 

### 2. INVESTIGATIVE ASSISTANCE

 In cases where a Department of Defense or Department of Justice

investigative agency has primary responsibility and it requires limited assistance

to pursue outstanding leads, the investigative agency requiring assistance

will promptly advise the appropriate investigative agency in the other Department

and, to the extent authorized by law and regulations, the requested assistance

should be provided without assuming responsibility for the investigation.

## E. PROSECUTION OF CASES

1. With the concurrence of the Department of Defense, the Department

of Justice will designate such Department of Defense attorneys as it deems

desirable to be Special Assistant United States Attorneys for use where the

effective prosecution of cases may be facilitated by the Department of Defense

attorneys. 

2. The Department of Justice will institute civil actions expeditiously

in United States District Courts whenever appropriate to recover monies lost

as a result of crimes against the Department of Defense; the Department

of Defense will provide appropriate assistance to facilitate such actions.

3. The Department of Justice prosecutors will solicit the views of

the Department of Defense prior to initiating action against an individual

subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 

4. The Department of Justice will solicit the views of the Department

of Defense with regard to its Department of Defense-related cases and investigations

in order to effectively coordinate the use of civil, criminal and administrative

remedies.

#### DoD Supplemental Guidance

**Prosecution of Cases and Grants of Immunity**

A. The authority of court-martial convening authorities to refer cases

to trial, approve pretrial agreements, and issue grants of immunity under

the UCMJ (reference (d)) extends only to trials by court-martial. In order

to ensure that such actions do not preclude appropriate action by Federal

civilian authorities in cases likely to be prosecuted in the U.S. district

courts, court-martial convening authorities shall ensure that appropriate

consultation as required by this enclosure has taken place before trial by

court-martial, approval of a pretrial agreement, or issuance of a grant of

immunity in cases when such consultation is required.

B. Only a general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity

under the UCMJ (reference (d)), and may do so only in accordance with R.C.M.

704 (reference (e)).

1. Under reference (d), there are two types of immunity in the military

justice system:

a. A person may be granted transactional immunity from trial by court-martial

for one or more offenses under reference (d). 

b. A person may be granted testimonial immunity, which is immunity

from the use of testimony, statements, and any information directly or indirectly

derived from such testimony or statements by that person in a later court-martial.

2. Before a grant of immunity under reference (d), the general court-martial

convening authority shall ensure that there has been appropriate consultation

with the DoJ with respect to offenses in which consultation is required by

this enclosure. 

3. A proposed grant of immunity in a case involving espionage, subversion,

aiding the enemy, sabotage, spying, or violation of rules or statutes concerning

classified information or the foreign relations of the United States shall

be forwarded to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense for the purpose

of consultation with the DoJ. The General Counsel shall obtain the views

of other appropriate elements of the Department of Defense in furtherance

of such consultation. 

C. The authority of court-martial convening authorities extends only

to grants of immunity from action under reference (d). Only the Attorney

General or other authority designated under 18 U.S.C. Secs. 6001-6005 (reference

(c)) may authorize action to obtain a grant of immunity with respect to trials

in the U.S. district courts. 

## F. MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

### 1. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

 Nothing in this Memorandum limits the Department of Defense

investigations conducted in support of administrative actions to be taken

by the Department of Defense. However, the Department of Defense investigative

 agencies will coordinate all such investigations with the appropriate Department

of Justice prosecutive agency and obtain the concurrence of the Department

of Justice prosecutor or the Department of Justice investigative agency prior

to conducting any administrative investigation during the pendency of the

criminal investigation or prosecution. 

### 2. SPECIAL UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE FACTORS

 In situations where an individual subject to the Uniform Code

of Military Justice is a suspect in any crime for which a Department of Justice

investigative agency has assumed jurisdiction, if a Department of Defense

investigative agency believes that the crime involves special factors relating

to the administration and discipline of the Armed Forces that would justify

its investigation, the Department of Defense investigative agency will advise

the appropriate Department of Justice investigative agency or the Department

of Justice prosecuting authorities of these factors. Investigation of such

a crime may be undertaken by the appropriate Department of Defense investigative

agency with the concurrence of the Department of Justice. 

### 3. ORGANIZED CRIME

 The Department of Defense investigative agencies will provide

to the FBI all information collected during the normal course of agency operations

pertaining to the element generally known as "organized crime "

including both traditional (La Cosa Nostra) and nontraditional organizations

whether or not the matter is considered prosecutable. The FBI should be notified

of any investigation involving any element of organized crime and may assume

jurisdiction of the same. 

### 4. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NOTIFICATIONS TO DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INVESTIGATIVE

AGENCIES

a. The Department of Justice investigative agencies will promptly notify

the appropriate Department of Defense investigative agency of the initiation

of the Department of Defense related investigations which are predicated

on other than a Department of Defense referral except in those rare instances

where notification might endanger agents or adversely affect the investigation.

The Department of Justice investigative agencies will also notify the Department

of Defense of all allegations of the Department of Defense related crime where

investigation is not initiated by the Department of Justice. 

b. Upon request, the Department of Justice investigative agencies will

provide timely status reports on all investigations relating to the Department

of Defense unless the circumstances indicate such reporting would be inappropriate.

c. The Department of Justice investigative agencies will promptly furnish

investigative results at the conclusion of an investigation and advise as

to the nature of judicial action, if any, taken or contemplated. 

d. If judicial or administrative action is being considered by the

Department of Defense, the Department of Justice will, upon written request,

provide existing detailed investigative data and documents (less any federal

grand jury material, disclosure of which would be prohibited by Rule 6(e),

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure), as well as agent testimony for use

in judicial or administrative proceedings, consistent with Department of

Justice and other federal regulations. The ultimate use of the information

shall be subject to the concurrence of the federal prosecutor during the

pendency of any related investigation or prosecution. 

### 5. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

a. The Department of Justice will provide to the Department of Defense

 all technical services normally available to federal investigative agencies.

b. The Department of Defense will provide assistance to the Department

of Justice in matters not relating to the Department of Defense as permitted

by law and implementing regulations. 

### 6. JOINT INVESTIGATIONS

a. To the extent authorized by law, the Department of Justice investigative

agencies and the Department of Defense investigative agencies may agree to

enter into joint investigative endeavors, including undercover operations,

in appropriate circumstances. However, all such investigations will be subject

 to Department of Justice guidelines. 

b. The Department of Defense, in the conduct of any investigation that

might lead to prosecution in Federal District Court, will conduct the investigation

consistent with any Department of Justice guidelines. The Department of Justice

shall provide copies of all relevant guidelines and their revisions. 

##### DoD Supplemental Guidance

 When DoD procedures concerning apprehension, search and seizure,

interrogation, eyewitnesses, or identification differ from those of DoJ,

DoD procedures will be used, unless the DoJ prosecutor has directed that

DoJ procedures be used instead. DoD criminal investigators should bring to

the attention of the DoJ prosecutor, as appropriate, situations when use

of DoJ procedures might impede or preclude prosecution under the UCMJ (reference

(d)). 

### 7. APPREHENSION OF SUSPECTS

 To the extent authorized by law, the Department of Justice

and the Department of Defense will each promptly deliver or make available

to the other suspects, accused individuals and witnesses where authority to

 investigate the crimes involved is lodged in the other Department. This MOU

neither expands nor limits the authority of either Department to perform

apprehensions, searches, seizures, or custodial interrogations. 

## G. EXCEPTION

 This Memorandum shall not affect the investigative authority

now fixed by the 1979 "Agreement Governing the Conduct of the Defense

Department Counter intelligence Activities in Conjunction with the Federal

Bureau of Investigation" and the 1983 Memorandum of Understanding between

the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice and the FBI concerning

"Use of Federal Military Force in Domestic Terrorist Incidents."

# MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS OF JUSTICE AND

 TRANSPORTATION (COAST GUARD) RELATING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTION

OF CRIMES OVER WHICH THE TWO DEPARTMENTS HAVE CONCURRENT JURISDICTION.

Whereas, certain crimes committed by Coast Guard personnel subject

to the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be prosecuted by Coast Guard

tribunals under the Code or by civilian authorities in the Federal Courts;

and 

 Whereas, it is recognized that although the administration

and discipline of the Coast Guard requires that certain types of crimes committed

by its personnel be investigated by that service and prosecuted before Coast

Guard military tribunals other types of crimes committed by such military

personnel should be investigated by civil authorities and prosecuted before

civil tribunals; and 

 Whereas, it is recognized that it is not

feasible to impose inflexible rules to determine the respective responsibility

of the civilian and Coast Guard military authorities as to each crime over

which they may have concurrent jurisdiction and that informal arrangements

and agreements may be necessary with respect to specific crimes or investigations;

and 

 Whereas, agreement between the Department of Justice and the

Department of Transportation (Coast Guard) as to the general areas in which

they will investigate and prosecute crimes to which both civil and military

 jurisdiction attach will, nevertheless, tend to make the investigation and

prosecution of crimes more expeditious and efficient and give appropriate

effect to the policies of civil government and the requirements of the United

 States Coast Guard; 

 It is hereby agreed and understood between

the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation (Coast Guard)

as follows: 

## 1. Crimes committed on military installations (including aircraft and

vessels). 

Except as hereinafter indicated, all crimes committed on a military

installation by Coast Guard personnel subject to the Uniform Code of Military

Justice shall be investigated and prosecuted by the Coast Guard if the Coast

Guard makes a determination that there is a reasonable likelihood that only

Coast Guard personnel subject to the Uniform Code of Military justice are

involved in such crimes as principles or accessories, and except in extraordinary

cases, that there is no victim other than persons who are subject to the Uniform

 Code of Military Justice or who are bona fide dependents or members of a

household of military or civilian personnel residing on the installation.

Unless such a determination is made, the Coast Guard shall promptly advise

the Federal Bureau of Investigation of any crime committed on a military

installation if such crime is within the investigative authority of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation shall investigate

any serious crime of which it has been so advised for the purpose of prosecution

in the civil courts unless the Department of Justice determines that investigation

and prosecution may be conducted more efficiently and expeditiously by the

Coast Guard. Even if the determination provided for in the first sentence

of this paragraph is made by the Coast Guard, it shall promptly advise the

Federal Bureau of Investigation of any crime committed on a military installation

in which there is a victim who is not subject to the Uniform Code of Military

Justice or a bona fide dependent or member of the household of military or

civilian personnel residing on the installation and that the Coast Guard

is investigating the crime because it has been determined to be extraordinary.

The Coast Guard shall promptly advise the Federal Bureau of Investigation

whenever the crime, except in minor offenses, involves fraud against the

government, misappropriation, robbery, or theft of government property of

funds, or is of a similar nature. All such crimes shall be investigated by

the Coast Guard unless it receives prompt advise that the Department of Justice

has determined that the crime should be investigated by the Federal Bureau

of Investigation and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation will undertake

the investigation for the purpose of prosecution in the civil courts. 

## 2. Crimes committed outside of military installations.

Except as hereinafter indicated, all crimes committed outside of

military installations, which fall within the investigative jurisdiction

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and in which there is involved as

a suspect an individual subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, shall

be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of

prosecution in civil courts, unless the Department of Justice determines

that investigation and prosecution may be conducted more efficiently and expeditiously

by other authorities. All such crimes which come first to the attention of

Coast Guard authorities shall be referred promptly by them to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, unless relieved of this requirement by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation as to particular types or classes of crime. However,

whenever Coast Guard military personnel are engaged in scheduled military

activities outside of military installations such as organized maneuvers

or organized movement, the provisions of paragraph 1 above shall apply, unless

persons not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice are involved

as principals, accessories or victims. 

 If, however, there is involved

as a suspect or as an accused in any crime committed outside of a military

installation and falling within the investigative authority of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, an individual who is subject to the Uniform Code

of Military Justice and if the Coast Guard authorities believe that the crime

involves special factors relating to the administration and discipline of

the Coast Guard which would justify investigation by them for the purpose

of prosecution before a Coast Guard military tribunal, they shall promptly

advise the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the crime and indicate their

views on the matter. Investigation of such a crime may be undertaken by the

Coast Guard military authorities if the Department of Justice agrees. 

## 3. Transfer of investigative authority. 

An investigative body of the Coast Guard which has initiated an

 investigation pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof, shall have exclusive

investigative authority and may proceed therewith to prosecution. If, however,

any Coast Guard investigative body comes to the view that effectuation of

those paragraphs requires the transfer of investigative authority over a

crime, investigation of which has already been initiated by that or by any

other investigative body, it shall promptly advise the other interested investigative

body of its views. By agreement between the Departments of Justice and Transportation

 (Coast ~Guard),~ investigative authority may then be transferred. 

## 4. Administrative action.

Exercise of exclusive investigative authority by the Federal Bureau

of Investigation pursuant to this agreement shall not preclude Coast Guard

military authorities from making inquiries for the purpose of administrative

action related to the crime being investigated. The Federal Bureau of Investigation

will make the results of its investigations available to Coast Guard military

authorities for use in connection with such action. 

 Whenever possible,

decisions with respect to the application in particular cases of the provisions

of this Memorandum of Understanding will be made at the local level, that

is, between the Special Agent in Charge of the local office of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation and the local Coast Guard military commander. 

## 5. Surrender of suspects.

To the extent of the legal authority conferred upon them, the Department

of Justice and Coast Guard military authorities will each deliver to the

other promptly suspects and accused individuals if authority to investigate

the crimes in which such accused individuals and suspects are involved is

lodged in the other by paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof. 

 Nothing in

this memorandum shall prevent the Coast Guard from prompt arrest and detention

of any person subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice whenever there

is knowledge or reasonable basis to believe that such a person has committed

an offense in violation of such code and detaining such person until he is

delivered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation if such action is required

pursuant to this memorandum.

Introduction

MJ:

 , your plea of guilty will not be accepted

unless you understand its meaning and effect. I am going to discuss your

plea of guilty with you now. If you have any questions, please say so. Do

you understand?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

A plea of guilty is the strongest form of proof known to the law.

On your plea alone, without receiving any evidence, this court-martial could

find you guilty of the offense(s) to which you are pleading guilty. Your

plea will not be accepted unless you understand that by pleading guilty you

admit every element of each offense and you are pleading guilty because you

really are guilty. If you do not believe that you are guilty, you should

not plead guilty for any reason. You have the right to plead not guilty

and place the burden upon the prosecution to prove your guilt. Do you understand

that?

ACC:

 .

Waiver of rights

MJ:

By your plea of guilty you waive, or in other words, you give up

 certain important rights. (You give up these rights only as to the offense(s)

 to which you have pleaded guilty. You keep them as to the offense(s) to which

 you have pleaded not guilty). The rights you give up are: First, the right

 against self-incrimination, that is the right to say nothing at all about

 (this) (these) offense(s). Second, the right to a trial of the facts by the

 court-martial, that is, the right to have this court-martial decide whether

or not you are guilty based on evidence presented by the prosecution and,

if you chose to do so, by the defense. Third, the right to be confronted

by the witnesses against you, that is to see and hear the witnesses against

you here in the court-martial and to have them cross-examined, and to call

witnesses in your behalf. Do you understand these rights?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

If you plead guilty, there will not be a trial of any kind as to

the offense(s) to which you are pleading guilty, so by pleading guilty you

give up the rights I have just described. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

Maximum penalty

MJ:

Defense counsel, what advice have you given  

as to the maximum punishment for the offense(s) to which the accused pleaded

 guilty?

DC:

 .

MJ:

Trial counsel, do you agree with that?

TC:

 .

[Note 28. If there is a question as to the maximum

 punishment, the military judge must resolve it. If the maximum punishment

may be subject to further dispute, the military judge should advise the accused

of the alternative possibilities and determine whether this affects the accused's

 decision to plead guilty.]

MJ:

 , by your plea of guilty this court-martial

could sentence you to the maximum authorized punishment, which is. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Do you feel you have had enough time to discuss your case with your

 counsel, ?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

 , do you feel that you have had enough

time to discuss the case with your client?

DC:

 .

MJ:

 , are you satisfied with  (and ), your defense counsel, and do you

believe (his) (her) (their) advice has been in your best interest?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Are you pleading guilty voluntarily?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Has anyone tried to force you to plead guilty?

ACC:

 .

Factual basis for plea

[Note 29. The accused will be placed under oath

at this point. _See_ R.C.M. 910(e). The military judge may

inquire whether there is a stipulation in connection with the plea, and may

inquire into the stipulation at this point. _See_ R.C.M.

811.]

MJ:

In a moment, you will be placed under oath and we will discuss the

 facts of your case. If what you say is not true, your statements may be used

 against you in a prosecution for perjury or false statement. Do you understand?

ACC:

 .

TC:

Do you (swear) (affirm) that the statements you are about to make

 shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you

 God)?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

I am going to explain the elements of the offense(s) to which you

 have entered pleas of guilty. By "elements" I mean the facts

which the Government would have to prove by evidence beyond a reasonable

doubt before you could be found guilty if you pleaded not guilty. When I

state each of these elements ask yourself if it is true, and whether you

want to admit that its true. Then be ready to talk about these facts with

me.

MJ:

Please look at your copy of the charges and specifications. You

have pleaded guilty to Charge , Specification 

, a violation of Article  

of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The elements of that offense are

 .

[Note 30. _See_ subparagraph b of

the appropriate paragraph in Part IV. The description of the elements should

be tailored to the allegations in the specification. Legal terms should be

 explained.]

MJ:

Do you understand those elements?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Do the elements correctly describe what you did?

ACC:

 .

Accused's description of

 offense(s)

[Note 3l. The military judge should elicit from

the accused facts supporting the guilty plea by questioning the accused about

the offense(s). The questioning should develop the accused's description

of the offense(s) and establish the existence of each element of the offense(s).

The military judge should be alert to discrepancies in the accused's description

or between the accused's description and any stipulation. If the accused's

 discussion or other information discloses a possible defense, the military

 judge must inquire into the matter, and may not accept the plea if a possible

 defense exists. The military judge should explain to the accused the elements

 of a defense when the accused's description raises the possibility of one.

The foregoing inquiry should be repeated as to each offense to which the

accused has pleaded guilty.]

Identification of accused

MJ:

Do you admit that you are,  the accused

 in this case?

ACC:

 .

Jurisdiction

MJ:

On (date of earliest offense), were you

a member of the United States (Army) (Navy) (Air Force) (Marine Corps) (Coast

 Guard) on active duty, and have you remained on active duty since then?

ACC:

 .

[Note 32. The military judge should determine whether

 jurisdiction might be affected by a post-offense reenlistment.]

Pretrial agreement

MJ:

Is there a pretrial agreement in this case?

TC or DC:

 .

[Note 33. If the answer is yes proceed to note

35; if the answer is no, proceed as follows.]

MJ:

  are you pleading guilty because of any

promise by the Government that you will receive a sentence reduction or other

benefit from the Government if you plead guilty?

ACC:

.

[Note 34. If the answer is no, proceed to acceptance

of the plea. If the answer is yes, the military judge should determine from

the accused and counsel whether any agreement exists. If so, the plea agreement

inquiry should continue. If not, then the military judge should clarify any

misunderstanding the accused may have, and ascertain whether the accused

still wants to plead guilty. Once any issue is resolved, if the accused maintains

the plea of guilty, proceed to acceptance of the plea.]

[Note 35. If there is a pretrial agreement, the

military judge must: (l) ensure that the entire agreement is presented, provided

that in trial by military judge alone the military judge ordinarily will

not examine any sentence limitation at this point; (2) ensure that the agreement

complies with R.C.M. 705; and (3) inquire to ensure that the accused understands

the agreement and that the parties agree to it. _See_ R.C.M.

910(f). If the agreement contains any ambiguous or unclear terms, the military

judge should obtain clarification from the parties.]

[Note 36. The agreement should be marked as an

Appellate Exhibit. If the agreement contains a sentence limitation and trial

is before military judge alone, the sentence limitation should be marked

as a separate Appellate Exhibit, if possible.]

[Note 37. The language below is generally appropriate

when trial is before military judge alone. It should be modified when trial

is before members.]

MJ:

 , I have here Appellate Exhibit , which is part of a pretrial agreement between you and , the convening authority. Is this your signature which appears

(on the bottom of page ), ()

and did you read this part of the agreement?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Did you also read and sign Appellate Exhibit ,

which is the second part of the agreement?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Do you believe that you fully understand the agreement?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

I don't know, and I don't want to know at this time the sentence

 limitation you have agreed to. However, I want you to read that part of the

 agreement over to yourself once again.

MJ:

[After accused has done so.] Without saying what

it is, do you understand the maximum punishment the convening authority may

approve?

ACC:

.

MJ:

In a pretrial agreement, you agree to enter a plea of guilty to

(some of) the charge(s) and specification(s), and, in return, the convening

authority agrees to (approve no sentence greater than that listed in Appellate

Exhibit , which you have just read) ( ). [In addition, (you have agreed to testify against) () (the convening authority has

agreed to withdraw Charge and its specification)

(). Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

If the sentence adjudged by this court-martial is greater than the

 one provided in the agreement, the convening authority would have to reduce

the sentence to one no more severe than the one in your agreement. On the

other hand, if the sentence adjudged by this court-martial is less than the

one in your agreement, the convening authority cannot increase the sentence

adjudged. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

[Note 38. The military judge should discuss the

 agreement with the accused, and explain any terms which the accused may

not understand. If the accused does not understand a term, or if the parties

disagree as to a term, the agreement should not be accepted unless the matter

is clarified to the satisfaction of the parties. If there are any illegal

terms, the agreement must be modified in accordance with R.C.M. 705. The

trial counsel should be granted a recess on request to secure the assent

of the convening authority to any material modification in the agreement.]

MJ:

  is this agreement, Appellate Exhibit(s) 

  (and ) the entire agreement between

you and the convening authority? In other words, is it correct that there

are no other agreements or promises in this case?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Do counsel agree?

TC:

 .

DC:

 .

MJ:

 , do you understand your pretrial agreement?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Do counsel disagree with my explanation or interpretation of the

 agreement in any respect?

TC:

 .

DC:

 .

MJ:

(To DC), did the offer to make a pretrial agreement originate with

the defense?

DC:

 .

MJ:

  are you entering this agreement freely

and voluntarily?

AC:

 .

MJ:

Has anyone tried to force you to enter this agreement?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Have you fully discussed this agreement with your counsel, and are

 you satisfied that (his) (her) advice is in your best interest?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

 , although you believe you are guilty,

you have a legal and a moral right to plead not guilty and to require the

Government to prove its case against you, if it can, by legal and competent

evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. If you were to plead not guilty, then

you would be presumed under the law to be not guilty, and only by introducing

evidence and proving your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can the Government

overcome that presumption. Do you understand?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

Do you have any questions about your plea of guilty, your pretrial

 agreement, or anything we have discussed?

ACC:

 .

Acceptance of guilty plea

MJ:

Do you still want to plead guilty?

ACC:

 .

MJ:

I find that the accused has knowingly, intelligently, and consciously

 waived (his) (her) rights against self-incrimination, to a trial of the facts

 by a court-martial, and to be confronted by the witnesses against (him)

(her); that the accused is, in fact guilty; and (his) (her) plea of guilty

 is accepted.

MJ:

 , you may request to withdraw your plea

of guilty any time before the sentence is announced in your case and if you

have a good reason for your request, I will grant it. Do you understand?

ACC:

 .

Announcement of findings based on a guilty plea

[Note 39. Findings of guilty may, and ordinarily

should, be entered at this point _except_ when: (l) not permitted

by regulations of the Secretary concerned; or (2) the plea is to a lesser

included offense and the prosecution intends to proceed to trial on the offense

as charged. _See_ R.C.M. 9l0(g)(l) and (2). _See also

_ R.C.M. 9l0(g)(3) in special courts-martial without a military judge.

In trials before military judge alone, when some offenses are to be contested,

the military judge may elect to defer entry of any findings until the end

of trial on the merits.]

[Note 40. _See_ R.C.M. 922 and Appendix

 10 concerning forms of findings.]

MJ:

 , in accordance with your plea(s) of guilty,

this court-martial finds you (of all charges and specifications) (of Specification

  of Charge  and Charge ): Guilty.

[Note 41. If trial is before members, and no offenses

 remain to be contested on the merits, this may be an appropriate point for

the military judge to inform the accused of the rights to allocution under

R.C.M. 100l(a)(3). _See_ Note 88 below. In addition, other

issues relating to the information or evidence to be introduced on sentencing

should ordinarily be resolved at this point. If other offenses remain to

be contested, the military judge should consider, and solicit the views of

the parties, whether to inform the members only of the offenses to which

the accused pleaded not guilty. The copy of the charges presented to the

members should reflect this decision. _See also_ Note 26.]

# Section II. Trial With Members; Preliminary Session

[Note 42. The following procedure is suggested

for a trial with members after completion of the Article 39(a) session.

 Before calling the court-martial to order, the military judge

should examine the convening order and any amending orders and ensure that

all members required to be present are present. Witnesses should be excluded

from the courtroom except when they testify. 

 When the court-martial

is ready to proceed the military judge should direct the bailiff, if any,

or the trial counsel to call the members. Whenever the members enter the

courtroom, all persons present except the military judge and reporter should

rise. 

 The members are seated alternatively to the right and left

of the president according to rank.]

TC:

If any member is aware of any matter which may be a ground for

challenge by any party, the member should so state.

[Note 47. In case of a negative response, trial

counsel should announce "Apparently not."]

[Note 48. The military judge and, if permitted

by the military judge, counsel may examine the members on voir dire. _

See_ R.C.M. 912(d) and Discussion. The parties may present evidence

relating to challenges for cause. _See_ R.C.M. 912(e). Upon

completion of voir dire and taking evidence, if any, the parties will be

called upon to enter challenges for cause. Ordinarily trial counsel enters

challenges for cause before defense counsel. After any challenges for cause,

the parties may be called upon to enter peremptory challenges. Ordinarily

trial counsel enters a peremptory challenge before the defense. The parties

must be permitted to enter challenges outside the presence of members. _

See_ R.C.M. 912(f) and (g). In special courts-martial without a

military judge, _see_ R.C.M. 912(h).]

[Note 49. If any members are successfully challenged,

 they should be excused in open session in the presence of the parties. The

record should indicate that they withdrew from the courtroom. The members

who remain after challenges should be reseated according to rank, as necessary.]

[Note 50. The military judge should ensure that

a quorum remains, and, if the court-martial is composed with enlisted persons,

that at least one-third of the remaining members are enlisted persons. _

See_ R.C.M. 912(g)(2) Discussion.]

[Note 51. If the members have not yet been informed

of the plea(s), this should now be done.]

MJ:

Members of the court-martial, at an earlier session the accused

was arraigned and entered the following pleas:  .

[Note 52. In a special court-martial without a

military judge, the accused should now be arraigned. _See_ Notes

22-39.]

[Note 53. If the military judge entered findings

based on pleas of guilty and no offenses remain to be contested, the military

judge should give the following instruction and proceed to SECTION IV, below.]

MJ:

I accepted the accused's pleas of guilty and entered findings of

 guilty as to (the) (all) Charge(s) () and Specification(s)

 () and ). Therefore,

we will now proceed to determine a sentence in the case.

[Note 54. If the accused pleaded guilty to some

 offenses, but others remain to be contested, and the members have been informed

of the offenses to which the accused pleaded guilty, the military judge should

 instruct as follows.]

MJ:

Members, you will not be required to reach findings regarding Charge

 () and Specification(s) ()

 (and ) (and ). Findings

will be required, however, as to Charge () and Specification(s)

() (and ) (and ), to which the accused has pleaded not guilty. You may

not consider the fact that the accused pleaded guilty to (one) (some) offense(s)

in any way in deciding whether the accused is guilty of the offense(s) to

which (he) (she) has pleaded not guilty.

[Note 55. If the accused has pleaded guilty to

a lesser included offense and the prosecution intends to prove the greater

offense, the military judge should instruct as follows.]

MJ:

The accused's plea of guilty to the lesser included offense of  admits some of the elements of the offense charged in

(the) Specification () of (the) Charge (). These elements are, therefore, established by the accused's

plea without need of further proof. However, the accused's plea of guilty

to this lesser included offense provides no basis for a finding of guilty

as charged, because there still remains in issue the elements of . No inference of guilt of such remaining elements may be drawn

from the accused's plea. Before the accused may be found guilty of the offense

 charged, the prosecution must prove the remaining element(s) beyond a reasonable

doubt.

# GUIDE FOR SUMMARY COURTS-MARTIAL

[General Note to SCM: It is not the purpose of this guide to

answer all questions which may arise during a trial. When this guide, chapter

13 of the Rules for Courts-Martial, and other legal materials available fail

 to provide sufficient information concerning law or procedure, the summary

 court-martial should seek advice on these matters from a judge advocate. _

See_ R.C.M. 1301(b). If the accused has obtained, or wishes to obtain,

defense counsel, _see_ R.C.M. 1301(e). The SCM should examine

the format for record of trial at appendix 15. It may be useful as a checklist

during the proceedings to ensure proper preparation after trial. The SCM

should become familiar with this guide before using it. Instructions for

the SCM are contained in brackets, and should not be read aloud. Language

in parentheses reflects optional or alternative language. The SCM should

read the appropriate language aloud.]

Preliminary Proceeding

Identity of SCM

SCM:

I am . I have been detailed to conduct a

 summary court-martial (by Summary Court-Martial Convening Order (Number), Headquarters, , dated [

 _see_convening order]).

Referral of charges to trial

Charges against you have been referred to me for trial by summary

 court-martial by ([_name and title of convening authority

_]) on ([_date of referral_])

[_see_ block IV on page 2 of charge sheet].

[Note 1. Hand copy of charge sheet to the accused.]

Providing the accused with charge sheet

I suggest that you keep this copy of the charge sheet and refer

to it during the trial. The charges are signed by [ _see

_ first name at top of page 2 of charge sheet], a person

 subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as accuser, and are properly

sworn to before a commissioned officer of the armed forces authorized to

administer oaths. ( ordered the charges to be preferred.)

The charges allege, in general, violation of Article,

in that you  (and Article,

in that you ). I am now going to tell you about certain

rights you have in this trial. You should carefully consider each explanation

 because you will soon have to decide whether to object to trial by summary

court-martial. Until I have completed my explanation, do not say anything

except to answer the specific questions which I ask you. Do you understand

that?

ACC:

 .

Duties of SCM

SCM:

As summary court-martial it is my duty to obtain and examine all

the evidence concerning any offense(s) to which you plead not guilty, and

to thoroughly and impartially inquire into both sides of the matter. I will

call witnesses for the prosecution and question them, and I will help you

in cross-examining those witnesses. I will help you obtain evidence and present

 the defense. This means that one of my duties is to help you present your

side of the case. You may also represent yourself, and if you do, it is my

 duty to help you. You are presumed to be innocent until your guilt has been

 proved by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. If you

are found guilty of an offense, it is also my duty to consider matters which

might affect the sentence, and then to adjudge an appropriate sentence. Do

you understand that?

ACC:

 .

Right to object to SCM

SCM:

You have the absolute right to object to trial by summary court-martial.

 If you object the appropriate authority will decide how to dispose of the

 case. The charges may be referred to a special or general court-martial,

or they may be dismissed, or the offenses charged may be disposed of by

(nonjudicial punishment [if not previously offered and refused]

or) administrative measures.[ _See_ R.C.M. 306.]

Do you understand that?

ACC:

.

Right to inspect allied papers and personnel records.

SCM:

You may inspect the allied papers and personnel records [Hand

those documents which are available to the accused for examination in your

presence.] (You may also inspect [_identify personnel

records or other documents which are not present_] which

are located at . You may have time to examine these

if you wish.)

Witnesses/other evidence for the government

SCM:

The following witnesses will probably appear and testify against

you: . The following documents and physical evidence

will probably be introduced: .

Right to cross-examine

After these witnesses have testified in response to my questions,

you may cross-examine them. If you prefer, I will do this for you after you

inform me of the matters about which you want the witness to be questioned.

Do you understand that?

ACC:

.

Right to present evidence

SCM:

You also have the right to call witnesses and present other evidence.

 This evidence may concern any or all of the charges. (I have arranged to

have the following witnesses for you present at the trial.) I will arrange

for the attendance of other witnesses and the production of other evidence

 requested by you. I will help you in any way possible. Do you understand

 that?

ACC:

 .

Evidence to be considered

SCM:

In deciding this case, I will consider only evidence introduced

during the trial. I will not consider any other information, including any

statements you have made to me, which is not introduced in accordance with

the Military Rules of Evidence during the court-martial. Do you understand

that? 

ACC:

 .

Right to remain silent

SCM:

You have the absolute right during this trial to choose not to

testify and to say nothing at all about the offense(s) with which you are

charged. If you do not testify, I will not hold it against you in any way.

I will not consider it as an admission that you are guilty. If you remain

silent, I am not permitted to question you about the offense(s).

Right to testify concerning the offense(s)

However, if you choose, you may be sworn and testify as a witness

 concerning the offense(s) charged against you. If you do that, I will consider

your testimony just like the testimony of any other witness.

[Note 2. Use the following if there is only one

 specification.]

If one specification

If you decide to testify concerning the offense, you can be questioned

by me about the whole subject of the offense. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

[Note 3. Use the following if there is more than

one specification.]

If more than one specification

SCM:

If you decide to testify, you may limit your testimony to any particular

offense charged against you and not testify concerning any other offense(s)

charged against you. If you do this, I may question you about the whole subject

of the offense about which you testify, but I may not question you about

any offense(s) concerning which you do not testify. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

Right to testify, remain silent or make an unsworn statement

in extenuation and mitigation

SCM:

In addition, if you are found guilty of an offense, you will have

the right to testify under oath concerning matters regarding an appropriate

 sentence. You may, however, remain silent, and I will not hold your silence

 against you in any way. You may, if you wish, make an unsworn statement about

 such matters. This statement may be oral, in writing, or both. If you testify,

 I may cross-examine you. If you make an unsworn statement, however, I am

not permitted to question you about it, but I may receive evidence to contradict

 anything contained in the statement. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

Maximum punishment

SCM:

If I find you guilty (of the offense) (of any of the offenses charged),

the maximum sentence which I am authorized to impose is:

[Note 4. For an accused of a pay grade of E-4

or below, proceed as follows.]

E-4 and below

 

reduction to lowest enlisted pay grade; and

forfeiture of two-thirds of 1 month's pay; and

confinement for l month.

 

[Note 5. For an accused of a pay grade above E-4,

 proceed as follows.]

E-5 and above

 

reduction to the next inferior pay grade; and

forfeiture of two-thirds of 1 month's pay; and

restriction to specified limits for 2 months.

 

SCM:

Do you understand the maximum punishment which this court-martial

is authorized to adjudge?

ACC:

 .

Plea options

SCM:

You may plead not guilty or guilty to each offense with which you

are charged. You have an absolute right to plead not guilty and to require

that your guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before you can be found

guilty. You have the right to plead not guilty even if you believe you are

guilty. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

If you believe you are guilty of an offense, you may, but are not

 required to, plead guilty to that offense. If you plead guilty to an offense,

 you are admitting that you committed that offense, and this court-martial

could find you guilty of that offense without hearing any evidence, and could

sentence you to the maximum penalty I explained to you before. Do you understand

that?

ACC:

 .

Lesser included offenses

SCM:

[Examine the list of lesser included offenses under each

 punitive article alleged to have been violated. _See_ Part

IV. If a lesser included offense may be in issue, give the following advice.]

 You may plead not guilty to Charge , Specification

 , as it now reads, but plead guilty to the offense

of , which is included in the offense charged. Of

course, you are not required to do this. If you do, then I can find you guilty

of this lesser offense without hearing evidence on it. Furthermore, I could

still hear evidence on the greater offense for purposes of deciding whether

you are guilty of it. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

Do you need more time to consider whether to object to trial by

 summary court-martial or to prepare for trial?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

[If time is requested or otherwise appropriate.]

We will convene the court-martial at . When we convene,

I will ask you whether you object to trial by summary court-martial. If you

do not object, I will then ask for your pleas to the charge(s) and specification(s),

 and for you to make any motions you may have.

How do you plead? Before you answer that question, if you have any

 motion to dismiss (the) (any) charge or specification, or for other relief,

you should make it now.

ACC:

 .

Motions

[Note 7. If the accused makes a motion to dismiss

or to grant other relief, or such a motion is raised by the summary court-martial,

do not proceed with the trial until the motions have been decided. _

 See_ R.C.M. 905-907, and R.C.M. l304(b)(2)(c). After any motions

 have been disposed of and if termination of the trial has not resulted, have

 the accused enter pleas and proceed as indicated below.]

Pleas

ACC:

I plead: .

[Note 8. If the accused refuses to plead to any

offense charged, enter pleas of not guilty. If the accused refuses to enter

any plea, evidence must be presented to establish that the accused is the

person named in the specification(s) and is subject to court-martial jurisdiction. _

 See_ R.C.M. 202, 1301(c)]

[Note 9. If the accused pleads not guilty to all

offenses charged, proceed to the section entitled "Procedures-Not

Guilty Pleas."]

[Note 10. If the accused pleads guilty to one or

more offenses, proceed as follows.]

Procedures-guilty pleas

SCM:

I will now explain the meaning and effect of your pleas, and question

 you so that I can be sure you understand. Refer to the charge(s) and specification(s).

I will not accept your pleas of guilty unless you understand their meaning

and effect. You are legally and morally entitled to plead not guilty even

though you believe you are guilty, and to require that your guilt be proved

beyond a reasonable doubt. A plea of guilty is the strongest form of proof

known to the law. On your pleas of guilty alone, without receiving any evidence,

I can find you guilty of the offense(s) to which you have pleaded guilty.

I will not accept your pleas unless you realize that by your pleas you admit

every element of the offense(s) to which you have pleaded guilty, and that

you are pleading guilty because you really are guilty. If you are not convinced

that you are in fact guilty, you should not allow anything to influence you

to plead guilty. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

Do you have any questions?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

By your pleas of guilty you give up three very important rights.

(You keep these rights with respect to any offense(s) to which you have pleaded

not guilty.) The rights which you give up when you plead guilty are: 

First,

the right against self-incrimination. This means you give up the right to

say nothing at all about (this) (these) offense(s) to which you have pleaded

guilty. In a few minutes I will ask you questions about (this) (these) offense(s),

and you will have to answer my questions for me to accept your pleas of guilty. 

Second,

the right to a trial of the facts by this court-martial. This means you give

up the right to have me decide whether you are guilty based upon the evidence

which would be presented. 

Third, the right to be confronted by and to

cross-examine any witnesses against you. This means you give up the right

to have any witnesses against you appear, be sworn and testify, and to cross-examine

them under oath. 

Do you understand these rights?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

Do you understand that by pleading guilty you give up these rights?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

On your pleas of guilty alone you could be sentenced to .

[Note 11. Re-read the appropriate sentencing section

at notes 4 or 5 above unless the summary court-martial is a rehearing or

new or other trial, in which case _see_ R.C.M. 810(d).]

Do you have any questions about the sentence which could be imposed

 as a result of your pleas of guilty?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

Has anyone made any threat or tried in any other way to force you

to plead guilty?

ACC:

 .

Pretrial agreement

SCM:

Are you pleading guilty because of any promises or understandings

 between you and the convening authority or anyone else?

ACC:

 .

[Note 12. If the accused answers yes, the summary

 court-martial must inquire into the terms of such promises or understandings

in accordance with R.C.M. 910. _See_ Appendix 8, Note 35 through

 acceptance of plea.]

[Note 13. If the accused has pleaded guilty to

a lesser included offense, also ask the following question.]

Effect of guilty pleas to lesser included offenses

SCM:

Do you understand that your plea of guilty to the lesser included

 offense of  admits all the elements of the offense

 charged except the element(s) of , and that no proof is necessary to

 establish those elements admitted by your pleas?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

The following elements state what would have to be proved beyond

a reasonable doubt before the court-martial could find you guilty if you

had pleaded not guilty. As I read each of these elements to you, ask yourself

 whether each is true and whether you want to admit that each is true, and

then be prepared to discuss each of these elements with me when I have finished. 

The

elements of the offense(s) which your pleas of guilty admit are .

[Note 14. Read the elements of the offense(s) from

the appropriate punitive article in Part IV. This advice should be specific

as to names, dates, places, amounts, and acts.]

Do you understand each of the elements of the offense(s)?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

Do you believe, and admit, that taken together these elements correctly

describe what you did?

ACC:

 .

[Note 15. The summary court-martial should now

question the accused about the circumstances of the offense(s) to which the

accused has pleaded guilty. The accused will he placed under oath for this

purpose. _ See_ oath below. The purpose of these questions

is to develop the circumstances in the accused's own words, so that the summary

court-martial may determine whether each element of the offense(s) is established.]

Oath to accused for guilty plea inquiry

SCM:

Do you (swear) (affirm) that the statements you are about to make

 shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you

 God)?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

Do you have any questions about the meaning and effect of your pleas

 of guilty?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

Do you believe that you understand the meaning and effect of your

 pleas of guilty?

ACC:

 .

Determination of providence of pleas of guilty

[Note 16. Pleas of guilty may not be accepted unless

the summary court-martial finds that they are made voluntarily and with

understanding of their meaning and effect, and that the accused has knowingly,

 intelligently, and consciously waived the rights against self-incrimination,

to a trial of the facts by a court-martial, and to be confronted by the

witnesses. Pleas of guilty may be improvident when the accused makes statements

at any time during the trial which indicate that there may be a defense to

the offense(s), or which are otherwise inconsistent with an admission of

guilt. If the accused makes such statements and persists in them after questioning,

then the summary court-martial must reject the accused's guilty pleas and

enter pleas of not guilty for the accused. Turn to the section entitled "Procedures-Not

 Guilty Pleas" and continue as indicated. If (the) (any of the) accused's

 pleas of guilty are found provident, the summary court-martial should announce

 findings as follows.]

Acceptance of guilty pleas

SCM:

I find that the pleas of guilty are made voluntarily and with understanding

of their meaning and effect. I further specifically find that you have knowingly,

intelligently, and consciously waived your rights against self-incrimination,

to a trial of the facts by a court-martial, and to be confronted by the

witnesses against you. Accordingly, I find the pleas are provident, and I

accept them. However, you may ask to take back your guilty pleas at any time

before the sentence is announced. If you have a sound reason for your request,

I will grant it. Do you understand that?

ACC:

 .

If any not guilty pleas remain

[Note 17. If no pleas of not guilty remain, go

to note 26. If the accused has changed pleas of guilty to not guilty, if

the summary court-martial has entered pleas of not guilty to any charge(s)

and specification(s), or if the accused has pleaded not guilty to any of

the offenses or pleaded guilty to a lesser included offense, proceed as

follows.]

Witnesses for the accused

SCM:

If there are witnesses you would like to call to testify for you,

 give me the name, rank, and organization or address of each, and the reason

you think they should be here, and I will arrange to have them present if

their testimony would be material. Do you want to call witnesses?

ACC:

 .

[Note 18. The summary court-martial should estimate

the length of the case and arrange for the attendance of witnesses. The prosecution

 evidence should be presented before evidence for the defense.]

Calling witnesses

SCM:

I call as a witness .

Witness oath

SCM:

[To the witness, both standing] Raise your right

 hand.

Do you swear (or affirm) that the evidence you shall give in the

case now in hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but

the truth (, so help you God)? [Do not use the phrase, "so

help you God," if the witness prefers to affirm.]

WIT:

 .

SCM:

Be seated. State your full name, rank, organization, and armed force

 ([or if a civilian witness] full name, address, and occupation).

WIT:

 .

[Note 19. The summary court-martial should question

each witness concerning the alleged offense(s). After direct examination

of each witness, the accused must be given an opportunity to cross-examine.

If the accused declines to cross-examine the witness, the summary court-martial

should ask any questions that it feels the accused should have asked. If

 cross-examination occurs, the summary court-martial may ask questions on

 redirect examination and the accused may ask further questions in recross-examination.]

[Note 20. After each witness has testified, instruct

the witness as follows.]

SCM:

Do not discuss this case with anyone except the accused, counsel,

or myself until after the trial is over. Should anyone else attempt to discuss

 this case with you, refuse to do so and report the attempt to me immediately.

 Do you understand that?

WIT:

 .

SCM:

[To the witness]You are excused.

Recalling witnesses

[Note 2l. Witnesses may be recalled if necessary.

A witness who is recalled is still under oath and should be so reminded.]

[Note 22. After all witnesses against the accused

have been called and any other evidence has been presented, the summary

court-martial will announce the following.]

SCM:

That completes the evidence against you. I will now consider the

 evidence in your favor.

Presentation of defense case

[Note 23. Witnesses for the accused should now

be called to testify and other evidence should be presented. Before the defense

case is terminated the summary court-martial should ask the accused if there

are other matters the accused wants presented. If the accused has not testified,

the summary court-martial should remind the accused of the right to testify

or to remain silent.]

Closing argument

SCM:

I have now heard all of the evidence. You may make an argument on

 this evidence before I decide whether you are guilty or not guilty.

Deliberations on findings

[Note 24. The court-martial should normally close

for deliberations. If the summary court-martial decides to close, proceed

as follows.]

SCM:

The court-martial is closed so that I may review the evidence. Wait

 outside the courtroom until I recall you.

[Note 25. The summary court-martial should review

the evidence and applicable law. It must acquit the accused unless it is

convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by the evidence it has received in court

in the presence of the accused that each element of the alleged offense(s)

has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. _See_ R.C.M. 918.

It may not consider any facts which were not admitted into evidence, such

as a confession or admission of the accused which was excluded because it

was taken in violation of Mil. R. Evid. 304. The summary court-martial may

find the accused guilty of only the offense(s) charged, a lesser included

offense, or of an offense which does not change the identity of an offense

charged or a lesser included offense thereof.]

Announcing the findings

[Note 26. The summary court-martial should recall

the accused, who will stand before the court-martial when findings are announced.

 All findings including any findings of guilty resulting from guilty pleas,

should be announced at this time. The following forms should be used in announcing

findings.]

Not guilty of all offenses

SCM:

I find you of (the) (all) Charge(s) and Specification(s): Not Guilty.

Guilty of all offenses

I find you of (the) (all) Charge(s) and Specification(s): Guilty.

Guilty of some but not all

 offenses

I find you of (the) Specification () of

(the) Charge (): Not Guilty; of (the) Specification

() of (the) Charge (): Guilty;

of (the) Charge (): Guilty.

Guilty of lesser included offense or with exceptions and 

substitutions

I find you of (the Specification () of (the)

Charge 

(): Guilty, except the words  and ; (substituting therefor, respectively,

 the words  and ;) of the

 excepted words: Not Guilty; (of the substituted words: Guilty;) of the Charge:

 (Guilty) (Not Guilty, but Guilty of a violation of Article , UCMJ, a lesser included offense).

Entry of findings

[Note 27. The summary court-martial shall note

all findings on the record of trial.]

Procedure if total acquittal

[Note 28. If the accused has been found not guilty

of all charges and specifications, adjourn the court-martial, excuse the

accused, complete the record of trial, and return the charge sheet, personnel

records, allied papers, and record of trial to the convening authority.]

Procedure if any findings of guilty

[Note 29. If the accused has been found guilty

of any offense, proceed as follows.]

Presentence procedure

SCM:

I will now receive information in order to decide on an appropriate

 sentence. Look at the information concerning you on the front page of the

 charge sheet. Is it correct?

[Note 30. If the accused alleges that any of the

 information is incorrect, the summary court-martial must determine whether

it is correct and correct the charge sheet, if necessary.]

[Note 31. Evidence from the accused's personnel

records, including evidence favorable to the accused, should now be received

in accordance with R.C.M. 1001(b)(2). These records should be shown to the

 accused.]

SCM:

Do you know any reason why I should not consider these?

ACC:

 .

[Note 32. The summary court-martial shall resolve

 objections under R.C.M. 1002(b)(2) and the Military Rules of Evidence and

then proceed as follows. _See also_ R.C.M. 1001(b)(3), (4),

and (5) concerning other evidence which may be introduced.]

Extenuation and mitigation

SCM:

In addition to the information already admitted which is favorable

to you, and which I will consider, you may call witnesses who are reasonably

 available, you may present evidence, and you may make a statement. This

information may be to explain the circumstances of the offense(s), including

 any reasons for committing the offense(s), and to lessen the punishment for

the offense(s) regardless of the circumstances. You may show particular acts

of good conduct or bravery, and evidence of your reputation in the service

for efficiency, fidelity, obedience, temperance, courage, or any other trait

 desirable in a good servicemember. You may call available witnesses or you

may use letters, affidavits, certificates of military and civil officers,

or other similar writings. If you introduce such matters, I may receive written

evidence for the purpose of contradicting the matters you presented. If you

want me to get some military records that you would otherwise be unable to

obtain, give me a list of these documents. If you intend to introduce letters,

affidavits, or other documents, but you do not have them, tell me so that

I can help you get them. Do you understand that? 

ACC:

 .

Rights of accused to testify, remain silent, and make

 an

unsworn statement

SCM:

I informed you earlier of your right to testify under oath, to remain

 silent, and to make an unsworn statement about these matters.

SCM:

Do you understand these rights?

ACC:

 .

SCM:

Do you wish to call witnesses or introduce anything in writing?

ACC:

 .

[Note 33. If the accused wants the summary court-martial

 to obtain evidence, arrange to have the evidence produced as soon as practicable.]

[Note 34. The summary court-martial should now

receive evidence favorable to the accused. If the accused does not produce

evidence, the summary court-martial may do so if there are matters favorable

to the accused which should be presented.]

SCM:

Do you wish to testify or make an unsworn statement?

ACC:

 .

Questions concerning pleas of guilty

[Note 35. If as a result of matters received on

 sentencing, including the accused's testimony or an unsworn statement, any

 matter is disclosed which is inconsistent with the pleas of guilty, the summary

 court-martial must immediately inform the accused and resolve the matter.

 _See_ Note 16.]

Argument on sentence

SCM:

You may make an argument on an appropriate sentence.

ACC:

 .

Deliberations prior to

announcing sentence

[Note 36. After receiving all matters relevant

to sentencing, the summary court-martial should normally close for deliberations.

 If the summary court-martial decides to close, proceed as follows.]

Closing the court-martial

SCM:

This court-martial is closed for determination of the sentence.

Wait outside the courtroom until I recall you.

[Note 37. _See_ Appendix 11 concerning

 proper form of sentence. Once the summary court-martial has determined the

 sentence, it should reconvene the court-martial and announce the sentence

as follows.]

Announcement of sentence

SCM:

Please rise. I sentence you to .

[Note 38. If the sentence includes confinement,

advise the accused as follows.]

SCM:

You have the right to request in writing that [name of

convening authority] defer your sentence to confinement. Deferment

is not a form of clemency and is not the same as suspension of a sentence.

It merely postpones the running of a sentence to confinement.

[Note 39. Whether or not the sentence includes

 confinement, advise the accused as follows.]

SCM:

You have the right to submit in writing a petition or statement

to the convening authority. This statement may include any matters you feel

the convening authority should consider, a request for clemency, or both.

This statement must be submitted within 7 days, unless you request and convening

 authority approves an extension of up to 20 days. After the convening authority

 takes action, your case will be reviewed by a judge advocate for legal error.

 You may suggest, in writing, legal errors for the judge advocate to consider.

 If, after final action has been taken in your case, you believe that there

has been a legal error, you may request review of your case by The Judge

Advocate General of . Do you understand these rights?

ACC:

 .

Adjourning the court-martial

SCM:

This court-martial is adjourned.

Entry on charge sheet

[Note 40. Record the sentence in the record of

trial, inform the convening authority of the findings, recommendations for

suspension, if any, and any deferment request. If the sentence includes confinement,

# LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES

## 

This chart was compiled for convenience purposes only and is not the ultimate authority for specific lesser included offenses. Lesser offenses are those which are necessarily included in the offense charged. _See_ Article 79. Depending on the factual circumstances

 in each case, the offenses listed below may be considered lesser included. The elements of the proposed lesser included offense should be compared with the elements of the greater offense to determine if the elements of the lesser offense are derivative of the greater offense and vice versa. The "elements test" is the proper method for determining lesser included offenses. _See_ Appendix 23.

 Attempts to commit an offense may constitute a lesser included offense and are not listed. _See_ Article 80.

# GUIDE FOR PREPARATION OF RECORD OF TRIAL BY GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL AND

BY SPECIAL COURT-MARTIAL WHEN A VERBATIM RECORD IS NOT REQUIRED

## a. Record of trial

 If a verbatim record is not required

(_see_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(C) and (c)(2)), a summarized report of testimony,

objections, and other proceedings is permitted. In the event of an acquittal

of all charges and specifications, or termination of the proceedings prior

to findings by withdrawal, mistrial, dismissal, or were terminated after findings by approval of an administrative discharge in lieu of court-martial, the record may be further

summarized and need only contain sufficient information to establish lawful

 jurisdiction over the accused and the offenses. _See_ R.C.M.

 1103(e).

 

 This appendix is to be used as a general guide;

the actual record may depart from it as appropriate. The manner of summarizing

several items of procedure is shown in Appendix 14 _a_.

 Note. All pen and ink changes to the transcribed record

of trial shall be initialed. All pages in the transcribed record of trial

shall be numbered consecutively, beginning with "1." The page

 number shall be centered on the page 1/2 inch from the bottom. A margin

of 1 1/2 inches, or more as necessary, will be left at the top to permit

binding. A one-inch margin will be left on the bottom of the page and on

the left side of each page. The left margin will be increased as necessary

in the event that left-hand binding is used rather than top binding. If

left-hand binding is used, the top margin should be decreased to one-inch.

 Words on the margins of this appendix are not part of the form of record.

 All records of trial should begin as follows:

Guilty plea inquiry

The military judge inquired into the providence of the accused's

 pleas of guilty. The military judge informed the accused of: the right to

counsel [if the accused had no counsel]; of the right to

plead not guilty and to be tried by court-martial and that at such court-martial

the accused would have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses

against the accused and the right against self-incrimination; that by pleading

guilty the accused waived the rights to trial of the offense(s), to confront

and cross-examine witnesses, and against self-incrimination; and that the

military judge would question the accused, under oath, about the offense(s)

to which the accused pleaded guilty and that if the accused answered those

questions under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel, the

accused's answers could be used against the accused in a prosecution for

perjury or false statement. The accused stated that he/she understood these

rights. The military judge questioned the accused and determined that the

plea(s) of guilty (was) (were) voluntary and not the result of force or

threats or of promises (other than those in the pretrial agreement). The military

 judge informed the accused of the elements of the offense(s) and the maximum

punishment which could be imposed for (this) (these) offense(s). The accused

 stated that he/she understood. 

The military judge asked the accused about the offense(s) to which the accused pleaded guilty. Under oath the accused stated as follows:

Note. Here summarize the accused's description of the offense(s).

The military judge ascertained that there was (not) a pretrial

agreement in the case.

Note. If there was a pretrial agreement, the military judges's inquiry

 into it should be summarized. The following may be used as a guide:

The pretrial agreement was marked as Appellate Exhibit(s) . (The military judge did not examine Appellate Exhibit  at this time.) The military judge inquired and ensured that the

accused understood the agreement and that the parties agreed to its terms.

Note. If there was a question or dispute as to the meaning of any term

in the agreement, the resolution of that matter should be described.

Note. If the accused entered a conditional guilty plea (_see_ R.C.M. 910(a)(2)), this will be included in the record.

The military judge found the accused's pleas of guilty provident

and accepted them.

Note. If findings were entered (_see_ R.C.M. 910(g))

on any charges and specifications at this point, the record should so reflect. _

See_ FINDINGS below for format.

Note. If the accused pleaded not guilty to any charge(s) and specification(s)

which were not dismissed or withdrawn, in trial before military judge alone,

proceed with PRESENTATION OF PROSECUTION CASE. If the accused pleaded guilty

to all charge(s) and specification(s) in trial before military judge alone,

proceed with SENTENCING PROCEEDINGS below. If trial was before members proceed

with INITIAL SESSION WITH MEMBERS below.

Note. If the court-martial recessed, closed, or adjourned, or if an

 Article 39(a) session terminated and a session of the court-martial begins,

the record should indicate the time of the recess, closing, or adjournment,

and the time of reopening, using the following formats:

For example:

# INITIAL SESSION WITH MEMBERS

Note. Except in a special court-martial without a military judge, ordinarily

members will be first present at this point. In a special court-martial without

a military judge, ordinarily the members will be sworn and examined immediately

after the accused has been afforded the opportunity to request enlisted

members. In such cases, the following matters should be inserted at the appropriate

point in the record.

Members sworn

The members of the court-martial were sworn in accordance with R.C.M.

 807.

Note. If the military judge announced at this point that the court-martial

was assembled, the record should so reflect. If assembly was announced at

a different point, it should be so shown in the record.

Note. If the military judge gave preliminary instructions to members,

 this should be stated at the point at which they were given.

Preliminary instructions

The military judge instructed the members concerning their duties,

 the conduct of the proceedings, (). 

Note. If counsel examined the members concerning their qualifications,

 the record should so state. If any member was challenged for cause, the

grounds for challenge should he summarized. In addition, when a challenge

is denied, the challenged member's statements concerning the matter in question

should be summarized in the record. For example:

Trial and defense counsel examined the members concerning their

 qualifications. , member, was questioned concerning , and stated, under oath as follows:

My mind is not made up. I would consider all the evidence and the instructions

of the military judge before deciding on an appropriate sentence.

The defense challenged  for cause. The challenge was

denied. Neither side had any further challenges for cause. The trial counsel

challenged  peremptorily.

The defense counsel challenged  peremptorily (and stated that it would

have challenged another member had the challenge of  for

cause been sustained).

 and  were excused and withdrew from the courtroom. 

Note. If any part of the examination of members is done outside the

 presence of other members, this should be stated in the record. If challenges

are made at an Article 39(a) session this should be stated in the record.

Note. If the accused was arraigned at an Article 39(a) session, ordinarily

the military judge will have announced at this point to the members how the

# GUIDE FOR PREPARATION OF RECORD OF TRIAL BY GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL AND

BY SPECIAL COURT-MARTIAL WHEN A VERBATIM RECORD IS REQUIRED

## a. Record of trial.

The following guidelines apply to the preparation of all records

of trial by general and special courts-martial when a verbatim record of

trial is required by Rule for Courts-Martial 1103(b)(2)(B) and (c)(1).

### 1. Paper.

 All transcription will be completed only on one side of 8 1/2 x

11 inch paper. Use 15-pound or other high quality paper. Red-lined margins

and other legal formats, such as numbered lines, are acceptable so long

as they otherwise comport with the guidelines set forth herein.

### 2. Margins.

A margin of 1 1/2 inches, or more as necessary, will be left at

the top to permit binding. A one inch margin will be left on the bottom

of the page and on the left side of each page. The left margin will be

increased as necessary in the event that left hand binding is used rather

than top binding. If left-hand binding is used, the top margin should be

decreased to 1 inch.

### 3. Font.

Use 10-pitch (pica) on typewriters and 12 point type on computers.

 Only Courier, Times-Roman, or Times-New Roman fonts may be used. Do not

use cursive, script, or italic fonts, except when appropriate in specific

situations (_e.g._, citation). Use bold print for initial

identification of the members, military judge, court reporter, and the parties

to the trial. Certain standard stock entries (SSEs) will be in bold print

within verbatim records of trial, as reflected in this appendix's Guide for

Preparation of Trial (i.e., calling a witness, stage of examination, and

questions by counsel, members or the military judge. 

### 4. Line Spacing.

Double-space text, returning to the left margin on second and subsequent

lines, with the exception of pleas, findings, and sentence, which should

be single spaced, indented, and in bold print. Indent the elements of separate

offenses in guilty plea cases.

### 5. Justification.

Use left justification only with the exception of pleas, findings,

 and sentence, which may be justified both left and right.

### 6. Page Numbering.

All pages in the transcribed record of trial shall be numbered

consecutively, beginning with "1".  The page number shall be

centered on the page 1/2 inch from the bottom. 

### 7. Additional/Inserted Pages.

Use preceding page number plus either an alphanumeric letter after

 the corresponding whole numbered page (_e.g._ "19a")

or a decimal and an Arabic number after the corresponding whole numbered

page (_e.g._ "19.1").  Annotate the bottom of

the preceding page to reflect the following inserted page (_e.g._ "next

 page 19a" or "next page 19.1"). Be consistent throughout

the record of trial using either the alphanumeric or decimal system.  Annotate

the return to consecutive numbering at the bottom of the last inserted page

(_e.g._ "next page 20").

### 8. Omitted Page Numbers.

If a page number is omitted, but no page is actually missing from

the transcript, note the missing page at the bottom of the page preceding

the missing page number (_e.g._: "there is no page 22;

next page 23"). 

### 9. Printing.

All records of trial forwarded for review under UCMJ Articles 66

and 69(a) shall be printed in such a manner as to produce a letter quality

manuscript-a clear, solid, black imprint. All pen and ink changes

to the transcribed record of trial shall be initialed. 

### 10. Organization of Contents of Record of Trial.

The contents of a record of trial, including allied papers accompanying

the record, are set forth in R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(B), (2)(D), and (3). To the

extent applicable, the original record of trial shall contain signed originals

of pertinent documents. Absence of an original document will be explained,

and a certified true copy or signed duplicate original copy inserted in the

record of trial.  Arrangement of the contents of the record shall be as

set forth on DD Form 490, with heavy stock dividers used to separate major

components of the record as follows:

#### (A) DD Form 490, Front Cover.

 The

front cover will be followed by: (1) any orders transferring the accused

to a confinement facility or paperwork pertaining to excess/appellate leave; (2) appellate rights statement and the accused's election as to appellate counsel or any waiver thereof; (3) DD Form 494, "Court-Martial

Data Sheet", if any; (4) any briefs of counsel submitted after

trial; (5) court-martial orders promulgating the result of trial; (6) proof

of service on the defense counsel of the Staff Judge Advocate's recommendation

 and any response to the recommendation (if the defense response to the recommendation

is combined into one document with the matters submitted by the accused pursuant

to R.C.M. 1105, then the document should be placed in the record of trial

as if it were solely matters submitted by the accused pursuant to R.C.M.

1105); (7) either proof of service on the accused of the Staff Judge

Advocate's recommendation or a statement explaining why the accused was

not served personally; (8) signed review of the Staff Judge Advocate

pursuant to Article 32,

if any, and all related exhibits

and attachments.  The original, signed investigation will be placed in the

original copy of the record of trial.

#### (C) Pretrial Allied Papers.

 These

papers should include: (1) advice of the Staff Judge Advocate or legal

officer; (2) requests by counsel and action of the convening authority

taken thereon; (3) any other papers, endorsements, investigations which

accompanied the charges when referred for trial; (4) record of any former

trial.

#### (D) Record of Proceedings of Court-Martial,

 in the following order: (1) errata sheet; (2) index sheet with reverse side containing receipt of accused or defense counsel for copy of

record or certificate in lieu of receipt;

 _Note.

_ The preprinted index may be inadequate to properly reflect the

proceedings, witnesses, and exhibits. Court reporters should liberally expand

the index and use additional sheets as necessary. Special attention should

be paid to noting the pages at which exhibits are offered and accepted/rejected,

to include annotating those page numbers on the bottom of an exhibit, as

 appropriate.

(3) convening and all amending orders;

(4) any written orders detailing the military judge or counsel; (5) request

for trial by military judge alone if not marked as an appellate exhibit;

(6) any written request for enlisted members if not marked as an appellate

exhibit; (7) verbatim transcript of the proceedings of the court, including

all Article 39(a) sessions and original DD Form 458, "Charge Sheet";

 (8) authentication sheet followed by Certificate of Correction, if any;

 (9) action of convening authority and, if appropriate, action of officer

exercising general court-martial jurisdiction.

 _Note._ Any necessary assumption of command orders should be included

in the record of trial. 

#### (E) Post-trial sessions.

 Post-trial

sessions will be authenticated and served in accordance with R.C.M. 1103,

and are part of the record of trial. Page numbering should continue in sequence

from the end of the transcript of the original proceedings, and will be

separately authenticated if the initial proceedings have been previously

authenticated.  Additional exhibits should be lettered or numbered in sequence,

following those already marked/admitted.

#### (F) Prosecution Exhibits admitted into evidence.

 

[The page(s) at which an exhibit is offered and admitted should

be noted at the bottom of the exhibit, as appropriate, as well as noting

those pages on the DD Form 490.]

#### (G) Defense Exhibits admitted into evidence.

 

[The page(s) at which an exhibit is offered and admitted should

be noted at the bottom of the exhibit, as appropriate, as well as noting

those pages on the DD Form 490.]

#### (H) Prosecution Exhibits marked but not offered and/or

admitted into evidence.

 [The page(s) at which

an exhibit is offered and rejected should be noted at the bottom of the exhibit,

 as appropriate, as well as noting those pages on the DD Form 490.]

#### (I) Defense Exhibits marked but not offered and/or admitted

into evidence.

 [The page(s) at which an exhibit

is offered and rejected should be noted at the bottom of the exhibit, as

appropriate, as well as noting those pages on the DD Form 490.]

#### (J) Appellate Exhibits.

 [The

page(s) at which an exhibit is marked should be noted at the bottom of the

exhibit, as appropriate, as well as noting those pages on the DD Form 490.]

#### (K) Any records of proceedings in connection with vacation

of suspension.

### 11. Stock Dividers.

The foregoing bullets will be separated by the use of heavy stock

 dividers, colored, and labeled with gummed labels.

### 12. Binding.

Volumes of the record will be bound at the top with metal or plastic

 fasteners. Top or left-side binding is acceptable with sufficient adjustment

to the top or left margin.  Volumes shall be bound to withstand repeated

handling, utilizing DD Form 490. **Do not sew or stack fasteners together

in gangs to bind thick volumes.** 

### 13. Dividing Records into Volumes.

Divide ROTs that are over 1.5 inches thick into separate volumes.

 Make the first volume of a multi-volume record an inch thick or smaller.

 This will allow for inclusion of the SJA recommendation, clemency matters,

and other post-trial documents. Limit subsequent volumes to 1.5 inches thick,

unless dividing them requires assembling an additional volume smaller than .5 inches thick. If the transcript is split into two or more volumes, indicate

on the front cover which pages of the transcript are in which volume.

(_e.g._: "Volume 1 of 4, Transcript, pages 1-300"). Number each volume

of the ROT as follows: "Volume 1 of ."

 In the upper right-hand corner of the DD Form 490, label the ROT to reflect

which copy it is, i.e., "ORIGINAL," "ACCUSED," et

cetera.

### 14. Use of this Guide.

 Words on the margins of this appendix are not part

of the form of record. As a general rule, all proceedings in the case should be recorded verbatim. _See_ R.C.M. 1103. Following this appendix does not necessarily produce a complete record of trial. It

is to be used by the reporter and trial counsel as a guide in the preparation

of the completed record of trial in all general and special court-martial

cases in which a verbatim record is required.

# PROCEEDINGS OF A SPECIAL/GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL

[The military judge called the Article 39(a) session to

order at/on board 

 at, hours,   , 

 pursuant to the following orders:] 

[Court-Martial

Convening Order Number  , , dated   .]         (command

that issued the order) 

 **[END OF PAGE]**

 _Note._ Here insert a copy of the orders convening the

 court-martial and copies of any amending orders. Copies of any written orders

 detailing the military judge and counsel will be inserted here._ See

_ R.C.M. 503(b) and (c). Any request of an enlisted accused for enlisted

court members will be inserted immediately following the convening orders,

together with any declaration of the nonavailability of such enlisted persons

unless marked as an appellate exhibit. _See_ R.C.M.503(a)(2),

903. Any written request for trial by military judge alone (R.C.M. 903) or

statement that a military judge could not be obtained (R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B)(ii))

will be inserted at this point unless marked as an appellate exhibit.

MJ: This Article 39(a) session is called to order.

TC: This court-martial is convened by ....

_Note._ The reporter records all the proceedings verbatim

from the time the military judge calls the court to order. Thereafter, the

reporter will use only standard stock entries, reporter's notes, or gestures.

SSEs, Reporter's Notes and Gestures

_Note._ SSEs, reporter's notes, and gestures (non-verbatim

 observations) will be placed in brackets, with the exception of SSEs identifying

witnesses, stages of examination, and individual voir dire.

Paragraphing

_Note._ The court reporter shall utilize proper paragraphing

 techniques (i.e., a new line of thought starts a new paragraph) when typing

 long narratives, such as the military judge's instructions, counsel arguments,

 and lengthy "Q and A." Additionally, start a new paragraph for each separate

 element in a list; i.e., elements of an offense, legal definitions, accused's

 rights, and oral stipulations.

Punctuation Marks

_Note._ Do not use exclamation marks, capital letters,

bolding, or italics to inject emphasis into the record of trial. Two hyphens

(--) or a one em dash (-) may be used where the speaker changes thought

 or subject and four hyphens (----) or a two em dashes (- -)

may be used where one participant interrupts another. Use periods at the

end of complete thoughts to avoid lengthy sentences. Avoid phonetic spelling.

Prefixes

_Note._ Indent 5 spaces from the left margin and type

the appropriate prefix to indicate identity of the speaker followed by a

colon and two spaces.

Questions and Answer

_Note._ When typing "Q and A," ensure at least two lines,

or the entire text of a question or answer appear at the bottom of a page.

 Page break in appropriate places where necessary. Do not repeat the "Q"

or "A" prefix at the top of the next page. To the extent practicable, use

page breaks so that the answer to a question does not appear on a page separate

from the question.

Sessions of court

_Note._ Each session of court, as well as each Article

39(a) session or bench conference, shall commence on a new page, separate

from the other transcribed proceedings. The reporter should note the time

and date of the beginning and ending of each session of the court, including

the opening and closing of the court-martial during trial. For example:

[The (court-martial) (session) was called to order at  hours,  .]

[The

(court-martial) (session) was (adjourned) (recessed) at  hours,  .] 

[The

court-martial closed at  hours,  .] 

Administration of oaths

Note. It is not necessary to record verbatim the oath actually used,

 whether it be administered to a witness, the military judge, counsel, or

the members. Regardless of the form of oath, affirmation, or ceremony by

which the conscience of the witness is bound, R.C.M. 807, only the fact that

a witness took an oath or affirmation is to be recorded. However, if preliminary

qualifying questions are asked a witness prior to the administration of an

 oath, the questions and answers should be recorded verbatim. These preliminary

questions and answers do not eliminate the requirement that an oath be administered.

The following are examples of the recording of the administration of various

oaths:

[The detailed reporter, , was

sworn.] 

[The detailed interpreter, , was sworn.] 

[The military judge and the

personnel of the prosecution and defense were sworn.] 

[The

members were sworn.] 

Accounting for personnel during trial

Note. After the reporter is sworn, the reporter will record verbatim

the statements, of the trial counsel with respect to the presence of personnel

of the court-martial, counsel, and the accused.

 The reporter should note whether, when a witness is excused, the witness withdraws from the courtroom

or, in the case of the accused, whether the accused resumes a seat at counsel

table. Similarly, if the military judge excuses a member as a result of challenge

and the member withdraws, the reporter should note this fact in the record.

In a special court-martial without a military judge, if a challenged member

withdraws from the court-martial while it votes on a challenge, and then is

excused as a result of challenge or resumes a seat after the court-martial

has voted on a challenge, the reporter should note this fact in the record.

Examples of the manner in which such facts should be recorded are as follows:

[The (witness withdrew from the courtroom) (accused resumed

his/her seat at the counsel table).] 

[, the challenged member, withdrew from the courtroom.] 

[, resumed his/her seat as a member of the court-martial.]

Arraignment

tried by the  court-martial convened by  , dated  , (at) (on board) , on   , is corrected by the insertion on

page , immediately following line  , of the following: 

"[The detailed

# Record of Trial by Summary Court-Martial (DD Form 2329)

# FORMS FOR ACTIONS

 The forms in this appendix are guides for preparation of the convening

authority's initial action. Guidance is also provided for actions under R.C.M.

1112(f). Appendix 17 contains forms for later actions. The forms are guidance

only, and are not mandatory. They do not provide for all cases. It may be

necessary to combine parts of different forms to prepare an action appropriate

to a specific case. Extreme care should be exercised in using these forms

and in preparing actions. _ See_ R.C.M. 1107(f) concerning

 contents of the convening authority's action. 

  In addition to

the matters contained in the forms below, the action should show the headquarters

and place, or the ship, of the convening authority taking the action, and

the date of the action. The signature of the convening authority is followed

by the grade and unit of the convening authority, and "commander"

or "commanding" as appropriate. 

 When the sentence includes confinement, the place of confinement is designated in the action un-less the Secretary concerned prescribes otherwise. If the place of confinement is designated in the action, service regulations should be consulted first. _See_ R.C.M. 1113(d)(2)(C).

 In actions on a summary court-martial,

when the action is written on the record of trial (_see_ Appendix

15) the words "In the case of  " may be

omitted.

# INITIAL ACTION ON COURT-MARTIAL SENTENCE-FINDINGS NOT AFFECTED

**Forms 1-10 are appropriate when the adjudged sentence does

not include death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge.** 

_Adjudged sentence approved and ordered executed without modification._ _

See_ R.C.M. 1107(f)(4).

In the case of , the sentence is approved

 and will be executed. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Adjudged sentence modified._ _

See_ R.C.M. 1107(d)(1), (f)(4). 

_Adjudged sentence approved in part and ordered executed._ 

In the case of , only so much of the sentence as provides

for  is approved and will be executed. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Adjudged sentence approved; part of confinement changed to forfeiture of pay._

 

In the case of , so much of the sentence extending

to  months of confinement is changed to forfeiture of $ pay per month for  months. The sentence as changed is approved and will be executed. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Credit for illegal pretrial confinement_. _See_ R.C.M. 305(k); 1107(f)(4)(F).

 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and will be executed. The accused will be credited with days of confinement against the sentence to confinement. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Suspension of sentence._ _See_ R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(B); 1108(d). 

_Adjudged sentence approved and suspended._ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved. Execution of the sentence is suspended for (months) (years) at which time, unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the sentence will be remitted without further action.

_Adjudged sentence approved; part of sentence suspended._ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and will be executed but the execution of that part of the sentence extending to (confinement) (confinement in excess of months) (forfeiture of pay) () is suspended for  (months) (years), at which time, unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the suspended part of the sentence will be remitted without further action. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Deferment of confinement and termination of deferment._ _See

_ R.C.M. 1101(c); 1107(f)(4)(E). 

_Adjudged sentence approved; confinement deferred pending final review._ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and, except for that portion extending to confinement, will be executed. Service of the sentence to confinement (is) (was) deferred effective (date), and will not begin until (the conviction is final) (date) (), unless sooner rescinded by competent authority.

_Adjudged sentence approved;

deferment of confinement terminated._ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and will be executed. The service of the sentence to confinement was deferred on (date). ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Adjudged sentence approved; deferment of confinement terminated previously.

_ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and will be executed. The service of the sentence to confinement was deferred on (date), and the deferment ended on (date). ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Disapproval of sentence; rehearing on sentence only ordered._ _

See_ R.C.M. 1107(e), (f)(4)(A). 

In the case of , it appears that the following error was committed: (evidence of a  previous conviction of the accused was erroneously admitted) (). This error was prejudicial as to the sentence. The sentence is disapproved. A rehearing is ordered before a (summary) (special) (general) court-martial to be designated.

 When the adjudged sentence includes death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or a bad-conduct discharge, forms 1-10 are generally appropriate, but several will require modification depending on the action to be taken. This is because death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge may not be ordered executed in the initial action. Therefore, unless an adjudged punishment of death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is disapproved, changed to another punishment, or (except in the case of death) suspended, the initial action must specifically except such punishments from the order of execution. This is done by adding the words "except for the part of the sentence extending to (death) (dismissal) (dishonorable discharge) (bad-conduct discharge)," after the words "is approved and" and before the words "will be executed" in the action. (A death sentence cannot be suspended. _See_ R.C.M. 1108(b).)

 **Forms 11-14 provide examples of actions when the sentence includes death, dismissal,

or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge.** 

_Adjudged sentence approved and, except for death, dismissal, or discharge, ordered executed.

_ _See_ R.C.M. 1107(f)(4). 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and, except for the part of the sentence extending to (death) (dismissal) (dishonorable discharge) (bad-conduct discharge), will be executed. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Adjudged sentence modified._ _See_ R.C.M. 1107(d)(1),

(f)(4). If the part of the sentence providing for death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or a bad-conduct discharge is disapproved, _see_ Form 2 above. 

In the case of , only so much of the sentence as provides for (death) (dismissal) (a dishonorable discharge) (a bad-conduct discharge) (and  [specify each approved punishment]) is approved and, except for the part of the sentence extending to (death) (dismissal) (dishonorable discharge) (bad-conduct discharge), will be executed. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Adjudged sentence approved; discharge changed to confinement.

_

In the case of , so much of the sentence extending to a (dishonorable discharge) (bad-conduct discharge) is changed to confinement for months (thereby making the period of confinement total months). The sentence as changed is approved and will be executed. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Suspension of sentence._ _See_ R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(B); 1108(d). If the portion of the sentence extending to dismissal or a dishonorable or a bad-conduct discharge is suspended, Form 5 or Form 6 may be used, as appropriate. If parts of the sentence other than an approved dismissal or discharge are suspended, the following form may be used:

_Adjudged sentence approved; part of sentence, other than dismissal or dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, suspended._ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and, except for that part of the sentence extending to (dismissal) (a dishonorable discharge) (a bad-conduct discharge), will be executed, but the execution of that part of the sentence adjudging (confinement) (confinement in excess of) (forfeiture of pay) () is suspended for (months) (years) at which time, unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the suspended part of the sentence will be remitted without further action. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

# INITIAL ACTION ON COURT-MARTIAL WHEN FINDINGS AFFECTED

Findings are addressed in the action only when

any findings of guilty are disapproved, in whole or part. _See_ R.C.M. 1107(c), (f)(3). The action must also indicate what action is being taken on the sentence. Appropriate parts of the foregoing forms for action on the sentence may be substituted in the following examples as necessary. 

_Some findings of guilty disapproved; adjudged sentence approved._ 

In the case of , the finding of guilty of Specification 2, Charge I is disapproved. Specification 2, Charge I is dismissed. The sentence is approved and (, except for that part of the sentence extending to ((dismissal) (a dishonorable discharge) (a bad-conduct discharge),) will be executed. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Finding of guilty of lesser included offense approved; adjudged sentence modified._ 

In the case of , the finding of guilty of Specification 1, Charge II is changed to a finding of guilty of (assault with a means likely to produce grievous bodily harm, to wit: a knife) (absence without authority from the (unit) (ship) () alleged from (date) to (date) in violation of Article 86) (). Only so much of the sentence as provides for  is approved and (, except for the part of the sentence extending to ((dismissal) (dishonorable discharge) (bad-conduct discharge)), will be executed. ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

_Some findings of guilty and sentence disapproved;

combined rehearing ordered_. _See_ 1107(e). A rehearing may not be ordered if any sentence is approved.  _See_ R.C.M. 1107(c)(2)(B); (e)(1)(c)(i).

In the case of , it appears that the following error was committed: (Exhibit 1, a laboratory report, was not properly authenticated and was admitted over the objection of the defense) (). This error was prejudicial as to Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge II. The findings of guilty as to Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge II and the sentence are disapproved. A combined rehearing is ordered before a court-martial to be designated.

_All findings of guilty and sentence disapproved;

rehearing ordered._ _See_ R.C.M. 1107(c)(2)(B). 

In the case of , it appears that the following error was committed: (evidence offered by the defense to establish duress was improperly excluded) (). This error was prejudicial to the rights of the accused as to all findings of guilty. The findings of guilty and the sentence are disapproved. A rehearing is ordered before a court-martial to be designated.

_All findings of guilty and sentence disapproved based on jurisdictional error; another trial ordered._ _See_ R.C.M. 1107(e)(2). This form may also be used when a specification

fails to state an offense. 

In the case of , it appears that (the members were not detailed to the court-martial by the convening authority) (). The proceedings, findings, and sentence are invalid. Another trial is ordered before a court-martial to be designated.

_All findings of guilty and sentence disapproved; charges dismissed._ _

See_ R.C.M. 1107(c)(2)(B). 

In the case of , the findings of guilty and the sentence are disapproved. The charges are dismissed.

# ACTION ON A REHEARING

The action on a rehearing is the same as an action on an original court-martial in most respects. It differs first in that, as to any sentence approved following the rehearing, the accused must be credited with those parts of the sentence previously executed or otherwise served. Second, in certain cases the convening authority must provide for the restoration of certain rights, privileges, and property. _See_ R.C.M. 1107(f)(5)(A). 

_

Action on rehearing; granting credit for previously executed or served punishment.

_ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and (, except for the portion of the sentence extending to ((dismissal) (dishonorable discharge) (bad-conduct discharge)), will be executed.

All rights, privileges, and property of which the accused has been deprived by virtue of the execution of the sentence adjudged at the former trial of this case on (date) will be restored.

# WITHDRAWAL OF PREVIOUS ACTION

Form 24 is appropriate for withdrawal of an earlier action. See R.C.M. 1107(f)(2) concerning modification of an earlier action. Form 24a is appropriate for withdrawal of previous action pursuant to instructions from reviewing authority pursuant to R.C.M. 1107(f)(2) or (g). When the action of a predecessor in command is withdrawn due to ambiguity, _see United States v. Lower_, 10 M.J. 263 (C.M.A. 1981).

In the case of , the action taken by (me) (my predecessor in command) on (date) is withdrawn and the following substituted therefor:

.

In the case of , in accordance with instructions from (The Judge Advocate General) (the Court of Criminal Appeals) pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial [1107(f)(2)]

[1107(g)], the action taken by (me) (my predecessor in command) is withdrawn. The following is substituted therefor: 

.

# FORMS FOR ACTIONS APPROVING AND SUSPENDING PUNISHMENTS MENTIONED IN ARTICLE 58a AND RETAINING ACCUSED IN PRESENT  OR INTERMEDIATE GRADE.

 Under the authority of Article 58a, the Secretary concerned may, by regulation, limit or specifically preclude the reduction in grade which would otherwise be effected under that Article upon the approval of certain court-martial sentences by the convening authority. The Secretary concerned may provide in regulations that if the convening or higher authority taking action on the case suspends those elements of the sentence that are specified in Article 58a the accused may be retained in the grade held by the accused at the time of the sentence or in any intermediate grade. Forms 25-27 may be used by the convening or higher authority in effecting actions authorized by the Secretary concerned in regulations pursuant to the authority of Article 58a.

 If the convening authority or higher authority, when taking action on a case in which the sentence includes a punitive discharge, confinement, or hard labor without confinement, elects to approve the sentence and to retain the enlisted member in the grade held by that member at the time of sentence or in any intermediate grade, that authority may do so if permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned whether or not the sentence also includes a reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, by using one of the following forms of action. The first action, Form 25, is appropriate when the sentence does not specifically provide for reduction. The second and third actions, Forms 26 and 27, are appropriate when the sentence specifically provides for reduction to the grade of     E-1. The action set forth in Form 26 is intended for a case in which the accused is to be probationally retained in the grade held by that accused at the time of sentence. The action set forth in Form 27 is for a case in which the accused is to serve probationally in an intermediate grade.

_Automatic reduction suspended; sentence does not

specifically include reduction.

_ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and will be executed, but the execution of that part of the sentence extending to (a dishonorable discharge) (a bad-conduct discharge) (confinement) (hard labor without confinement) (and) is suspended for (months) (years) at which time, unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the suspended part of the sentence will be remitted without further action. The accused will (continue to) serve in the grade of unless the suspension of (the dishonorable discharge) (the bad-conduct discharge) (confinement) (hard labor without confinement) is vacated, in which event the accused will be reduced to the grade of E-1 at that time.

_Automatic reduction and adjudged reduction to E-l suspended; accused retained in grade previously held._ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and will be executed, but the execution of that part of the sentence extending to (a dishonorable discharge) (a bad-conduct discharge) (confinement) (hard labor without confinement) (), and reduction to the grade of E-1, is suspended for  (months) (years), at which time, unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the suspended part of the sentence will be remitted without further action. The accused will continue to serve in the grade of  unless the suspension of (the dishonorable discharge) (the bad-conduct discharge) (confinement) (hard labor without confinement), or reduction to the grade of   E-1, is vacated, in which event the accused will be reduced to the grade of E-1 at that time.

_

Automatic reduction and adjudged reduction to E-l suspended; accused retained in intermediate grade._ 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and will be executed but the execution of that part of the sentence extending to (a dishonorable discharge) (a bad-conduct discharge) (confinement) (hard labor without confinement), and that part of the reduction which is in excess of reduction to the grade of  is suspended for  (months) (years) at which time, unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the  suspended part of the sentence will be remitted without further action. The accused will serve in the grade of  unless the suspension of (the dishonorable discharge) (bad-conduct discharge) (confinement) (hard labor without confinement), or reduction to the grade of E-1, is vacated, in which event the accused will be reduced to the grade of E-1 at that time.

ACTION UNDER R.C.M. 1112(f). The forms for action for the officer taking action under R.C.M. 1112(f) are generally similar to the foregoing actions. The officer taking action under R.C.M. 1112 (f) may order executed all parts of the approved sentence, including a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, except those parts which have been suspended without later vacation unless the record must be forwarded under R.C.M. 1112(g)(1). _See_ R.C.M. 1113(c)(1)(A). The following are additional forms which may be appropriate:

_

Sentence approved when convening authority suspended all or part of it._

In the case of , the sentence as approved and suspended by the convening authority is approved.

_Sentence approved and, when confinement was deferred, ordered executed._ _

See_ R.C.M. 1101(c)(6). 

In the case of , the sentence is approved and the confinement will be executed. The service of the sentence to confinement was deferred on (date). ( is designated as the place of confinement.)

In the case of , the sentence is approved. The (dishonorable discharge) (bad-conduct discharge) will be executed.

_Findings and sentence disapproved; restoration as to parts ordered executed by convening authority.  See _ R.C.M. 1208(b). 

In the case of , the findings of guilty and the sentence are disapproved. The charges are dismissed. (The accused will be released from the confinement adjudged by the sentence in this case and all) (All) rights, privileges, and property of which the accused has been deprived by virtue of the findings and sentence disapproved will be restored.

_

Findings and sentence disapproved; rehearing authorized._ _

See_ R.C.M. 1112(f). 

In the case of , it appears that the following error was committed: (Exhibit 1, a  statement of the accused, was not shown to have been preceded by Article 31 warnings as required and was admitted over the objection of the defense) (). This error was prejudicial to the rights of the accused as to the findings and the sentence. The case is returned to the convening authority who may order a rehearing or dismiss the charges.

_Action taken is less favorable to the

accused than that recommended by the judge advocate._ _See

_ R.C.M. 1112(e), (f). 

In the case of , the sentence is approved. As this action is less favorable to the accused than that recommended by the judge advocate, the record and this action shall be forwarded to the Judge Advocate General for review under Article 69(b).

_Action when approved sentence includes dismissal._ _See_ R.C.M.

1113(c)(2).

## Introduction

 The Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984, includes

Executive Order No. 12473 signed by President Reagan on 13 April 1984. This

publication also contains various supplementary materials for the convenience

of the user. 

 _History of the Manual for Courts-Martial.

_ The President traditionally has exercised the power to make rules

for the government of the military establishment, including rules governing

courts-martial. _See_ W. Winthrop, _Military Law and

Precedents_ 27-28 (2d ed. 1920 reprint). Such rules have been

promulgated under the President's authority as commander-in-chief, _

see_ U.S. Const., Art. II, sec. 2, cl.1., and, at least since 1813,

such power also has been provided for in statutes. _See_ W.

Winthrop, _supra_ at 26-27. In 1875 Congress specifically

provided for the President to make rules for the government of courts-martial.

Act of March 1, 1775, Ch. 115. 18 Stat. 337. Similar authority was included

in later statutes (_see e.g._, A.W. 38 (1916)), and continues

in Article 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. _See also_ Articles

18 and 56. _See generally Hearings on H.R. 3804 Before the Military

Personnel Subcom. of the House Comm. on Armed Services_, 96th Cong.,

1st Sess. 5-6, 14, 17-18, 20-21, 52, 106 (1979). In 1979,

Article 36 was amended to clarify the broad scope of the President's rulemaking

authority for courts-martial. Act of November 9, 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-107,

Section 801(b), 93 Stat. 810,811. _See generally Hearings on H.R.

3804, supra_. 

 In the nineteenth century the President

promulgated, from time to time, regulations for the Army. Those regulations

were published in various forms, including "Manuals". W. Winthrop, _

supra_ at 28. Such publications were not limited to court-martial

procedures and related matters; however, they were more in the nature of

compendiums of military law and regulations. The early manuals for courts-martial

were informal guides and were not promulgated by the President. _See

_ MCM, 1895 at 1, 2; MCM, 1905 at 3; MCM, 1910 at 3; MCM, 1917 at

III. _See also_ MCM, 1921 at XIX. 

 The forerunner

of the modern _Manual for Courts-Martial_ was promulgated by

the Secretary of War in 1895. _See_ MCM, 1895 at 2. _

See also_ Hearings on H.R. 3805, _supra_ at 5. (Earlier

Manuals were prepared by individual authors. _See e.g._, A.

Murray, _A Manual for Courts-Martial_ (3d ed. 1893); H. Coppee,

 _Field manual for Courts-Martial_ (1863)). Subsequent Manuals

through MCM, 1969 (Rev.) have had the same basic format, organization, and

subject matter as MCM, 1895, although the contents have been modified and

considerably expanded. _See e.g._, MCM, 1921 at XIX-XX.

The format has been a paragraph format, numbered consecutively and divided

into chapters. The subject matter has included pretrial, trial, and post-trial

procedure. In MCM, 1917, rules of evidence and explanatory materials on the

punitive articles were included. _See_, MCM, 1917 at XIV.

The President first promulgated the Manual for Courts-Martial as such in 1921. _

See_ MCM, 1921 at XXVI. 

 _Background of this Manual.

_ During the drafting of the Military Rules of Evidence

(_see_ Analysis, Part III, introduction, _infra_), the

drafters identified several portions of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) in specific areas.

However, the project to draft the Military Rules of Evidence had demonstrated

the value of a more comprehensive examination of existing law. In addition,

changing the format of the Manual for Courts-Martial was considered desirable.

 In this regard it should be noted that, as indicated above, the basic format

and organization of the Manual for Courts-Martial had remained the same for

over 80 years, although court-martial practice and procedure had changed

substantially. 

 Upon completion of the Military Rules of Evidence

in early 1980, the General Counsel, Department of Defense, with the concurrence

of the Judge Advocates General, directed that the Manual for Courts-Martial

 be revised. There were four basic goals for the revision. First, the new

Manual was to conform to federal practice to the extent possible, except

where the Uniform Code of Military Justice requires otherwise or where specific

 military requirements render such conformity impracticable. _See_ Article

36. Second, current court-martial practice and applicable judicial precedent

was to be thoroughly examined and the Manual was to be brought up to date,

by modifying such practice and precedent or conforming to it as appropriate.

Third, the format of the Manual was to be modified to make it more useful

to lawyers (both military and civilian) and nonlawyers. Specifically, a rule

as opposed to paragraph format was to be used and prescriptive rules would

be separated from nonbinding discussion. Fourth, the procedures in the new

Manual had to be workable across the spectrum of circumstances in which courts-martial

are conducted, including combat conditions. 

 These goals were intended

to ensure that the Manual for Courts-Martial continues to fulfill its fundamental

purpose as a comprehensive body of law governing the trial of courts-martial

and as a guide for lawyers and nonlawyers in the operation and application

of such law. It was recognized that no single source could resolve all issues

or answer all questions in the criminal process. However, it was determined

that the Manual for Courts-Martial should be sufficiently comprehensive, accessible,

and understandable so it could be reliably used to dispose of matters in

the military justice system properly, without the necessity to consult other

sources, as much as reasonably possible. 

 The Joint-Service Committee

on Military Justice was tasked with the project. The Joint-Service Committee

consists of representatives from each of the armed forces, and a nonvoting

representative from the Court of Military Appeals. Since 1980 the Joint-Service

Committee has consisted of Colonel (later Brigadier General) Donald W. Hansen,

USA, 1980-July 1981 (Chairman, October 1980-July 1981); Colonel Kenneth

A. Raby, USA, July 1981-January 1984 (Chairman, July 1981-September

1982); Captain Edward M. Byrne, USN, 1980-July 1981 (Chairman through

September 1980); Captain John J. Gregory, USN, July 1981-January 1984;

Colonel Richard T. Yery USAF, 1980-March 1982; Colonel John E. Hilliard,

USAF, March 1982-October 1983 (Chairman, October 1982-October

1983); Colonel Thomas L. Hemingway, USAF, October 1983-January 1984 (Chairman,

October 1983-January 1984); Lieutenant Colonel A.F. Mielczarski, USMC,

1980-July 1982; Lieutenant Colonel G.W. Bond, USMC, July 1982-October

1982, Lieutenant Colonel Gary D. Solis, USMC, October 1982-March 1983;

Lieutenant Colonel George Lange, III, USMC, June 1983-January 1984;

Commander William H. Norris, USCG, 1980-August 1981; Commander Thomas

B. Snook, USCG, August 1981-September 1983; Captain William B. Steinbach,

USCG, October 1983-January 1984; and Mr. Robert H. Mueller of the Court

 of Military Appeals (1980-January 1984). 

 In the summer

of 1980, Commander James E. Pinnell, USN, and Major Frederic I. Lederer, USA,

prepared an initial outline of the new Manual. 

 Drafting was done

by the Working Group of the Joint-Service Committee on Military Justice. Since

 September 1980, when the drafting process began, the Working Group consisted

of: Major John S. Cooke, USA (Chairman); Commander James E. Pinnell, USN;

Lieutenant Colonel Richard R. James, USAF (1980-December 1982); Lieutenant

Colonel Robert Leonard, USAF (December 1982 to January 1984); Major Jonathan

R. Rubens, USMC; and Mr. John Cutts, and Mr. Robert Mueller of the staff

of the Court of Military Appeals. Mr. Francis X. Gindhart and Mr. Jack McKay

of the staff of the Court of Military Appeals also participated early in the

drafting process. Clerical support was provided by the Court of Military

Appeals. In this regard, Mrs. Gail L. Bissi has been instrumental in the

success of this project. 

 The Working Group drafted the Manual

in fourteen increments. Each increment was circulated by each service to

various field offices for comment. Following such comment, each increment

was reviewed in the respective offices of the Judge Advocate General, the

Director, Judge Advocate Division, Headquarters, USMC, and the Chief Counsel,

USCG, and in the Court of Military Appeals. Following such review, the Joint-Service

 Committee met and took action on each increment. After all increments had

been reviewed and approved, the Code Committee approved the draft. At this

time the Code Committee consisted of Chief Judge Robinson O. Everett, Judge

William H. Cook, and Judge Albert B. Fletcher, of the Court of Military Appeals;

Rear Admiral James J. McHugh, the Judge Advocate General, USN; Major General

Hugh J. Clausen, The Judge Advocate General, USA; Major General Thomas Bruton,

The Judge Advocate General, USAF; and Rear Admiral Edward Daniels, Chief

Counsel, USCG. Brigadier General William H. J. Tiernan, USMC, also sat as

an _ex officio_ member. 

 Following approval by the

Code Committee, the draft was made available for comment by the public. 48

Fed. Reg. 23688 (May 26, 1983). In September and October 1983, the comments

were reviewed. The Working Group prepared numerous modifications in the draft

based on comments from the public and from within the Department of Defense,

and on judicial decisions and other developments since completion of the draft.

In October 1983, the Joint-Service Committee approved the draft for forwarding

to the General Counsel, Department of Defense, for submission to the President

after coordination by the Office of Management and Budget. 

 On

November 18, 1983, Congress passed the Military Justice Act of 1983. This

act was signed into law by the President on December 6, 1983, Pub. L. No.

98-209, 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The Working Group had previously drafted

proposed modifications to the May 1983 draft which would be necessary to implement

 the act. These proposed modifications were approved by the Joint-Service

Committee in November 1983 and were made available to the public for comment

in December 1983. 48 Fed. Reg. 54263 (December 1, 1983). These comments were

reviewed and modifications made in the draft by the Working Group, and the

Joint-Service Committee approved these changes in January 1984. The draft

of the complete Manual and the proposed executive order were forwarded to

the General Counsel, Department of Defense in January 1984. These were reviewed

and forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget in January 1984. They

were reviewed in the Departments of Justice and Transportation. The Executive

Order was finally prepared for submission to the President, and the President

 signed it on 13 April 1984.

_Composition of the Manual for Courts-Martial

(1984)_ 

### a. Executive Order (1983).

 The Executive Order includes the Manual for Courts-Martial,

which consists of the Preamble, Rules for Courts-Martial, Military Rules

of Evidence, the Punitive Articles, and Nonjudicial Punishment Procedure.

 Each rule states binding requirements except when the text of the rule expressly

provides otherwise. Normally, failure to comply with a rule constitutes error. _

See_ Article 59 concerning the effect of errors. 

### b. Supplementary Materials

 As a supplement to the Manual, the Department of Defense,

in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security, has published a Discussion

(accompanying the Preamble, the Rules for Courts-Martial, and the Punitive

Articles), this Analysis, and various Appendices. 

#### (1) The Discussion

 

 The Discussion is intended by the drafters to serve

as a treatise. To the extent that the Discussion uses terms such as "must"

or "will", it is solely for the purpose of alerting the user

to important legal consequences that may result from binding requirements

in the Executive Order, judicial decisions, or other sources of binding law.

The Discussion itself, however, does not have the force of law, even though

it may describe legal requirements derived from other sources. It is in the

nature of treatise, and may be used as secondary authority. The inclusion

of both the President's rules and the drafters' informal discussion in the

basic text of the Manual provides flexibility not available in previous editions

of the Manual, and should eliminate questions as to whether an item is a

requirement or only guidance. _See e.g., United States v. Baker_,

14 M.J. 361, 373 (C.M.A. 1973). In this Manual, if matter is included in a

rule or paragraph, it is intended that the matter be binding, unless it is

clearly expressed as precatory. A rule is binding even if the source of the

requirement is a judicial decision or a statute not directly applicable to

 courts-martial. If the President had adopted a rule based on a judicial decision

or a statute, subsequent repeal of the statute or reversal of the judicial

decision does not repeal the rule. On the other hand, if the drafters did

not choose to "codify" a principle or requirement derived from

a judicial decision or other source of law, but considered it sufficiently

significant that users should be aware of it in the Manual, such matter is

 addressed in the Discussion. The Discussion will be revised from time to

time as warranted by changes in applicable law. 

#### (2) The Analysis

 The Analysis sets forth the nonbinding views of the

drafters as to the basis for each rule or paragraph, as well as the intent

of the drafters, particularly with respect to the purpose of substantial changes

 in present law. The Analysis is intended to be a guide in interpretation.

In that regard, note that the Analysis accompanied the project from the initial

drafting stage through submission to the President, and was continually revised

to reflect changes prior to submission to the President. Users are reminded,

however, that primary reliance should be placed on the plain words of the

rules. In addition, it is important to remember that the Analysis solely

represents the views of staff personnel who worked on the project, and does

not necessarily reflect the views of the President in approving it, or of

the officials who formally recommended approval to the President. 

 The

Analysis frequently refers to judicial decisions and statutes from the civilian

sector that are not applicable directly to courts-martial. Subsequent modification

of such sources of law may provide useful guidance in interpreting rules,

and the drafters do not intend that citation of a source in this Analysis

 should preclude reference to subsequent developments for purposes of interpretation.

At the same time, the user is reminded that the amendment of the Manual is

the province of the President. Developments in the civilian sector that affect

the underlying rationale for a rule do not affect the validity of the rule

except to the extent otherwise required as a matter of statutory or constitutional

law. The same is true with respect to rules derived from the decisions of

military tribunals. Once incorporated into the Executive Order, such matters

 have an independent source of authority and are not dependent upon continued

support from the judiciary. Conversely, to the extent that judicial precedent

is set forth only in the Discussion or is otherwise omitted from the Rules

or the Discussion, the continuing validity of the precedent will depend on

the force of its rationale, the doctrine of _stare decisis_,

and similar jurisprudential considerations. Nothing in this Introduction

should be interpreted to suggest that the placement of matter in the Discussion

(or the Analysis), rather than the rule, is to be taken as disapproval of

the precedent or as an invitation for a court to take a different approach;

rather, the difficult drafting problem of choosing between a codification

and common law approach to the law frequently resulted in noncodification

of decisions which had the unanimous support of the drafters. To the extent

that future changes are made in the Rules or Discussion, corresponding materials

will be included in the Analysis.

 The Appendices contain various nonbinding materials to assist users of this Manual. The Appendices also contain excerpts from pertinent statutes. These excerpts are appropriated for judicial notice of law, _see_ Mil. R. Evid. 201A, but nothing

herein precludes a party from proving a change in law through production

of an official codification or other appropriate evidence.

# RULES FOR COURTS-MARTIAL

# CHAPTER CHAPTER I. GENERAL PROVISIONS

## Rule 101. Scope

### (a) In general.

This subsection is patterned after Fed. R. Crim. P. 1. "Courts-martial"

are classified by Article 16. Supplementary procedures include all procedures

directly relating to the court-martial process, such as preparation and authentication

of the record, vacation proceedings, preparation of orders, and professional

 supervision of counsel and military judges. The rules do not govern imposition

of nonjudicial punishment (_see_ Part V) or administrative

actions. 

### (b) Title.

This subsection is patterned after Fed. R. Crim. P. 60. 

## Rule 102. Purpose and construction

This rule restates Fed. R. Crim. P. 2 in terms strictly limiting

the application of these rules to military justice._ Accord_,

Mil. R. Evid. 102. 

## Rule 103. Definitions

The drafters have, whenever possible, followed the definitions used

in the United States Code. _See_ subsection (20). Some definitions

have been made and followed for convenience, to avoid frequent repetition

of complicated phases. Others have been made to address variations in the

terminology used among the services. The drafters have attempted to minimize

the number of definitions. It is the drafters' intent that the words of the

Manual be construed in accordance with their plain meaning, with due deference

 to previous usage of terms in military law or custom. 

### (1) "Article."

This definition was added to reduce repetitive citations to the

Uniform Code of Military Justice. MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and its predecessors used

the same convention. 

### (2) "Capital case."

This definition is based on the first two sentences of paragraph

15 _a_ (3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _2005 Amendment_:  The definition was amended to provide consistently with the contemporaneous amendment to R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(A)(iii)(b), which altered the default referral position for capital cases.

### (3) "Capital offense."

This definition is based on the first sentence of paragraph 15 _

a_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev). 

### (4) "Code."

This definition was added to avoid frequent repetition of "Uniform

Code of Military Justice." 

### (5) "Commander."

This definition was added to avoid frequent repetition of the longer

phrase, "commanding officer or officer in charge." _See

_ Articles 1(3) and (4). 

### (6) "Convening authority."

This provision is based on paragraph 84_a_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). 

### (7) "Copy."

This definition was added to ensure that no construction of the

Manual could result in delays of cases for the sake of unavailable specialized

forms or office equipment. 

### (8) "Court-martial."

Articles 16 and 39(a). 

### (9) "Days."

This definition is added for clarity. _Cf. United States

v. Manalo_, 1 M.J. 452 (C.M.A. 1976). 

### (10) "Detail."

DoD Dir. 5550.7, Incl. 1, para. C.8 (Sep. 28, 1966). 

### (11) "Explosive."

18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 232(5); 844(j). 

### (12) "Firearm."

18 U.S.C. &sect; 232(4). 

### (13) "Joint."

This definition is based on Joint Chiefs of Staff Publication 1,

Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms 187 (1 Jun 79). 

### (14) "Members."

This term is defined to avoid confusion about the membership of

courts-martial. 

### (15) "Military judge."

Article 1 (10). As to presidents of special courts-martial, _

see_ Mil. R. Evid. 101(c). The latter aspect was added for convenience

and brevity in drafting. 

### (16) "Party."

This definition was required by adoption of the texts of federal

civilian rules, which frequently use the term. The code uses the same term. _

See e.g._, Article 49. The Military Rules of Evidence also use the

term. 

### (17) "Staff judge advocate."

This term was not defined in the previous Manuals. It is defined

to avoid variations in nomenclature among the services. 

### (18) "_sua sponte_."

"_sua sponte_" has been used frequently

to avoid gender-specific language ("on his or her own motion").

Its use has been limited to passages expected to be used mainly by lawyers

or with their assistance. Nonetheless, a definition is necessary for the benefit

of a president of a special court-martial without a military judge. 

### (19) "War, time of."

This definition applies only to R.C.M.1004(c)(6) and to Parts IV

and V of the Manual. Parts II (except for R.C.M. 1004(c)(6)) and III do not

use or refer to "time of war." The phrase appears in several

articles of the code, other than punitive articles. _See_ Articles

2(a)(10); 43(a), (e), and (f); 71(b). The discussions of several rules address

"time of war" in relation to these articles. _See_

R.C.M. 202(a) Discussion (4); 407(b) Discussion; 907(b)(2)(B) Discussion. 

 

"Time of war" is used in six punitive articles. _See_ Articles

101, 105, and 106 (which define offenses that can occur only in time of war-Articles

101 and 106 are capital offenses), and Articles 85, 90, and 113 (which are

capital offenses in time of war). _See also_ Article 82. In

 addition, three offenses in Part IV use time of war as an aggravating circumstance. _

See_ paragraphs 37, 40, and 104. 

 The code does not define

"time of war," and Congress has not generally defined the term

 elsewhere, despite the appearance of "time of war" and similar

language in many statutes. _ See e.g._, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3287;

37 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 301(d); 301a(c), 301(a). In at least one instance

Congress has expressly qualified the phrase "time of war" by

saying "time of war declared by Congress." 37 U.S.C. &sect; 310(a). _

Compare_ 37 U.S.C. &sect; 310(a) _ with_ 37

U.S.C. &sect; 301(d); 301a(c). _See also_ S.Rep. No.

 544, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1965) which equates "all out war"

to a declared war.

 The legislative history of the code contains

few references to this matter. The only direct reference, relating to the

deletion of the phrase from Article 102, indicates that the working group

which initially drafted the code considered "time of war" to

mean "a formal state of war." _Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before

a Subcomm. of the House of Comm. on Armed Services_, 81st Cong.,

1st Sess. 1228-29 (1949). This reference is not cited in any of the

decisions of the Court of Military Appeals construing "time of war." 

 Judicial

decisions before the code had long recognized that a state of war may exist

without a declaration of war. _See Bas. v. Tingy_, 4 U.S.

(4 Dall.) 37 (1800); _Hamilton v. M'Claughry_, 136 F. 445

(10th Cir. 1905). _See also United States v. Ayers_, 4 U.S.C.M.A.

220, 15 C.M.R. 220 (1954) and cases cited therein, W. Winthrop, _

Military Law and Precedents_ 668 (2d ed. 1920 reprint)._

See generally_ Carnahan, _The Law of War in the United States

Court of Military Appeals_, 22 A.F.L. Rev. 120 (1980-81); Stevens,_

Time of War and Vietnam_, 8 A.F.JAGL.Rev. 23 (May-June 1966). 

 The

Court of Military Appeals has held that time of war, as used in several provisions

of the code, does not necessarily mean declared war. Under the court's analysis,

whether a time of war exists depends on the purpose of the specific article

in which the phrase appears, and on the circumstances surrounding application

 of that article. _See United States v. Averette_, 19 U.S.C.M.A.

 363, 41 C.M.R. 363 (1970) ("time of war" under Article 2(a)(10)

means declared war; court-martial jurisdiction over civilians is to be construed

narrowly); _United States v. Anderson_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 558,

38 C.M.R. 386 (1968) (Vietnam war was time of war for purpose of suspension

of statute of limitations under Article 43(a)); _ accord Broussard

v. Patton_, 466 F.2d 816 (9th Cir. 1972)); _ United States

v. Anderten_, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 354, 15 C.M.R. 354 (1954) (Korean war

was time of war for purpose of Article 85); _United States v. Taylor

_, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 232, 15 C.M.R. 232 (1954) (Korean war was time of

war for purpose of suspension of statue of limitations under Article 43(f)); _

United States v. Ayers, supra_ (Korea war was time of war for purpose

of suspension of statute of limitations under Article 43(a)); _United

States v. Christensen_, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 22, 15 C.M.R. 22 (1954) (Korean

war was time of war for purpose of Article 90); _ United States v.

 Bancroft_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 3. 11 C.M.R. 3 (1953) (Korean war was time

of war for purpose of Article 113). 

 The circumstances the Court

of Military Appeals has examined to determine whether time of war exists

 include: the nature of the conflict (generally, there must exist "armed

 hostilities against an organized enemy;" _United States v.

Shell_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 646, 650, 23 C.M.R. 110, 114 (1957)); the movement

 to and numbers of United States forces in, the combat area; the casualties

 involved and the sacrifices required; the maintenance of large numbers of

active duty personnel; legislation by Congress recognizing or providing for

the hostilities; executive orders and proclamations concerning the hostilities;

 and expenditures in the war effort. _See United States v. Bancroft,

supra_ at 5, 11 C.M.R. at 5. _See also United States v. Anderson,

supra; United States v. Shell, supra; United States v. Sanders_,

7 U.S.C.M.A. 21, 21 C.M.R. 147 (1956);_United States v. Ayers, supra

_. 

 During the Korean war it was suggested that "time

of war" existed only in the Far Eastern theater. The court did not

have to decide this issue with respect to whether the death penalty was authorized

for Articles 85, 90, or 113 because the President suspended the Table of

Maximum Punishments (paragraph 117c of MCM (Army), 1949; paragraph 127c

of MCM, 1951), only in the Far Eastern command. _See_ Exec.

Order No. 10149, 3 C.F.R. 1949-53 Comp. 326 (1950); Exec. Order No.

10247, 3 C.F.R. 1949-53 Comp. 754 (1951). _See also United States

v. Greco_, 36 C.M.R. 559 (A.B.R. 1965). The question as to Articles

85, 90, or 113 did not arise during the Vietnam war because the Table of

Maximum Punishments was not suspended. There are no reported cases concerning

Articles 101 and 106, and the only prosecutions under Article 105 were, of

course, for offenses arising in the theater of operations. _ See,

e.g., United States v. Dickenson_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 438, 20 C.M.R. 154

(1955);_ United States v. Gallagher_, 23 C.M.R. 591 (A.B.R.

1957). 

 The Court of Military Appeals rejected the argument that

 "time of war" is geographically limited with respect to Article

43. _See United States v. Taylor, supra; United States v. Ayers, supra.

See also United States v. Anderson, supra._ The court's analysis

in _Taylor_ and _Ayers_ suggests, however,

that for some purposes "time of war" may be geographically

limited. For purposes of the death penalty, the prerequisite findings of

aggravating circumstances under R.C.M. 1004 would screen out offenses which

did not substantially affect the war effort. Therefore, possible geographic

limitations in "time of war" would be subsumed in the necessary

findings under R.C.M. 1004. 

 Based on the foregoing, for at least

some purposes of the punitive articles, "time of war" may exist

without a declaration of war. The most obvious example would be a major attack

on the United States and the following period during which Congress may be

unable to meet. _Cf. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Bennion_,

158 F.2d 260 (10th Cir. 1946), _cert, denied_, 331 U.S. 811

 (1947). Moreover, as both the Korean and Vietnam conflicts demonstrated,

United States forces may be committed to combat of substantial proportions

and for extended periods, while for many possible reasons (_see Bas

v. Tingy, supra at 44_) war is not formally declared. 

 It

should be noted that, under the article-by-article analysis used by the Court

of Military Appeals to determine whether time of war exists, "time

of war" as used in Article 106 may be narrower than in other punitive

articles, at least in its application to civilians. _See United States

v. Averette, supra. See also_ Article 104. 

 The definition

does not purport to give the President power to declare war. _See

United States v. Ayers, supra_ at 227, 15 C.M.R. at 227; _

United States v. Bancroft, supra_ at 5, 11 C.M.R. at 5. Instead,

it provides a mechanism by which the President may recognize, for purposes

of removing or specifically raising the maximum limits on punishments for

certain offenses under Part IV, that a "time of war" exists.

 This determination would be based on the existing circumstances. For purposes

 of codal provisions triggered by "time of war," this determination

would be subject to judicial review to ensure it is consistent with congressional

intent. _Cf. United States v. Bancroft, supra._ Nevertheless,

a determination by the President that time of war exists for these purposes

would be entitled to great weight. 

 Paragraph 127c(5) of MCM,

1969 (Rev.) and the ninth paragraph 127c of MCM, 1951 provided for suspension

of the Table of Maximum Punishments as to certain articles upon a declaration

of war. The President could, and did in the Korean war, suspend the limits

the President had established for those offenses. Thus, the effect of the

definition of "time of war" in R.C.M. 103(19) is similar to the

operation of those paragraphs. In either case, a declaration of war or specific

action by the President affects the maximum punishments. The definition

under R.C.M. 103(19) also provides guidance, subject to judicial review

as noted above, on the application of codal provisions. 

(20) "_Writing_."  Subsection (20) was added in 2008 to include electronic recording and other electronic media within the definition of "writing."

(21) "The definitions and rules of construction in 1 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1

through 5 and in 10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 101 and 801." Self-explanatory.

 _

1990 Amendment:_ The change to the discussion corrects a previous

typographical omission of clause (20) and misplacement of definitions of

rank and rating. The note following clause (19) is not part of the definitions

of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 101 and was added to clarify usage of the terms

"rank" and "grade" in this Manual.

 _1998 Amendment:_ The Discussion was amended to include new definitions

of "classified information" in (14) and "national security"

in (15). They are identical to those used in the Classified Information

Procedures Act (18 U.S.C. App. III &sect; 1, _ et. seq._).

 They were added in connection with the change to Article 62(a)(1) (Appeals

Relating to Disclosure of Classified Information). _See_ R.C.M.

908 (Appeal by the United States) and Mil. R. Evid. 505 (Classified Information).

 _2006 Amendment._  10 U.S.C. &sect; 801 was amended to delete the term "law specialist" in 801(11); to change the definition of Judge Advocate in 801(13)(C) to "a commissioned officer of the Coast Guard designated for special duty (law);" and to change the definition of Coast Guard TJAG as "an official designated to serve as Judge Advocate General of the Coast Guard by the Secretary of Homeland Security."  Public Law 109-241, title II, &sect; 218(a)(1), July 11, 2006, 120 Stat. 256.  The text of 801(11) was stricken but subsequent paragraphs were not renumbered.  A note was added to explain that the Secretary of Homeland Security has designated the Chief Counsel, U.S. Coast Guard, to serve as the Judge Advocate General of the Coast Guard.

 _2008 Amendment._ Subsection (20) was renumbered in 2008 to become subsection (21) to allow for the alphabetical insertion of the word "writing."  No substantive change to this subparagraph was intended.

## Rule 104. Unlawful command influence

This rule based on Article 37 and paragraph 38 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also United States v. Charette_, 15 M.J. 197 (C.M.A. 1983); _

United States v. Blaylock_, 15 M.J. 190 (C.M.A. 1983); _United

States v. Ledbetter_, 2 M.J. 37 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States

v. DuBay_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 147, 37 C.M.R. 411 (1967); _United

States v. Wright_, 17 U.S.M.A. 110, 37 C.M.R. 374 (1967); _

United States v. Hawthorne_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 293, 22 C.M.R. 83 (1956).

The discussion is based on H.R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1949).

As to supervision of military judges and counsel, _see_ Articles

6, 26, and 27. Subsection (b)(2)(B) is retained. It is rare that a military

judge in a special court-martial is not assigned to the judicial agency or

activity of the service concerned. _See e.g._, AR 27-10,

 para. 8-6b (3) (Nov. 1982). Subsection (b)(2)(B) ensures that in the

 unusual situation that it is necessary to detail a military judge not so

assigned, the military judge's performance of judicial duties will not be

the subject of comment or evaluation in an efficiency or fitness report prepared

or reviewed by the convening authority. The second sentence in subsection

(b)(2)(B) clarifies that the convening authority may comment only on the

military judge's nonjudicial duties in such a report. Subsection (D) is new

and clarifies that the military judge, members, and counsel are not immune

from action for any offense they might commit while in that capacity, e.g.

failure to repair. 

## Rule 105. Direct communications: convening authorities and staff judge advocates;

 among staff judge advocates

This rule, while new to the Manual for Courts-Martial, is based

on Article 6(b). Congress intended that Article 6(b) serve several purposes.

First, by requiring convening authorities to communicate directly with their

staff judge advocates on matters relating to the administration of military

justice, it was intended that the position and effectiveness of the staff

judge advocate be enhanced. Second, by providing for communications among

judge advocates, it was intended to emphasize the independence of staff judge

 advocates, which in turn would ensure that staff judge advocates exercise

their judicial functions in a fair and objective manner. Lastly, and most

importantly, Article 6(b) was intended to help prevent interference with

the due administration of military justice. _See_ H.R. Rep.

No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 12-13 (1949); S.Rep. 486, 81st Cong.,

1st Sess.9 (1949); 95 Cong. Rec.H. 5721 (1949); 96 Cong. Rec.S 1356 (1950). _

See also Cooke v. Orser_, 12 M.J. 335 (C.M.A. 1982); _United

States v. Davis_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 170, 39 C.M.R. 170 (1969); _

United States v. Walsh_, 11 M.J. 858 (N.M.C.M.R. 1981). 

## Rule 106. Delivery of military offenders to civilian authorities

This rule is based on Article 14(a) and on the second paragraph

of paragraph 12 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _ See also United States v. Reed

_, 2 M.J. 64 (C.M.A. 1976) (delivery and speedy trial); 18 U.S.C.

Appendix II. The second sentence is new. It provides express authority for

restraining an offender to be delivered to civilian authorities, but only

when such restraint is justified under the circumstances. Note that this

rule does not apply to delivery to a foreign government; this situation ordinarily

 is governed by status of forces agreements. This rule applies to delivery

to authorities of the United States or its political subdivisions. Occasionally

when civilian authorities request delivery of a servicemember, the delivery

cannot be effected immediately, e.g., when the offender is overseas. In such

situations, reasonable restraint may be necessary to ensure that the delivery

can be effected and to protect the community. The person responsible for

deciding whether to relinquish the offender must decide whether there are

adequate grounds for restraint in such cases. This rule is not intended to

permit the military to restrain an offender on behalf of civilian authorities

pending trial or other disposition. Restraint imposed under this rule is

strictly limited to the time reasonably necessary to effect the delivery.

Thus, if the civilian authorities are dilatory in taking custody, the restraint

must cease. 

 The discussion is based on Article 14(b). 

## Rule 107. Dismissed officer's right to request trial by court-martial

This rule is based on Article 4 and paragraph 111 of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). _See also_ H.R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.

12 (1949); W. Winthrop,_ Military Law and Precedents_ 64 (2d

ed. 1920 reprint). The text of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1161(a) is as follows:

(a) No commissioned officer may be dismissed from any armed force except-

(1)  by sentence of a general court-martial;

(2)  in communication of a sentence of a general court-martial;

 or

(3)  in time of war, by order of the President.

## Rule 108. Rules of court

This rule is new and is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 57(a) and Article

 140. _Cf._ Article 66(f). _See also United States v.

 Kelson_, 3 M.J. 139 (C.M.A. 1977).  Depending on the regulations,

rules of court may be promulgated on a service-wide, judicial circuit, or

trial judge level, or a combination thereof. The rule recognizes that differences

in organization and operations of services and regional and local conditions

may necessitate variations in practices and procedures to supplement those

 prescribed by the code and this Manual. 

 The manner in which rules

of court are disseminated is within the sole discretion of the Judge Advocate

 General concerned. Service-wide rules, for example, may be published in the

 same manner as regulations or specialized pamphlets or journals. Local rules

may be published in the same manner as local regulations or other publications,

for example. Parties to any court-martial are entitled to a copy, without

cost, of any rules pertaining thereto. Members of the public may obtain copies

under rules of the military department concerned. The penultimate sentence

ensures that failure to publish in accordance with the rules of the Judge

 Advocate General (or a delegate) will not affect the validity of a rule if

a person has actual and timely notice or if there is no prejudice within

the meaning of Article 59. _ Cf._ 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552(a)(1).

## Rule 109. Professional supervision of military judges and counsel

This rule is based on paragraph 43 of MCM, 1969, (Rev.). _

See also_ Articles 1(13), 6(a), 26, and 27. The previous rule was

limited to conduct of counsel in courts-martial. This rule also applies to

 military trial and appellate judges and to all judge advocates and other

 lawyers who practice in military justice, including the administration of

nonjudicial punishment and pretrial and posttrial matters relating to courts-martial.

 The rule also applies to civilian lawyers so engaged, as did its predecessor.

 The rule does not apply to lay persons. Nothing in this rule is intended

to prevent a military judge from excluding, in a particular case, a counsel

from representing a party before the court-martial over which the military

judge is presiding, on grounds of lack of qualifications under R.C.M. 502(d),

or to otherwise exercise control over counsel in accordance with these rules. _

See e.g._, R.C.M. 801. 

 _1993 Amendment:_ Subsection

(a) was amended to conform with subsection (c). The amendment to subsection

(a) clarifies that the Judge Advocates General are responsible for the supervision

and discipline of judges and attorneys. The amendment to subsection (a) is

not intended to limit the authority of a Judge Advocate General in any way. 

 New

subsection (c) is based on Article 6a, Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Article 6a, U.C.M.J. was enacted by the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

Year 1990.  "Military Appellate Procedures," Tit. XIII, &sect; 1303,

National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-189,

 103 Stat. 1352, 1576 (1989). The legislative history reveals Congressional

intent that, to the extent consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

the procedures to investigate and dispose of allegations concerning judges

in the military should emulate those procedures found in the civilian sector. _

See_ H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 331, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 656 (1989)

[hereinafter Conf. Rep. No. 331]. The procedures established

by subsection (c) are largely patterned after the pertinent sections of

the American Bar Association's Model Standards Relating to Judicial Discipline

and Disability Retirement (1978) [hereinafter ABA Model Standard]

and the procedures dealing with the investigation of complaints against

federal judges in 28 U.S.C. &sect; 372 (1988). The rule recognizes,

however, the overall responsibility of the Judge Advocates General for the

certification, assignment, professional supervision, and discipline of military

trial and appellate military judges. _See_ Articles 6, 26

& 66, Uniform Code of Military Justice. 

 Subsection (c)(2)

is based on the committee report accompanying the FY 90 Defense Authorization

Act. _See_ Conf. Rep. No. 331 at 658. This subsection is designed

to increase public confidence in the military justice system while contributing

to the integrity of the system. _See Landmark Communications v.

Virginia_, 435 U.S. 829 (1978). 

 The first sentence of

the Discussion to subsection (c)(2) is based on the committee report accompanying

the Defense Authorization Act. Conf. Rep. No. 331 at 358. The second and

third sentences of the discussion are based on the commentary to ABA Model

Standard 3.4. _ See also, Chandler v. Judicial Council_, 398

U.S. 74 (1970). 

 Subsection (c)(3), (c)(5), and (c)(7) reflect,

and adapt to the conditions of military practice, the general principle

that judges should investigate judges. 

 The first paragraph of

the Discussion to subsection (c)(3) is based on the commentary to ABA Model

Standard 4.1. 

 The discussion to subsection (c)(4) is based on

the commentary to ABA Model Standard 4.6. 

 The clear and convincing

standard found in subsection (c)(6)(c) is based on ABA Model Standard 7.10. 

 Under

subsection (c)(7), the principle purpose of the commission is to advise the

Judge Advocate General concerned as to whether the allegations contained

in a complaint constitute a violation of applicable ethical standards. This

subsection is not intended to preclude use of the commission for other functions

such as rendering advisory opinions on ethical questions. _See_ ABA

Model Standard 9 on the establishment and role of an advisory committee. 

 Subsection

(c)(7)(a) is based on ABA Model Standard 2.3, which provides that one-third

of the members of a commission should be active or retired judges. 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER II. JURISDICTION

## Rule 201. Jurisdiction in general

 _Introduction._ The primary source of court-martial

jurisdiction is Art. I, sec. 8, cl. 14 of the Constitution, which empowers

Congress to make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces

of the United States. Courts-martial are recognized in the provisions of

the fifth amendment expressly exempting "cases arising in the land

or naval forces" from the requirement of presentment and indictment

 by grand jury. _See also_ Part I, Preamble, for a fuller

discussion of the nature of courts-martial and the sources of their jurisdiction.

### (a) Nature of court-martial jurisdiction.

Subsection (1) reiterates the first sentence of the second paragraph

 of paragraph 8 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on paragraph

8 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _ Cf._ Fed R. Crim. P. 7(c)(2); 18 U.S.C.

 &sect;&sect; 3611-20. Courts-martial generally have the power

to resolve issues which arise in connection with litigating criminal liability

and punishment for offenses, to the extent that such resolution is necessary

to a disposition of the issue of criminal liability or punishment. 

 Subsection

(2) restates the worldwide extent of court-martial jurisdiction. Article

5. _See Autry v. Hyde_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 433, 42 C.M.R. 35 (1970).

The discussion points out that, despite the worldwide applicability of the

code, geographical considerations may affect court-martial jurisdiction. _

See_ R.C.M. 202 and 203. 

 Subsection (3) restates the

third paragraph of paragraph 8 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also Chenoweth

v. Van Arsdall_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 183, 46 C.M.R. 183 (1973), which

held that Art. III, sec, 2, cl. 3 of the Constitution (requiring crimes to

be tried in the state in which committed) does not apply to courts-martial.

 The second sentence is based on Article 18. _See also Geneva Convention

Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War_,

August 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3516, T.I.A.S. No. 3365. 

### (b) Requisites of court-martial jurisdiction.

This rule is derived from the fourth paragraph of paragraph 8 of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The first sentence in the rule is new. _See Rosado

v. Wyman_, 397 U.S. 397, 404 n.3 (1970); _Wickham v. Hall

_, 12 M.J. 145, 152 n.8 (C.M.A. 1981). _Cf. Ex parte Poresky

_, 290 U.S. 30 (1933). The rule expands the list of requisites for

court-martial jurisdiction to conform more accurately to practice and case

law. Requisite (3) has been added to reflect the distinction, long recognized

in military justice, between creating a court-martial by convening it, and

extending to a court-martial the power to resolve certain issues by referring

charges to it. Thus, a court-martial has power to dispose only of those offenses

which a convening authority has referred to it. Not all defects in a referral

are jurisdictional. _See United States v. Blaylock_, 15 M.J.

190  (C.M.A. 1983). Requisite (5) is listed separately for the first time.

This requisite makes clear that courts-martial have the power to hear only

those cases which they are authorized by the code to try (i.e., offenses

made punishable by the code, and, in the case of general courts-martial,

certain offenses under the law of war). Second, it recognizes the important

effect of _O'Callahan v. Parker_, 395 U.S. 258 (1969),

on courts-martial. Although nothing in this rule or R.C.M. 203 is intended

 to codify the service-connection requirement of _O'Callahan_ or

 later decisions, the requirement cannot be ignored in the Manual for Courts-Martial. 

 Requisites

(1) and (2) restate two requisites in paragraph 8 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See Generally United States v. Ryan_, 5 M.J. 97 (C.M.A. 1978); _

United States v. Newcomb_, 5 M.J. 4 (C.M.A. 1978). Contrary to the

holdings in _Ryan_ and_ Newcomb_, "errors

in the assignment or excusal of counsel, members, or a military judge that

do not affect the required composition of a court-martial will be tested

solely for prejudice under Article 59." S.Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong.,

1st Sess. 12 (1983). The second sentence of subsection (2) makes this clear,

and also emphasizes that counsel is not a jurisdictional component of a

court-martial. _See Wright v. United States_, 2 M.J. 9 (C.M.A.

1976). Requisite (4) is somewhat broader than the statement in MCM, 1969

(Rev.), since jurisdiction over the person has been affected by judicial

 decisions. _See e.g., McElroy v. United States ex. rel. Guagliardo

_, 361 U.S. 281 (1960); _Reid v. Covert_, 354 U.S.

1 (1957); _ United States v. Averette_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 363,

41 C.M.R. 363 (1970). Thus it is misleading to refer solely to the code as

determining whether jurisdiction over the person exists. The discussion restates

the basic principle that the judgment of a court-martial without jurisdiction

is void. 

### (c) Contempt.

This subsection restates Article 48, except for the deletion of

 military commissions and provost courts. These tribunals are also governed

by Article 48, but need to be mentioned in rules pertaining to courts-martial.

### (d) Exclusive and nonexclusive jurisdiction.

Subsection (d) is based on paragraph 12 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Military

 offenses are those, such as unauthorized absence, disrespect, and disobedience,

which have no analog in civilian criminal law. The second paragraph of paragraph

12 is omitted here, as the subject now appears at R.C.M. 106. Concurrent

jurisdiction of courts-martial and domestic tribunals was formerly discussed

separately from concurrent jurisdiction of courts-martial and foreign tribunals.

The present rule treats both at once since, for purposes of the rule, each

situation is treated the same. The differing considerations and legal implications

in the domestic and foreign situations are treated in the discussion. _

See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(c) for a discussion of the former jeopardy

aspects of exercise of jurisdiction by more than one agency or tribunal.

With respect to the exercise of jurisdiction by the United States or a foreign

 government._ Wilson v. Girard_, 354 U.S. 524 (1957), establishes

that the determination of which nation will exercise jurisdiction is not

a right of the accused. 

 The first paragraph in the discussion

reaffirms the policy found in DOD Directive 5525.1, Jan. 22, 1966 (superseded

by DOD Directive 5525.1, Aug. 7, 1979), which is implemented by a triservice

regulation, AR  27-50/SECNAVINST 5820.4E/AFR 110-12, Dec. 1,

1978, that the United States seeks to maximize jurisdiction over its personnel. 

 The

second paragraph in the discussion restates the third paragraph in paragraph

12 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which was based on _The Schooner Exchange

v. McFaddon and Others_, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 116 (1812). _

See also Wilson v. Girard, supra._ 

### (e) Reciprocal jurisdiction.

This subsection is based on Article 17 and paragraph 13 of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). It continues the express presidential authorization for the

exercise of reciprocal jurisdiction and the delegation of authority (Article

140) to the Secretary of Defense to empower commanders of joint commands

or task forces to exercise such power. _See United States v. Hooper

_, 5 U.S.C.M.A. 391, 18 C.M.R. 15 (1955). It also continues the

 guidance in MCM, 1969 (Rev.) concerning the exercise of reciprocal jurisdiction

by commanders other than those empowered under R.C.M. 201(e)(2). The language

is modified to clarify that manifest injury is not limited to a specific

armed force. The subsection adds a clarification at the end of subsection

(3) that a court-martial convened by a commander of a service different from

the accused's is not jurisdictionally defective nor is the service of which

the convening authority is a member an issue in which the accused has a

recognized interest. The rule and its guidance effectuate the congressional

intent that reciprocal jurisdiction ordinarily not be exercised outside of

joint commands or task forces (_Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcommittee

of the House Committee on Armed Services_, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.

 612-615; 957-958 (1949)) and is designed to protect the integrity

of intraservice lines of authority. _See United States v. Hooper,

supra_ (Brosman, J. and Latimer, J., concurring in the result). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) were revised to implement

the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99 - 433, tit. II, &sect; 211(b), 100 Stat. 992. Because commanders

of unified and specified commands (the combatant commands) derive court-martial

 convening authority from Article 22(a)(3), as added by this legislation,

they need not be established as convening authorities in the Manual. 

 Paragraph

(2)(A), which sets forth the authority of the combatant commanders to convene

courts-martial over members of any of the armed forces, is an exercise of

the President's authority under Article 17(a). In paragraph (2)(B), the

first clause is a delegation from the President to the Secretary of Defense

of the President's authority to designate general court-martial convening

 authorities. This provision, which reflects the current Manual, may be used

by the Secretary of Defense to grant general court-martial convening authority

 to commanders of joint commands or joint task forces who are not commanders

of a unified or specified command. The second clause of paragraph 2(b) is

an exercise of the President's authority under Article 17(a). 

 Nothing

in this provision affects the authority of the President or Secretary of

Defense, as superior authorities, to withhold court-martial convening authority

from the combatant commanders in whole or in part.

 _2005 Amendment_:  This rule clarifies that when a service member is tried by a court-martial convened by a combatant or joint commander, the implementing regulations and procedures of the service to which the accused is a member shall apply.

 _2005 Amendment_:  Subsections (e)(2)(B) and (C) were revised to clarify that the reciprocal jurisdiction authority of joint commanders designated in either subsections (A), (B), or (C), is limited.  This limitation is intended to preclude a joint commander from convening courts upon members who are not assigned or attached to a joint command.

 Subsection (4) has been added to avoid possible questions concerning detailing military

judges from different services.

 _2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (e)(4) was amended to clarify that members and counsel from different services may be detailed to a court-martial convened by a combatant or joint commander.

 Subsection (5) restates Article

17(b). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (6) was inserted

in the context of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization

Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-433, tit. II, 100 Stat. 992, to specify the process

 for resolving disagreements when two organizations, at the highest levels

of each, assert competing claims for jurisdiction over an individual case

or class of cases. Under this legislation, the commanders of unified and

 specified commands are authorized to convene courts-martial. At the same

time, the military departments retain authority over all aspects of personnel

administration, including administration of discipline, with respect to all

 persons assigned to joint duty or otherwise assigned to organizations within

 joint commands. In effect, the combatant commands and the military departments

have concurrent jurisdiction over persons assigned to such commands. Under

most circumstances, any issues as to jurisdiction will be resolved between

the military department and the joint command. Paragraph (6) has been added

to provide a means for resolving the matter when the Service Secretary and

the commander of the joint organization cannot reach agreement. _

See_ H.R. Rep. No. 824, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986), at 125. Paragraph

(6) also requires use of the same procedure when there is a disagreement

between two Service Secretaries as to the exercise of reciprocal jurisdiction. 

 Subsection

(7) was added to ensure that the Secretaries of the military departments

retain responsibility for the administration of discipline, including responsibility

 for all persons in their departments assigned to joint duty. 

 Paragraphs

(6) and (7) apply only when the commander is acting solely in his joint capacity

or when he is seeking to assert jurisdiction over a member of a different

armed force. There are various provisions of the Manual addressing the duties

or responsibilities of superior authorities, and it was considered more

useful to establish who may act as a superior authority as a general proposition

rather than to specify in great detail the relationship between joint commanders

and Service Secretaries as to each such matter. Accordingly, when action

is required to be taken by an authority superior to a combatant commander,

the responsibility is given to the Secretary of the Military Department that

includes the armed force of which the accused is a member. This includes

responsibility for acting on matters such as a request for counsel of the

accused's own selection. An exception is expressly set forth in paragraph

(6), however, which specifically provides the procedure for resolving disagreements

as to jurisdiction. The Service Secretary cannot withhold or limit the exercise

of jurisdiction under R.C.M. 504(b) or under Part V (Nonjudicial Punishment

Procedure) by a combatant commander over persons assigned to the joint command.

Such action may be taken, however, by the Secretary of Defense, who may

assign responsibility to the military department or the unified command for

any case or class of cases as he deems appropriate. 

 The amendments

to R.C.M. 201 are designed to govern organizational relationships between

joint commands and military departments over a range of issues, and are not

intended to confer rights on accused servicemembers. These provisions reflect

the President's inherent authority as Commander-in-Chief to prescribe or

 modify the chain of command, his specific authority under Article 17 to

regulate reciprocal jurisdiction, and his authority (and that of the Secretary

of Defense) under 10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 161-65 (as added by the 1986

 legislation) to prescribe or modify the chain of command. 

 To

the extent that a commander of a joint organization is "dual-hatted"

(i.e., simultaneously serving as commander of a joint organization  and

a separate organization within a military department), subsections (6) and

(7) apply only to the actions taken in a joint capacity.

### (f) Types of courts-martial.

The source for subsection (1) is Article 18. This subsection is

 substantially the same as paragraph 14 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), although it

has been reorganized for clarity. Several statements in MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

 concerning punishments by general courts-martial have been placed in the

 discussion. As to the second sentence in subsection (1)(A)(i), _

see also Wickham v. Hall_, 12 M.J. 145 (C.M.A. 1983); _Wickham

v. Hall_, 706 F.2d 713 (5th Cir. 1983).

 The source for

subsection (2) is Article 19. Subsection (2) is based on paragraph 15 of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), although it has been reorganized for clarity. Note that

under subsection (2)(C)(ii) a general court-martial convening authority

may permit a subordinate convening authority to refer a capital offense to

a special court-martial. This is a modification of paragraph 15 _

 a_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which said a general court-martial convening

authority could "cause" a capital offense to be referred to

a special court-martial without specifying whether the convening authority

had to make the referral personally. Subsection (2)(C)(iii) permits the

Secretary concerned to authorize special court-martial convening authorities

to refer capital offense to special courts-martial without first getting

authorization from a general court-martial convening authority. Several

statements in MCM, 1969 (Rev.) have been placed in the discussion.

 _

2002 Amendment:_ Subsections (f)(2)(B)(i) and (f)(2)(B)(ii) were

amended to remove previous limitations and thereby implement the amendment

to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the

National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65,

 113 Stat. 512 (1999). Subject to limitations prescribed by the President,

the amendment increased the jurisdictional maximum punishment at special

 courts-martial to confinement for one year and forfeitures not exceeding

 two-thirds pay per month for one year, vice the previous six-month jurisdictional

limitation.

 As to subsection (3) summary courts-martial are treated

separately in R.C.M. 1301-1306.

 _

2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (1)(A)(iii)(b) was changed to reflect that a convening authority must affirmatively act to refer a capital punishment eligible offense for trial as a capital case.  Changing the default referral position for capital cases is consistent with the federal criminal practice of requiring affirmative steps before a case can be referred as capital, see, e.g., United States Attorneys' Manual, Chapter 9-10.000, as well as the affirmative steps required of the government in order to refer a court-martial as capital.  It also provides a default construct that is applicable to the vast majority of actual capital eligible cases.

 _2015 Amendment_: R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(D) was created to implement Section 1705 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to offenses occurring on or after 24 June 2014. Sec. 1705(c), P.L. 113-66.

### (g) Concurrent jurisdiction of other military tribunals.

This subsection is based on the last paragraph in paragraph 12 of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _2015 Amendment_: The discussion was amended in light of _Solorio v. United States_, 483 U.S. 435 (1987). _O'Callahan v. Parker_, 395 U.S. 258 (1969), held that an offense under the Code could not be tried by court-martial unless the offense was "service connected." _Solorio_ overruled _O'Callahan_. The struck language was inadvertently left in prior revisions of the Manual.

## Rule 202. Persons subject to the jurisdiction of courts-martial

### (a) In general.

This subsection incorporates by reference the provisions of the

code (_see_ Articles 2, 3, 4, and 73) which provide jurisdiction

over the person. _See also_ Articles 83, 104, 106. The discussion

 under this subsection briefly described some of the more important requirements

for court-martial jurisdiction over persons. Standards governing active duty

servicemembers (Article 2(a)(1)) are emphasized, although subsection (4)

brings attention to limitations on jurisdiction over civilians established

 by judicial decisions. 

 Subsection (2)(A) of the discussion dealing

with inception of jurisdiction over commissioned officers, cadets, midshipmen,

warrant officers, and enlisted persons is divided into three parts. The first

part, enlistment, summarizes the area of the law in the wake of the amendment

of Article 2 in 1979. Act of November 9, 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-107,

&sect; 801(a), 93 Stat. 810-11. In essence, the amendment eliminated

 recruiter misconduct as a factor of legal significance in matters involving

 jurisdiction, and reestablished and clarified the "constructive enlistment"

doctrine. The  statutory enlistment standards concerning capacity under

10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 504 and 505 thus become critical, along with

the issue of voluntariness. As to whether an enlistment is compelled or

voluntary,_ compare United States v. Catlow_, 23 U.S.C.M.A.

142, 48 C.M.R. 758 (1974) _with United States v. Wagner_, 5

M.J. 461 (C.M.A. 1978) _and United States v. Lightfoot_, 4

M.J. 262 (C.M.A. 1978). _See also United States v. McDonagh_,

14 M.J. 415 (C.M.A. 1983). 

 The second paragraph under (i)_

Enlistment_ is based on _ United States v. Bean_,

13 U.S.C.M.A. 203, 32 C.M.R. 203 (1962); _United States  v. Overton

_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 684, 26 C.M.R. 464 (1958); and 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1170.

The last sentence is based on Article 2(c) which provides that in case

of constructive enlistment, jurisdiction continues until "terminated

in accordance with law or  regulations promulgated by the Secretary concerned." 

 The

last paragraph restates Article 2(c). The last sentence of that paragraph

takes account of the legislative history of Article 2(c). _See_ S.Rep.

No. 197, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 122 (1979), which indicates that _

United States v. King_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 19, 28 C.M.R. 243 (1959) is

 overruled by the statute. This is also reflected in the first paragraph under

 (ii) _Induction_. 

 The first paragraph of (ii)_

Induction_ is (with the exception of the application of the constructive

enlistment doctrine,_see_ the immediately preceding paragraph)

based on _United States v. Hall_, 17 C.M.A. 88, 37 C.M.R.

352 (1967); _United States v. Rodriguez_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 101,

 6 C.M.R. 101 (1952); _United States v. Ornelas_, 2 U.S.C.M.A.

 96 C.M.R. 96 (1952). _See also Billings v. Truesdell_, 321

U.S. 542 (1944); _Mayborn v. Heflebower_, 145 F.2d 864 (5th

Cir. 1944), _cert. denied_, 325 U.S. 854 (1945). 

 The

second paragraph under (ii) _Induction_ is based on _

United States v. Scheunemann_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 479, 34 C.M.R. 259

(1964). _See also United States v. Wilson_, 44 C.M.R. 891 (A.C.M.R.

 1971). Although no military case has so held, _dicta_ and _

Scheunemann_ supports the second sentence. 

 As to (iii) _

Call to active duty, see_ 10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 672, 673

and 673(a). _See also United States v. Peel_, 4 M.J. 28 (C.M.A.

 1977). The second paragraph  of this section reflects decisions in _

United States v. Barraza_, 5 M.J. 230 (C.M.A. 1978) and _United

States v. Kilbreth_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 390, 47 C.M.R. 327 (1973). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Paragraph (2)(A)(iii) of the Discussion was amended

and paragraph (5) was added to reflect amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of

the UCMJ contained in the "Military Justice Amendment of 1986,"

 tit. VIII, &sect; 804, National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal

 year 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986), which, among

other things, preserves the exercise of jurisdiction over reservists for

offenses committee in a duty status, notwithstanding their release from duty

status, if they have time remaining on their military obligation. The legislation

also provides express statutory authority to order reservists, including

members of the National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard

 of the United States who commit offenses while serving on duty under Title

10 of the United States Code, to active duty for disciplinary action, including

the service of any punishment imposed. 

 The first paragraph under

(B)_Termination of jurisdiction over active duty personnel_

restates the basic rule. _See United States v. Brown_, 12

U.S.C.M.A. 693, 31 C.M.R. 297 (1962); _United States v. Scott_,

11 U.S.C.M.A. 646, 29 C.M.R. 462 (1960). _See also United States

v. Griffin_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 213, 32 C.M.R. 213 (1962). 

 Subsection

(B)(i) is based on _United States v. Wheeley_, 6 M.J. 220

(C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Smith_, 4 M.J. 265 (C.M.A.

1978); _United States v. Hutchins_, 4 M.J. 190 (C.M.A. 1978); _

United States v. Hout_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 299, 41 C.M.R. 299 (1970). _

See also Dickenson v. Davis_, 245 F.2d 317 (10th Cir. 1957). 

 Subsection

(B)(ii) describes what jurisdiction remains under Article 3(a) in light of _

United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles_, 350 U.S. 11 (1955). _

See also United States v. Clardy_, 13 M.J. 308 (C.M.A. 1982). 

 The

exceptions is subsection (B)(iii) are restated in slightly different language

for clarity from paragraph 11 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Exception

(_ b_) is based on _United States v. Clardy, supra.

See also_ 14 M.J. 123 (C.M.A. 1982). As to exception (c), jurisdiction

over prisoners in the custody of the armed forces, _ see Kahn v. Anderson

_, 255 U.S. 1 (1921); _United States v. Nelson_, 14

U.S.C.M.A. 93, 33 C.M.R. 305 (1963). _See also Mosher v. Hunter_,

143 F.2d 745 (10th Cir. 1944), _cert. denied_, 323 U.S.

800 (1945). Although it has not been judicially interpreted, the sentence

of paragraph 11_b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) has been included

here. The principle it expressed has long been  recognized. _See_ the

 last sentence in paragraph 11_b_ of MCM, 1951; the last

sentence of the third paragraph of paragraph 10 of MCM (Army), 1949; and

the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of paragraph 10 of MCM, 1928. As

to jurisdiction under Article 3(b), see _Wickham v. Hall_,

12 M.J. 145 (C.M.A.  1981); _Wickham v. Hall_, 706 F.2d 713

(5th Cir. 1983). 

 Subsection (3) described the jurisdiction under

Article 2(a)(8). _See also_ 33 U.S.C. &sect; 855;

42 U.S.C. &sect; 217. 

 Subsection (4) of the discussion

points out that jurisdiction over civilians has been restricted by judicial

decisions. _See generally Reid v. Covert_, 354 U.S. 1 (1957); _

Toth v. Quarles, supra_. The MCM 1969 (Rev.) referred to such limitations

only in footnotes to Articles 2(a)(10) and (11) and 3(a). The discussion

of R.C.M. 202 is a more appropriate place to bring attention to these matters.

A brief reference in the discussion was considered sufficient, while the

analysis provides primary sources of law in the area, should an issue arise

on the subject. 

 The second sentence in the subsection (4) of discussion

is based on _McElroy v. United States ex rel. Guagliardo_,

361 U.S. 281  (1960); _Grisham v. Hagan_, 361 U.S. 278 (1960); _

Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton_, 361 U.S. 234 (1960); _

Reid v. Covert, supra_. It is not settled whether "peacetime"

as used in these decisions means all times other than a period of declared

war or whether "peacetime" ceases when armed forces are involved

in undeclared wars or hostilities. There is some authority for the latter

view. _See_ W. Winthrop, _Military Law and Precedents,

_ 101 (2d ed. 1920 reprint). 

 With respect to Article

2(a)(10), the Court of Military Appeals has held that "time of war"

 means a formally declared war (based on U.S. Const., art. I, sec. 8, cl.

11). _United States v. Averette_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 363, 41

C.M.R. 363 (1970). _But cf. Latney v. Ignatius_, 416 F.2d

 821 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (assuming without deciding that Article 2(a)(10) could

 be invoked during period of undeclared war, no court-martial jurisdiction

existed over civilian merchant seaman for murder in Vietnam because crime

and accused were not sufficiently connected with the military). _

See also_ Analysis, R.C.M. 103(19). 

 The words "in

the field" and "accompanying an armed force" have also

been judicially construed. "In the field" implies military operations

with a view to the enemy. 14 Ops. Atty Gen. 22 (1872). The question whether

an armed force is "in the field" is not to be determined by the

 locality in which it is found, but rather by the activity in which it is

engaged. _Hines v.  Mikell_, 259 F.28, 34 (4th Cir. 1919).

Thus, forces assembled in the United States for training preparatory for

service in the actual theater of war were held to be "in the field." _

Hines v. Mikell, supra_. A merchant ship and crew transporting troops

and supplies to a battle zone constitute a military expedition "in

the field." _In re Berue_, 54 F. Supp. 252 (S.D. Ohio

1944); _McCune v. Kilpatrick_, 53 F.Supp. 80 (E.D. Va. 1943). _

See also Ex parte Gerlach_, 247 F.616 (S.D.N.Y. 1917); _United

States v. Burney_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 776, 21 C.M.R. 98 (1956); _

Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services

_, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 872-3 (1949). _But see_,

W. Winthrop, _supra_ at 100-102; _Reid v. Covert,

supra_ at 34 n. 61. 

 One may be "accompanying an

armed force" although not directly employed by it or the Government.

For example, an employee of a contractor engaged on a military project or

serving on a merchant ship carrying supplies or troops is "accompanying

an armed force." _Perlstein v. United States_, 151 F.2d

167 (3d Cir. 1945), _cert. dism._, 328 U.S. 822 (1946); _

In re DiBartolo_, 50 F.Supp. 929 (S.D.N.Y. 1943); _In re Berue,

supra; McCune v. Kilpatrick, supra._ To be "accompanying an

armed force" one's presence within a military installation must be

more than merely incidental; it must be connected with or dependent upon

the activities of the armed forces or its personnel. Although a person "accompanying

an armed force" may be "serving with" it as well, the

distinction is important because even though a civilian's contract with the

 Government ended before the commission of an offense, and hence the person

is no longer "serving with" an armed force, jurisdiction may

remain on the ground that the person is "accompanying an armed force"

 because of continued connection with the military. _Perlstein v.

United States, supra; Grewe v. France_, 75 F.Supp. 433 (E.D. Wis.

1948). 

 _McElroy v. Guagliardo, supra_ at 285-87,

 discusses possible methods for extending court-martial jurisdiction over

civilians in some circumstances. To date these methods remain undeveloped. _

See also_ Everett and Hourcle, _Crime Without Punishment-Ex-servicemen,

 Civilian Employees and Dependents_, 13 A.F.JAG L. Rev. 184 (1971).

 Civilians may be tried by general court-martial under Article 18 and the

law of war. _See_ R.C.M.  201(f)(1)(B); 202(b). _See

also_ Article 21. This includes trial by court-martial in places

 where the United States is an occupying power. _See e.g., Madsen

v. Kinsella_, 343 U.S. 341 (1952) [upholding jurisdiction

 of military commission to try a dependent spouse in occupied Germany in

1950. Although a state of war with Germany still technically existed (_

see_ Proclamation No. 2950, 3 C.F.R. (1948-53 Comp.) 135

(1951)) hostilities were declared terminated on 31 December 1946 (_

see_ Proclamation No. 2714, 3 C.F.R. (1948-53 Comp.) 99 (1947))

and the United States Supreme Court observed in dicta that military courts

might have jurisdiction in occupied territory even in peacetime, 343 U.S.

at 360)]. _See also Wilson v. Bohlender_, 361 U.S.

281, 283 n. 2 (1960); _Kinsella v. Singleton, supra_ at 244.

### (b) Offenses under the law of war.

This subsection is based on Article 18. _See also_

Article 21. The phrase "offense subject to trial by court-martial"

or "offense triable by court-martial" is used in the R.C.M.

in recognition of the fact that the Manual for Courts-Martial governs courts-martial

 for offenses under the law of war as well as under the code. _See

 e.g._, R.C.M. 301(b); 302(c); 304(c); 305(d). In such contexts,

the phrase does not include a requirement for a jurisdictional determination.

### (c) Attachment of jurisdiction over the person.

This subsection is based on paragraph 11_d_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.), and states the basic principle that once the jurisdiction of

a court-martial attaches, it continues until the process of trial, appeal,

and punishment is complete. _See generally United States v. Douse

_, 12 M.J. 473 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Sippel_,

4 U.S.C.M.A. 50, 15 C.M.R. 50 (1954). 

 The discussion clarifies

the distinction between the existence of personal jurisdiction and the attachment

of jurisdiction. _Compare United States v. Douse, supra_ at

479 (Everett, C.J., concurring in the result); _United States v. Wheeley

_, 6 M.J. 220 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Hutchins_,

4 M.J. 190 (C.M.A. 1978); and _United States v. Hout, supra_ (opinion

of Quinn, C.J.) _with United States v. Douse, supra_ (opinion

of Cook, J.); _United States v. Smith_, 4 M.J. 265 (C.M.A.

1978); _United States v. Hout, supra_ at 302; 41 C.M.R. 299,

302 (1970) (Darden, J., concurring in the result); and _United States

 v. Rubenstein_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 523, 22 C.M.R. 313 (1957). _

See also_ W. Winthrop, _supra_ at 90-91. 

 Subsection

(2) includes examples of means by which jurisdiction may attach. They are

taken from paragraph 11 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) although "filing

of charges" has been clarified to mean preferral of charges. _

See United States v. Hout, supra._ This list is not exhaustive. _

See United States v. Self_, 13 M.J. 132 (C.M.A. 1982); _United

States v. Douse, supra; United States v. Smith, supra. See also United States

v. Fitzpatrick_, 14 M.J. 394 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States

v. Handy_, 14 M.J. 202 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v.

Wheeley, supra; United States v. Rubenstein, supra; United States v.  Mansbarger

_, 20 C.M.R. 449 (A.B.R. 1955). 

## Rule 203. Jurisdiction over the offense

This rule is intended to provide for the maximum possible court-martial

jurisdiction over offenses. Since the constitutional limits of subject-matter

jurisdiction are matters of judicial interpretation, specific rules are

of limited value and may unnecessarily restrict jurisdiction more than is

 constitutionally required. Specific standards derived from current case

law are treated in the discussion. 

 The discussion begins with

a brief description of the rule under _O'Callahan v. Parker_,

 395 U.S. 258 (1969). It also describes the requirements established in _

 United States v. Alef_, 3 M.J. 414 (C.M.A. 1977) to plead and prove

jurisdiction. _See also_ R.C.M. 907(b)(1)(A). The last three

sentences in subsection (b) of the discussion are based on _United

States v. Lockwood_, 15 M.J. 1 (C.M.A. 1983). The remainder of the

discussion reflects the Working Group's analysis of the application of service-connection

as currently construed in judicial decisions. It is not intended as endorsement

or criticism of that construction. 

 Subsection (c) of the discussion

lists the _Relford_ factors, which are starting points in

service-connection analysis, although the nine additional considerations in

 _Relford_ are also significant. These factors are not exhaustive. _

United States v. Lockwood, supra. See also United States v. Trottier_,

9 M.J. 337 (C.M.A. 1980). _ Relford_ itself establishes the

basis for (c)(2) and (c)(3) of the discussion. It has never been seriously

 contended that purely military offenses are not service-connected per se. _

See Relford_ factor number 12. Decisions uniformly have held that

offenses committed on a military installation are service-connected. _

See, e.g., United States v. Hedlund, supra; United States v. Daniels_,

19 U.S.C.M.A. 529, 42 C.M.R. 131 (1970). _See Relford_ factors

2, 3, 10, and 11. As to the third sentence in (c)(3), _see United

States v. Seivers_, 8 M.J. 63 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States

v. Escobar_, 7 M.J. 197 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Crapo

_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 594, 40 C.M.R. 306 (1969); _Harkcom v. Parker

_, 439 F.2d 265 (3d Cir. 1971). With respect to the fourth sentence

of (c)(3), _see United States v. Hedlund, supra; United States v.

Riehle_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 603, 40 C.M.R. 315 (1969). _But cf.

United States v. Lockwood, supra._ Although much of the reasoning

in _United States v. McCarthy_, 2 M.J. 26 (C.M.A. 1976) has

been repudiated by _United States v. Trottier, supra_, the

holding  of _McCarthy_ still appears to support the penultimate

sentence in (c)(3). _See also United States v. Lockwood, supra; United

States v. Gladue_, 4 M.J. 1 (C.M.A. 1977). The last sentence is

based on _United States v. Lockwood, supra_. 

 The

discussion of drug offenses in (c)(4) is taken from _ United States

v. Trottier, supra._ 

 As to (c)(5), the first sentence

is based on _ United States v. Lockwood, supra_. Whether

the military status of the victim or the accused's use of military identification

card can independently support service-connection is not established by the

holding in _Lockwood_. The second sentence is based on _

United States v. Whatley_, 5 M.J. 39 (C.M.A. 1978); _United

States v. Moore_, 1 M.J. 448 (C.M.A. 1976). The last sentence is

based on _United States  v. Conn, supra; United States v. Borys_,

18 U.S.C.M.A. 547, 40 C.M.R. 259 (1969) (officer status of accused does

not establish service-connection under Article 134) (note: service-connection

of Article 133 offenses has not been judicially determined); _United

States v. Saulter_, 5 M.J. 281 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States

v. Conn, supra_ (fact that accused was military policeman did not

establish service-connection); _United States v. Armes_, 19

U.S.C.M.A. 15, 41 C.M.R. 15 (1969) (wearing uniform during commission of

 offense does not establish service-connection). 

 Subsection (c)(6)

of the discussion indicates that virtually all offenses by servicemembers

in time of declared war are service-connected. There is little case authority

on this point. The issue was apparently not addressed during the conflict

in Vietnam; of course, the overseas exception provided jurisdiction over

offenses committed in the theater of hostilities. The emphasis in _

 O'Callahan_ on the fact that the offenses occurred in peacetime

(_see Relford_ factor number 5) strongly suggests a different

 balance in time of war. Furthermore, in _Warner v. Flemings_,

a companion case  decided with _ Gosa v. Mayden_, 413 U.S.

665 (1973), Justices Douglas and Stewart concurred in the result in upholding

Flemings' court-martial conviction for stealing an automobile while off

post and absent without authority in 1944, on grounds that such an offense,

during a congressionally declared war, is service-connected. The other Justices

 did not reach this question. Assigning _Relford_ factor number

 5 such extensive, indeed controlling, weight during time of declared war

is appropriate in view of the need for broad and clear jurisdictional lines

in such a period. 

 Subsection (d) of the discussion lists recognized

exceptions to the service-connection requirement. The overseas exception

was first recognized in _United States v. Weinstein_, 19 U.S.C.M.A.

29, 41 C.M.R.  29 (1969). _See also United States v. Keaton_,

19 U.S.C.M.A. 64, 41 C.M.R. 64 (1969). The  overseas exception flows from _

O'Callahan's_ basic premise: that the service-connection requirement

is necessary to protect the constitutional right of service members to indictment

by grand jury and trial by jury. While this premise might not be evident

from a reading of _O'Callahan_ alone, the Supreme Court subsequently

confirmed that this was the basis of the _O'Callahan_ rule. _

See Gosa v. Mayden, supra_ at 677. Since normally no civilian court

in which the accused would have those rights is available in the foreign

setting, the service-connection limitation does not apply. 

 The

situs of the offense, not the trial, determines whether the exception may

apply. _United States v. Newvine_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 208, 48 C.M.R.

960 (1974); _United States v. Bowers_, 47 C.M.R. 516 (A.C.M.R.

1973). The last sentence in the discussion of the overseas exception is

based on _United States v. Black_, 1 M.J. 340 (C.M.A. 1976). _

See also United States v. Gladue_, 4 M.J. 1(C.M.A. 1977); _

United States v. Lazzaro_, 2 M.J. 76 (C.M.A. 1976). Some federal

courts have suggested that the existence of court-martial jurisdiction over

an overseas offense does not depend solely on the fact that the offense

is not cognizable in the United States civilian courts. _See Hemphill

 v. Moseley_, 443 F.2d 322 (10th Cir. 1971). _See also United

States v. King_, 6 M.J. 553 (A.C.M.R. 1978), _pet. denied

_, 6 M.J. 290 (1979). 

 Several Federal courts which have

addressed this issue have also held that the foreign situs of a trial is

sufficient to support court-martial jurisdiction, although the rationale

for this result has not been  uniform. _See e.g., Williams v. Froehlke

_, 490 F.2d 998 (2d Cir. 1974); _Wimberly v. Laird_,

472 F.2d 923 (7th Cir.), _cert. denied_, 413  U.S. 921 (1973); _

Gallagher v. United States_, 423 F.2d 1371 (Ct. Cl.), _ cert.

denied_, 400 U.S. 849 (1970); _Bell v. Clark_, 308

F.Supp. 384 (E.D. Va. 1970), _aff'd_, 437 F.2d 200 (4th Cir.

 1971). As several of these decisions recognize, the foreign situs of an

offense is a factor weighing heavily in favor of service-connection even

without an exception for overseas offenses. _See Relford_ factors

4 and 8. The logistical difficulties, the disruptive effect on military activities,

 the delays in disposing of offenses, and the need for an armed force in a

 foreign country to control its own members all militate toward service-connection

for offenses committed abroad. Another consideration, often cited by the

courts, is the likelihood that if the service-connection rule were applied

overseas as it is in the United States, the practical effect would be far

more frequent exercise of jurisdiction by host nations, thus depriving the

 individual of constitutional protections the rule is designed to protect. 

 The

petty offenses exception rests on a similar doctrinal foundation as the overseas

exception. Because there is no constitutional right to indictment by grand

jury or trial by jury for petty offenses (_see Baldwin v. New York

_, 399 U.S. 66 (1970); _Duncan v. Louisiana_, 391 U.S.

145 (1968); _Duke v. United States_, 301 U.S. 492 (1937));

the service-connection requirement does not apply to them. _United

States v. Sharkey_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 26,  41 C.M.R. 26 (1969). _

Under Baldwin v. New York, supra_, a petty offense is one in which

the maximum sentence is six months confinement or less. Any time a punitive

discharge is included in the maximum punishment, the offense is not petty. _

See United States v. Smith_, 9 M.J. 359, 360 n.1 (C.M.A. 1980); _

United States v. Brown_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 333, 32 C.M.R. 333 (1962). 

 _

Sharkey_ relied on the maximum punishment under the table of maximum

punishments in determining whether an offense is petty. It is the view of

the Working Group that offenses tried by summary courts-martial and special

courts-martial at which no punitive discharge may be adjudged are "petty

 offenses" for purposes of _O'Callahan,_ in view of the

 jurisdictional limitations of such courts. Whether the jurisdictional limits

of a summary of such special court-martial makes an offense referred to

such a court-martial petty has not been judicially determined.

 _

1995 Amendment :_ The discussion was amended in light of _

 Solorio v. United States,_ 483 U.S. 435 (1987). _O'Callahan

v. Parker,_ 395 U.S. 258 (1969), held that an offense under the

code could not be tried by court-martial unless the offense was "service

connected." _Solorio_ overruled _O'Callahan._

## Rule 204. Jurisdiction over certain reserve component personnel

 _1987 Amendment:_ R.C.M. 204 and its discussion

were added to implement the amendments to Articles 2 and 3, UCMJ, contained

in the "Military Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII, &sect;

804, National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub. L. No.

99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986). Use of the term "member of a reserve

 component" in Article 3(d) means membership in the reserve component

at the time disciplinary action is initiated. The limitation in subsection

(b)(1) restricting general and special courts-martial to periods of active

 duty is based upon the practical problems associated with conducting a court-martial

only during periods of scheduled inactive-duty training, and ensures that

the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction is consistent with the policies

set forth in Article 2(d). The last sentence of subsection (d) reflects legislative

intent "not to disturb the jurisprudence of _United States ex

rel. Hirshberg v.  Cooke,_ 336 U.S. 210 (1949)" (H.R. Rep.

No. 718, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. at 227 (1986)). 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER III. INITIATION OF CHARGES; APPREHENSION;PRETRIAL RESTRAINT; RELATED MATTERS

## Rule 301. Report of offense

The primary sources of this rule are paragraphs 29 _a_

and 31 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Those provisions were adopted in substance except

that subsection (b) provides that reports be conveyed to the "immediate

commander" of suspects, meaning the "commander exercising immediate

jurisdiction. . . under Article 15." The language was changed because

the previous language was cumbersome and legalistic. There is no corresponding

provision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The most closely analogous

provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is Rule 3 (complaints).

However, "[w]ith respect to the complaint, in general,

it should be noted that its principle purpose is to serve as the basis for

an arrest warrant." J. Moore, _Moore's Federal Practice, Rules

Pamphlet_ (part 3) 10 (1982). That purpose is not the same as the

purpose of R.C.M. 301. R.C.M. 301 is simply to assure that ordinarily information

relating to offenses is conveyed promptly to the suspect's immediate commander.

## Rule 302. Apprehension

### (a) Definition and scope.

The definition of "apprehension" in subsection (1) is

 taken from Article 7(a), as was its predecessor, paragraph 18 _a

_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The peculiar military term "apprehension"

is statutory (Article 7(a)) and cannot be abandoned in favor of the more

conventional civilian term, "arrest." _See generally United

 States v. Kinane,_ 1 M.J. 309 (C.M.A. 1976). _See also United

 States v. Cordero,_ 11 M.J. 210, 217, n.1 (C.M.A. 1981) (Everett,

C.J., concurring). 

 The discussion of "apprehension"

is also consistent with paragraphs 18 _a_ and _b_(1)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion draws a distinction between apprehensions

and detentions. The distinction is based upon the duration of the status,

the legal consequences of the impairment of liberty, and the circumstances

under which the two forms are used. _Brown v. Texas,_ 443 U.S.

47 (1979); _Dunaway v. New York,_ 442 U.S. 200 (1979); _

Terry v. Ohio,_ 392 U.S. 1 (1968); _United States v. Schneider,

_ 14 M.J. 189 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Texidor-Perez,

_ 7 M.J. 356 (C.M.A. 1979). 

 This rule conforms in intent

with the substance of Fed. R. Crim. P. 3 through 5. However, the formal

warrant application process and initial appearance requirement of those rules

 are impracticable, and, given the command control aspects of the military,

unnecessary for military criminal practice. The purposes of Fed. R. Crim.

P. 3 through 5 are achieved by later rules in this chapter. 

 Subsection

(2) clarifies the scope of the rule. It does not affect apprehensions of

persons not subject to trial by court-martial. Apprehension and detention

of such persons by military law enforcement personnel is not part of the

court-martial process; it is based on the commander's inherent authority

to maintain law and order on the installation and on various state laws

concerning citizen's arrest. _See United States v. Banks,_ 539

F.2d 14 (9th Cir. 1976). The rule also does not affect the authority of

persons not listed in subsection (b) to apprehend. The discussion gives some

 examples of such categories. 

### (b) Who may apprehend.

This subsection restates the substance of Articles 7(b) and (c)

and 8, and paragraphs 19a and 23 of MCM, 1969, (Rev.). Subsection (3), Federal

civilian law enforcement officers, is the only new provision. 

 Subsection

(1) is taken from paragraph 19 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

phrase "whether subject to the code or not" is added to the present

rule to make clear that contract civilian guards and police and similar

civilian law enforcement agents of the military have the power to apprehend

persons subject to the code. 

 The discussion of subsection (1)

reflects the elimination of the previous restrictive policy against apprehensions

of commissioned and warrant officers by enlisted and civilian law enforcement

personnel. This recognizes the authority of such personnel commensurate with

their law enforcement duties. The rule does not foreclose secretarial limitations

on the discretion of such personnel. 

 _1987 Amendment:_

The Discussion was amended to clarify that special agents of the Defense

Criminal Investigative Service have the authority to apprehend persons subject

to trial by courts-martial. 

 Subsection (2) restates the previous

exercise of delegated authority under Article 7(b) to designate persons

authorized to apprehend which appeared in the first clause in the first sentence

of paragraph 19 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The accompanying

discussion is based on the second sentence of paragraph 19 _a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _1990 Amendment:_ The words "or

inactive-duty training" were added in conjunction with the enactment

of the "Military Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII, 804

National Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-661,

100 Stat. 3905 (1986) expanding jurisdiction over reserve component personnel. 

 Subsection

(3) restates Article 8. This seemingly duplicative statement is required

because the codal provision as to deserters extends the Federal arrest power

to state and local law enforcement agents who do not have the kind of Federal

arrest power possessed by their colleagues listed in subsection (3). The

fact that a person who apprehended a deserter was not authorized to do so

is not a ground for discharging the deserter from military custody. _

See_ paragraph 23 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (c) Grounds of apprehension.

This subsection concerns apprehension of persons subject to the

code or to trial by court-martial. Note that such persons may be apprehended

under this rule only for offenses subject to trial by court-martial. _

See also_ the analysis of subsection (a)(2) of this rule. The power

to apprehend under this rule lasts as long as the person to be apprehended

is subject to the code or to trial by court-martial. This provision has

no explicit parallel in MCM, 1969 (Rev.) but is consistent with the limitation

of the apprehension power in both the code and that Manual to persons subject

to the code. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure have no similar provision

either, because the arrest power of civilian law enforcement officials is

not similarly limited by the status of the suspect. 

 The subsection

states alternative circumstances which must exist to permit apprehension

during this period. The first two sentences restate the probable cause requirement

for apprehension of suspects, the main use of the apprehension power of

which Article 7(b) and paragraph 19 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

 took note. They are consistent with Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(a). No change to the

 substance of those provisions has been made, but the discussion provides

that probable cause may be based on "the reports of others" to

make clear that hearsay may be relied upon as well as personal knowledge.

This addition is consistent with Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(b). The wording has been

changed to eliminate the legal term, "hearsay." 

 The

last sentence of the subsection restates the codal authority of commissioned,

warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers to use the apprehension power

to quell disorders, and is based on Article 7(c) and paragraph 19 _

b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), changed only as necessary to accommodate

format. _Cf._ paragraph 19 _a_ of MCM, 1951,

and of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) (authority of military law enforcement official

to apprehend on probable cause). _See also_ Article of War

68 (1920). _Compare_ paragraph 20_b_ (authority

of military police) _with_ paragraph 20 _c_ (quarrels

and frays) of MCM (Army), 1949 and of MCM (AF), 1949. Article 7(b) expressly

requires probable cause to believe an offense has been committed; Article

7(c) does not. 

### (d) How an apprehension may be made.

In subsection (1) the general statement of procedure to make an

 apprehension is based on paragraph 19 _c_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

but it has been amplified in accord with _United States v. Kinane,

_ 1 M.J. 309 (C.M.A. 1976). _See also United States v. Sanford,

_ 12 M.J. 170 (C.M.A. 1981). 

 Subsection (2) is consistent

with military law. It is superficially inconsistent with Fed. R. Crim. P.

4, but the inconsistency is more apparent than real. Civilian law enforcement

officials generally have power to arrest without warrant for offenses committed

in their presence and for felonies upon probable cause. _See e.g.

_ 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3052, 3053, and 3056. To restrict the military

apprehension power by requiring warrants in all or most cases would actually

be inconsistent with civilian practice. The problem of apprehensions in

dwellings is addressed by cross-reference to subsection (e) (2). 

 Subsection

(3) clarifies the power of military law enforcement officials to secure the

custody of a person. There is no similar provision in the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure. It is general, leaving to the services ample breadth

in which to make more definitive regulations. 

 The discussion restates

paragraph 19 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). There is no corollary

 provision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The purpose of the

 notification is twofold. First, it ensures that the unit commander of the

person in custody will know the status of that member of the command and

can participate in later decision making that will affect the availability

of the member apprehended. Second, it ensures that law enforcement officials

will promptly bring the case and suspect before the commander, thus ensuring

that later procedural requirements of the code and these rules will be considered

and met if appropriate. This is parallel in intent to Fed. R. Crim. P. 5

and 5.1. 

### (e) Where an apprehension may be made.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 5. It is similar to Fed. R. Crim.

 P. 4(d)(2) but broader because the code is not similarly limited by geography. 

 Subsection

(2) adds the warrant requirement of _Payton v. New York,_ 445

U.S. 573 (1980), conforming the procedure to military practice. _

See also Steagald v. United States,_ 451 U.S. 204 (1981); _

United States v. Mitchell,_ 12 M.J. 265 (C.M.A. 1982); _United

States v. Davis,_ 8 M.J. 79 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v.

Jamison,_ 2 M.J. 906 (A.C.M.R. 1976). The first sentence clarifies

the extent of Payton by citing examples of the kinds of dwellings in which

one may and may not reasonably expect privacy to be protected to such a

degree as to require application of _Payton_. Subsection (C)

joins the warrant requirement to the traditional power of military commanders,

and military judges when empowered, to authorize similar intrusions for

searches generally and other kinds of seizures. The first sentence of the

last paragraph in subsection (2) is based on _Steagald v. United States,

supra_ . The Working Group does not regard _Steagald_ as

requiring an exclusionary rule or supplying standing to an accused on behalf

of a third party when the accused's right to privacy was not violated. _

See Rakas v. Illinois,_ 439 U.S. 128 (1978). Failure to secure authorization

or warrant to enter a private dwelling not occupied by the person to be apprehended

may violate the rights of residents of that private dwelling. 

## Rule 303. Investigation of charges

This rule is based on paragraph 32 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Much of

the predecessor now appears in the accompanying discussion. 

## Rule 304. Pretrial restraint

### (a) Types of pretrial restraint.

Except for the "conditions on liberty" provision, which

 is new, this subsection is based on paragraphs 20 _a, b,_ and _

c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Some of the former Manual which explained

the distinction between arrest and restriction in lieu thereof and which

described the consequences of breaking restrictions has been moved to the

Discussion. 

 The "conditions on liberty" provision

is set out separately in the Manual for the first time, although such conditions

(several examples of which are included in the Discussion) have been in

practice previously and have received judicial recognition. _ See United

States v. Heard,_ 3 M.J. 14, 20 (C.M.A. 1977); _cf. Pearson

v. Cox,_ 10 M.J. 317, 321 n.2 (C.M.A. 1981) (conditions during

period of deferment of adjudged sentence). Such conditions also parallel

the conditions on release described in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3146(a). _

See also ABA Standards, Pretrial Release_ &sect; 10-5.2 (1979).

The discussion notes that pretrial restraint, including conditions on liberty,

 may not improperly hinder trial preparation. _See United States v.

Aycock,_ 15 U.S.C.M.A. 158, 35 C.M.R. 130 (1964); _United

States v. Wysong,_ 9 U.S.C.M.A. 249, 26 C.M.R. 29 (1958). 

 The

last sentence of the second paragraph of the discussion is based on _

United States v. Weisenmuller_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 636, 38 C.M.R. 434

(1968); _United States v. Smith_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 427, 38 C.M.R.

225 (1968); _United States v. Williams,_ 16 U.S.C.M.A. 589,

37 C.M.R. 209 (1967). _See also United States v. Nelson,_ 5

M.J. 189 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Powell,_ 2 M.J. 6

(C.M.A. 1976). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ A fourth paragraph

was added to the Discussion to provide a cross-reference to the speedy trial

rule in R.C.M. 707(a). 

### (b) Who may order pretrial restraint.

This subsection restates, in a reorganized format, paragraph 21

 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It is based on Article 9(b) and

(c). The code does not address forms of restraint less severe than arrest;

there is no reason to permit a broader class of persons than those who may

impose arrest or confinement to impose less severe forms of restraint. Subsection

(4) is based on _United States v. Gray,_ 6 U.S.C.M.A. 615,

20 C.M.R. 331 (1956). A commander who, under subsection (4), has withheld

 authority to order pretrial restraint may, of course, later modify or rescind

 such withholding. Even if such modification or rescission is denominated

a "delegation," it would be a rescission of the earlier withholding.

The limits of subsection (3) would not apply. 

### (c) When a person may be restrained.

This subsection is based on Articles 9(d) and 10. Although forms

of restraint less severe than arrest are not addressed by these articles,

it is appropriate to require probable cause and a need for restraint for

all forms of pretrial restraint. An officer imposing restraint has considerable

 discretion in determining how much restraint is necessary (_cf._ 18

U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3146(a) and 3147), although a decision to confine is

subject to thorough review under R.C.M. 305. The Discussion borrows from

the language of Article 13 to admonish that the restraint must serve only

the limited purpose of this rule. _ See_ subsection (f). _

See also United States v. Haynes,_ 15 U.S.C.M.A. 122, 35 C.M.R. 94

(1964). 

### (d) Procedures for ordering pretrial restraint.

This subsection is based on Article 9(b) and (c) and on paragraph

20 _d_(2) and (3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Since all forms of

restraint other than confinement are moral rather than physical, they can

be imposed only by notifying the person restrained. 

### (e) Notice of basis for restraint.

This subsection is based on Article 10. Since all forms of restraint

 other than confinement involve some form of communication with the accused

or suspect, this subsection will impose no undue burden on commanders. The

Discussion refers to R.C.M. 305(e) which contains additional notice requirements

for a person who is confined. Failure to comply with this subsection does

not entitle the accused to specific relief in the absence of a showing of

specific prejudice. _Cf. United States v. Jernigan,_ 582 F.

2d 1211 (9th Cir.), _cert. denied_, 439 U.S. 991 (1978); _

United States v. Grandi,_ 424 F. 2d 399 (2d Cir. 1970); cert. denied,

409 U.S. 870 (1972). 

 Pretrial restraint other than pretrial

confinement (_see_ R.C.M. 305(e)(2) and (f)) does not alone require advice

to the suspect of the right to detailed counsel or civilian counsel. Fed. R. Crim. P.5(c) is not analogous because the advice at the initial appearance serves

multiple purposes other than for pretrial restraint short of confinement.

The advice at the initial appearance is designed to protect the defendant

not only when pretrial confinement is imposed, but for events in the criminal

process which follow shortly thereafter. Thus, it is necessary under that

provision to inform a defendant of the right to counsel immediately because

 the suspect or accused may shortly thereafter be called upon to make important

 decisions. In contrast, the Rules for Courts-Martial treat each step in

the pretrial process separately and provide for advice of the right to counsel

when counsel is necessary. R.C.M. 305(e)(2) and (f) (pretrial confinement);

406 (detailing counsel for an accused in an investigation under Article 32);

503 and 506 (detailing counsel for an accused in courts-martial); Mil. R. Evid. 305 (warnings to accompany interrogations). The difference is a result

of the structural differences between these Rules and the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure. The intent and result of both systems are the same.

### (f) Punishment prohibited.

This section is based on Article 13; paragraph 18 _b_ (3)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the

House Comm. on Armed Services_, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 916 (1949). _

See also United States v. Bruce,_ 14 M.J. 254 (C.M.A. 1982); _

United States v. Davidson,_ 14 M.J. 81 (C.M.A. 1982); _United

States v. Pringle,_ 19 U.S.C.M.A. 324, 41 C.M.R. 324 (1970); _

United States v. Bayhand,_ 6 U.S.C.M.A. 762, 21 C.M.R. 84 (1956). _

Cf. Bell v. Wolfish_, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). The remedy for a violation

of this rule is meaningful sentence relief. _United States v. Pringle,

supra; United States v. Nelson,_ 18 U.S.C.M.A. 177, 39 C.M.R. 177

(1969). 

### (g) Release.

This subsection is based on 21 _d_ and on the second

 and third sentences of paragraph 22 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ The Discussion was amended to clarify that pretrial

restraint may be imposed not only when charges are to be reinstated but also

when a convening authority intends to order a rehearing or an "other"

trial. _See_ R.C.M. 1107(e). Restraint imposed during any

of these situations is considered "imposed before and during disposition

of offenses." _See_ R.C.M. 304(a). 

### (h) Administrative restraint.

This subsection clarifies the scope of this rule. 

## Rule 305. Pretrial confinement

 _Introduction._ This rule clarifies the basis for

pretrial confinement, and establishes procedures for the imposition and

review of pretrial confinement. The rule conforms with requirements established

 by recent decisions. _See United States v. Lynch,_ 13 M.J.

394 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Malia,_ 6 M.J. 65 (C.M.A.

1978); _United States v. Heard,_ 3 M.J. 14 (C.M.A. 1977); _

Cortney v. Williams,_ 1 M.J. 267 (C.M.A. 1976). The most significant

changes include: prevention of foreseeable serious misconduct as a basis

for pretrial confinement; a system of review of pretrial confinement by

neutral and detached officials; specific authority for a military judge to

 direct release of an accused from pretrial confinement; and a specific and

meaningful remedy for violation of the rule. 

 The Working Group

considered various procedural mechanisms for imposition and review of pretrial

confinement. Numerous practical, as well as legal, concerns were analyzed

and weighed in striking a balance between individual liberty and protection

of society. The Working Group proceeded from the premise that no person should

 be confined unnecessarily. Neither the prisoner nor the government benefits

 from unnecessary confinement. On the other hand, in determining when confinement

may be necessary, the nature of the military and its mission is an important

consideration. Moreover, some of the collateral impact associated with pretrial

confinement in civilian life (loss of job, income, and access to defense

counsel) is normally absent in the military setting and pretrial confinement

is seldom lengthy. _See_ R.C.M. 707. Finally, the procedures

for imposition and review of pretrial confinement had to be compatible with

 existing resources. More specific considerations are addressed below. 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of paragraph 20 _

c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence of that paragraph is

deleted here; the subject is treated at subsections (d) and (h)(2) of this

 rule. The first sentence of the discussion, with the addition of the words

 "of the United States," is Article 12. The second sentence is

new, and restates current practice. 

### (b) Who may be confined.

This subsection is new. It restates current law. 

### (c) Who may order confinement.

 _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 304(b). 

### (d) When a person may be confined.

This subsection contains the two basic codal prerequisites for

pretrial confinement: (1) probable cause to believe an offense has been committed

by the person to be confined (Article 9(d)); and (2) circumstances require

it (Article 10). This basic standard, which applies to all forms of pretrial

restraint, was selected here in lieu of a more detailed formulation since

the initial decision to confine often must be made under the pressure of

events. The discussion encourages consideration of the factors discussed

under (h)(2)(B) of this rule before confinement is ordered, and, as a practical

matter, this will probably occur in many cases, since persons ordering confinement

usually consider such matters in making their decision. An initial decision

 to confine is not illegal, however, merely because a detailed analysis of

the necessity for confinement does not precede it. _Cf. Gerstein

v. Pugh,_ 420 U.S. 103, 113-14 (1975). 

 The discussion

notes that confinement must be distinguished from custody incident to an

apprehension. _See_ R.C.M. 302. This paragraph is based on

Article 9(e) and paragraphs 19 _d_ and 174 _c_ and _

d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Article 9(e) expressly distinguishes confinement

 from measures to "secure the custody of an alleged offender until proper

 authority may be notified". Such periods of custody are not confinement

within the meaning of this rule. _See United States v. Ellsey,_ 16

U.S.C.M.A. 455, 37 C.M.R. 75 (1966). Such custody may continue only for the

period of time reasonably necessary for a proper authority under R.C.M. 304

to be notified and to act. _See_ Article 9(e). _See

also_ paragraphs 21 and 22, Part IV. 

### (e) Advice to the accused upon confinement.

Except for subsection (e)(1), which is based on Article 10 and

appeared in subparagraph 20 _d_ (4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) this

subsection is new. It is similar to Fed. R. Crim. P.5(c) which requires the

magistrate to give such advice to the defendant at the initial appearance.

The rule does not specify who shall inform the accused. This affords considerable

flexibility in implementing this provision. 

 Note that violation

of this subsection does not trigger the remedy in subsection (k) of this

rule. Consequently, a violation of this subsection must be tested for prejudice.

 _See_ Article 59. 

### (f) Military counsel.

This subsection is new. The primary purpose of the rule is to help

 protect the accused's interest in the pretrial confinement determinations.

Secondarily, this requirement should enable the accused to avoid injury to

the defense in subsequent proceedings, and, when necessary, to begin to marshal

a defense. _See e.g.,_ Article 49(a). The assignment of counsel

at this stage is of central importance to ensuring the fairness of the pretrial

confinement process. The requirement parallels similar requirements in federal

practice (Fed. R. Crim. P.5(c) and 44(a)) and under the District of Columbia

Code (D.C. Code &sect; 23-1322(c)(4)). _See generally United States

v. Jackson,_ 5 M.J. 223 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Mason,

_ 21 U.S.C.M.A. 389, 45 C.M.R. 163 (1972); _United States

v. Przybycien,_ 19 U.S.C.M.A. 120, 122 n.2, 41 C.M.R. 120, 122 n.2 (1969). Consequently, failure to do so triggers the remedy in subsection

(k) of this rule. 

 The subsection does not require that counsel

appointed at this stage will represent the prisoner throughout subsequent

proceedings. Although this would be desirable, the mobility of the armed

forces, the locations of confinement facilities, and the limits on legal

resources render an inflexible requirement in this regard impracticable.

Nothing in the code or the Constitution requires such early appointment of

 defense counsel for purposes of representation at trial. _Cf. Gerstein

 v. Pugh, supra_ at 123; _Kirby v. Illinois,_ 406 U.S.

682 (1972). _But see United States v. Jackson, supra._  Current

case law permits assignment of counsel for a limited duration, at least if

the limited nature of the relationship is made clear to the client at the

outset. _See United States v. Timberlake,_ 22 U.S.C.M.A.

117, 46 C.M.R. 117 (1973); _Stanten v. United States,_ 21

U.S.C.M.A. 431, 45 C.M.R. 205 (1972); _United States v. Kelker,_ 4

M.J. 323 (C.M.A. 1978); _cf. United States v. Booker,_ 5

M.J. 238 (C.M.A. 1977). Where such a limited relationship is the practice,

it should be included in the advice under subsection (e) of this rule to

help prevent misunderstanding. If the limited nature of the relationship

is not explained to the prisoner, it may not be possible, without the prisoner's

consent, to terminate the relationship for the convenience of the government. _

 United States v. Catt,_ 1 M.J. 41 (C.M.A. 1975); _United

States v. Eason,_ 21 U.S.C.M.A. 335, 45 C.M.R. 109 (1972); _

United States v. Murray,_ 20 U.S.C.M.A. 61, 42 C.M.R. 253 (1970). 

 Nothing

in this rule requires that counsel assigned for pretrial confinement purposes

be located near the prisoner. Once again, as desirable as this may be, such

a requirement would be impracticable. It is not uncommon for a prisoner

to be confined, at least initially, far from any available counsel. The

 rule is designed to afford the services considerable flexibility in dealing

 with such situations. The distance between the prisoner and defense counsel

should not pose a serious problem for the defense. They can communicate

by telephone, radio, or other means, and, under Mil. R. Evid. 502, such communications

would be protected by the attorney-client privilege. Moreover, since the

initial review may be accomplished without the presence of prisoner or defense

counsel, the defense counsel may submit appropriate written matters without

personal contact with either the prisoner or the reviewing officer. 

 _

1993 Amendment:_ The amendment to subsection (f) provides a specific

time period by which to measure compliance. Because it is possible to obtain

credit for violations of this section under subsection (k), a standard of

compliance was thought necessary. _See e.g., United States v. Chapman,

_ 26 M.J. 515 (A.C.M.R. 1988), _pet. denied_ 27 M.J.

404 (C.M.A. 1989). This amendment, while protecting the rights of the prisoner,

also gives reasonable protection to the Government in those cases where the

prisoner is confined in a civilian facility and the request is never, or

is belatedly, communicated to military authorities. While it is expected

that military authorities will have procedures whereby civilian confinement

authorities communicate such requests in a timely fashion, the failure to

communicate such a request, or the failure to notify military authorities

 in a timely manner should be tested for prejudice under Article 59 U.C.M.J.,

 and should not be considered as invoking the credit provisions of subsection

(k) of this rule. 

### (g) Who may direct release from confinement.

This subsection is a substantial change from the following language

 from paragraph 22 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.): "The proper authority to release

from confinement in a military confinement facility is the commanding officer

to whose authority that facility is subject." Notwithstanding this

provision, the authority of the commander to whose authority the confinement

facility is subject was often treated as ministerial in nature, at least

in some of the services. Authority to direct release was recognized to repose

in a commander of the accused. _See generally_ Boller, _

Pretrial Restraint in the Military,_ 50 Mil. L. Rev. 71, 96-99 (1970); _

see also United States v. Pringle,_ 19 U.S.C.M.A. 324, 41 C.M.R.

324 (1970). More recently, the authority of military judges (_see

Porter v. Richardson,_ 23 U.S.C.M.A. 704, 50 C.M.R. 910 (1975); _

Courtney v. Williams, supra)_ and officials appointed to do so under

 regulations (_see United States v. Malia, supra_) to order

 release from pretrial confinement has been recognized. The subsection expressly

establishes the authority of such officials to direct release from pretrial

 confinement. 

### (h) Notification and action by commander.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 11(b), although the terminology

 has been changed somewhat since the terms "commander of a guard"

and "master at arms" no longer accurately describes the confinement

personnel who are responsible for making the report. This subsection is

also important in setting in motion the procedures for approval or disapproval

of confinement. _See also,_ Fed. R. Crim. P.5(a). The discussion

is based on _Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the Comm.

on Armed Services of the House of Representatives_, 81st Cong., 1st

Sess. 913 (1949). 

 Subsection (2)(A) places the real initial decision

for pretrial confinement with the prisoner's commander. Although the immediate

commander may not be a neutral and detached official for pretrial confinement

 purposes (_United States v. Stuckey,_ 10 M.J. 347 (C.M.A.

 1981); _but cf. United States v. Ezell,_ 6 M.J. 307 (C.M.A.

1979); _Courtney v. Williams, supra_), it is appropriate to

give this officer the initial decision on pretrial confinement, so that the

command implications of this determination may be fully considered and developed

for later review. _See_ subsections (B) and (C). This will

enable the commander, who is in the best position to assess the predictive

elements of the pretrial confinement decision, including not only the prisoner's

likely behavior, but also the impact of release or confinement on mission

performance, to make a record of such factors for the initial review. Subsection

(2)(B) provides additional guidance for the commander in making this decision. 

 The

72-hour requirement is intended to ensure reasonably prompt action by the

commander, while at the same time allowing for situations in which the commander

is not immediately available. If a commander were unavailable for a longer

period, then some other official would normally qualify as acting commander

 (_see United States v. Kalscheuer,_ 11 M.J. 373 (C.M.A. 1981);

 _United States v. Murray,_ 12 U.S.C.M.A. 434, 31 C.M.R. 20

(1961); _United States v. Bunting,_ 4 U.S.C.M.A. 84, 15 C.M.R.

84 (1954)) or the prisoner would be attached to another unit whose commander

could act for these purposes. 

  _1993 Amendment:_ The

amendment to subsection (h)(2)(A) clarifies that the 72-hour period operates

in two distinct situations: (a) if the commander orders the prisoner into

 pretrial confinement, the commander has 72 hours to decide whether pretrial

confinement will continue; but (b) if someone other than the prisoner's commander

orders the prisoner into pretrial confinement, the prisoner's commander has

72 hours from receipt of a report that the prisoner has been confined to

decide whether pretrial confinement will continue. 

 Subsection

(2)(B) sets forth the standards for pretrial confinement. Probable cause

has long been recognized as a prerequisite to confinement in military law. _

 See_ Article 9(d); paragraph 20 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). Preventing flight is also well established as basis for confinement. _

See_ paragraph 20 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _

United States v. Bayhand,_ 6 U.S.C.M.A. 762, 21 C.M.R. 84 (1956).

Preventing foreseeable serious criminal misconduct has not been expressly

recognized in the Manual before, although it was probably included in the

"seriousness of the offense charged" language of paragraph 20

 _c_. _See e.g., United States v. Nixon,_ 21

U.S.C.M.A. 480, 45 C.M.R. 254 (1972). "Seriousness of the offense

charged" was rejected as an independent justification for pretrial

confinement in _United States v. Heard, supra,_ at least insofar

as it implied confinement may be ordered regardless of the need to prevent

 flight or serious criminal misconduct. _Cf. United States v. Nixon,

 supra; United States v. Jennings,_ 19 U.S.C.M.A. 88, 41 C.M.R. 88

(1969). 

 Although prevention of serious misconduct is expressly

authorized as a basis for pretrial confinement for the first time, it is,

as the foregoing analysis indicates, not new to military practice. Indeed

the phrase "foreseeable serious criminal misconduct" comes from

 _Heard. See also United States v. Nixon, supra; United States v.

Gaskins,_ 5 M.J. 772 (A.C.M.R. 1978); Dep't of Defense Directive

1325.4 (7 Oct 68). The need for confinement for such purposes has been recognized

and sanctioned in civilian communities. _United States v. Edwards,

_ 430 A.2d 1321 (D.C.C. 1981), _ cert. denied,_ 455 U.S.

1022 (1982). _See also_ U.S. Dep't of Justice, _Attorney

General's Task Force on Violent Crime, Final Report_ 50-53 (August

1981); Burger, _Report of the Chief Justice to the American Bar Association

_-1981, 67 A.B.A.J. 290, 292 (1981); Note, _Preventive

Detention Before Trial, _ 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1489 (1966). The need for

confinement to prevent serious misconduct is particularly acute in the military.

The business of military units and the interdependence of their members render

the likelihood of serious criminal misconduct by a person awaiting trial

of even graver concern than in civilian life. Moreover, as expressed in

the last sentence of subsection (B), these concerns render a broader range

or misconduct of a potentially serious nature. For example, the "quitter"

who disobeys orders and refuses to perform duties, while others are expected

to carry out unpleasant or dangerous tasks, has immensely adverse effect

on morale and discipline which, while intangible, can be more dangerous to

a military unit than physical violence. Thus, although the "pain in

the neck" (_United States v. Heard, supra_) may not

be confined before trial solely on that basis, the accused whose behavior

is not merely an irritant to the commander, but is rather an infection in

the unit may be so confined. Even constant supervision accomplishes little

 in such cases, and military resources do not permit, nor is it reasonable

to require, the establishment of some holding facility other than a confinement

facility for such persons. 

 The definition of national security

is based on Exec. Order No. 12065 &sect; 6-104 (June 28, 1978), 43 Fed. Reg.

28949, as amended by Exec. Order No. 12148 (July 1979), 44 Fed. Reg. 43239,

and Exec. Order No. 12148 (July 19, 1979), 44 Fed. Reg. 56673, _reprinted

at_ 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 401 (West Supp. 1982). The second ("includes")

phrase is taken from Joint Chiefs of Staff Publication 1, Dictionary of Military

 and Associated Terms 228 (1 July 79). 

 The factors for consideration

in the discussion are taken from 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3146(b), with minor modifications. _

See also ABA Standards, Pretrial Release_ &sect;&sect; 10-3.2, 10-3.3,

10-4.4(d), 10-5.1(b) (1979), "embraced" in _United States

v. Heard, supra_ at 23-24. The discussion also notes that the Military

Rules of Evidence do not apply to the information considered. Although the

commander's decision is not directly analogous to a bail determination before

a magistrate, this provision is consistent with 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3146(f). 

 The

last paragraph in the discussion is a reminder of the obligation to consider

less severe forms of restraint before approving continued confinement. _

United States v. Heard_ and _United States v. Gaskins,_ both _

supra._ The alternatives, which are also referred to in R.C.M. 304,

are derived from 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3146(a). 

 The procedures in

this rule are the same whether the basis of confinement is risk of flight

or foreseeable serious misconduct. This is appropriate since bail is unavailable

in the military. _United States v. Heard, supra;_ 18 U.S.C.

&sect; 3156. _Cf. Levy v. Resor,_ 17 U.S.C.M.A. 135,

37 C.M.R. 399 (1967). Since the decision is whether or not to confine, whether

the basis is risk of flight or foreseeable misconduct, and since the factual,

predictive, and discretionary determinations are qualitatively the same in

either case, there is no reason for procedures to differ concerning them.

Indeed, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals acknowledged that even

where possibility of bail exists in potential flight cases, the two determinations

involve the same fundamental considerations. _See United States v.

Edwards, supra_ at 1336-37. 

 The requirement for a memorandum

in subsection (2)(C) is new although not to military practice. _See

e.g.,_ AR 27-10, para. 9-5 _b_(1), 16-5 _

a_ (1 September 1982); SECNAVINST 1640.10, para. 6 (16 August 1978).

The memorandum is important to the remaining pretrial confinement procedures

since it ordinarily provides the primary basis for subsequent decisions concerning

pretrial confinement. 

### (i) Procedures for review of pretrial confinement.

This subsection is new, although it roughly parallels current practice

in the services. The requirement for review by an official, other than the

commander ordering the confinement, who is neutral and detached, in subsection

 (2) is consistent with the requirement of_Courtney v. Williams, supra.

_ Although in _United States v. Malia, supra,_ the

Court of Military Appeals identified the term "magistrate" with

the term "judge," the Working Group did not construe this to

require that a military judge must conduct the initial review. _

Cf. United States v. Lynch, supra._ Judicial review is provided in

subsection (j). Instead, the term as used in _Malia_ appears to denote a neutral

and detached official with independent power to review and order release

from pretrial confinement. In any event, it is not practicable to require

that the reviewing officer be a military judge, especially if the review

is to occur promptly and if the accused is to be permitted to appear personally

before the reviewing officer. There are not enough military judges available

to accomplish this task. Moreover, a legally trained magistrate is not necessary

since the pretrial confinement decision is essentially factual and predictive. _

Cf. Shadwick v. City of Tampa,_ 407 U.S. 345 (1972) (magistrate need

not be a lawyer). Thus the rule leaves the selection of reviewing officers

to service Secretaries. 

 The review must take place within 7 days

of the imposition of confinement under R.C.M. 305. This is a more extended

period than is the norm for an initial appearance in federal courts. _

See_ Fed. R. Crim. P.5(a); _Gerstein v. Pugh, supra._ However,

Federal courts are willing to tolerate delays of several days, so long as

the defendant does not suffer prejudice beyond the confinement itself during

such periods. _See e.g., United States v. Motes-Zarate,_ 552

F.2d 1330 (9th Cir. 1977), _cert. denied_, 435 U.S. 947 (1978); _

see generally_ 8 J. Moore, _Moore's Federal Practice,_ ch.

5 (1982). The 7-day period is more closely analogous to the time periods

 authorized for the preventive detention hearing under D.C. Code &sect; 23-1322(c)(3).

The 7-day period, with a possible extension up to 10 days, is intended to

accommodate a wide variety of circumstances. Because the review may be conducted

 entirely with written documents, without the prisoner's presence when circumstances

so dictate, there should be no reason why a reviewing officer cannot conduct

a review of the imposition of confinement within that time. Note that the

7-day period begins running from the time confinement is imposed by a person

authorized do so under subsection (c) of this rule. 

 _

1993 Amendment:_ The amendment to subsection (i)(1) provides that

the required review only becomes applicable whenever the accused is confined

under military control. For example, if the prisoner was apprehended and

is being held by civilian authorities as a military deserter in another state

from where the prisoner's unit is located and it takes three days to transfer

the prisoner to an appropriate confinement facility, the seven day period

under this rule would not begin to run until the date of the prisoner's transfer

to military authorities. Any unreasonable period of time that it may take

to bring a prisoner under military control should be tested for prejudice

under Article 59, U.C.M.J., and should not be considered as invoking the

credit provisions of subsection (k) of this rule absent evidence of bad faith

by military authorities in utilizing civilian custody. _But see United

States v. Ballesteros,_ 29 M.J. 14 (C.M.A. 1989). However, any time

spent in civilian custody at the request of military authorities would be

subject to pretrial confinement credit mandated by _United States

v. Allen,_ 17 M.J. 126 (C.M.A. 1984). 

 The amendment further

clarifies the method of calculation to determine if the rule has been violated. _

See United States v. DeLoatch,_ 25 M.J. 718 (A.C.M.R. 1987); _

contra, United States v. New,_ 23 M.J. 889 (A.C.M.R. 1987). 

 The

rule calls for a limited proceeding. Matters are to be presented in writing

to facilitate the promptness of the proceeding and to ensure that a record

is kept of the matters considered by the reviewing officer. Notwithstanding

some authority to the contrary (_United States v. Heard, supra_ at

25 (Fletcher, C.J., concurring); _ABA Standards, Pretrial Release

_ &sect; 10-5.9 (1979)), an adversary hearing is not required. _

Gerstein v. Pugh_ and _United States v. Edwards,_ both

 _supra._ Even if a more elaborate hearing might be called

for in the civilian sphere (_ABA Standards, supra; cf. United States

v. Wind,_ 527 F.2d 672 (6th Cir. 1975)), it is appropriate to consider

 the institutional goals and needs of the military in measuring the due process

 requirements for pretrial confinement. _Cf. Wolff v. McDonnell,_ 418

U.S. 539 (1974). _See Middendorf v. Henry,_ 425 U.S. 25 (1976); _

Parker v. Levy,_ 417 U.S. 733 (1974). The procedures in the review

include the opportunity for representation by counsel, access to all information

presented to the reviewing officer, the right to present matters for the

defense, and, ordinarily, the opportunity for the prisoner and defense counsel

to personally address the reviewing officer. Measured against the military's

mission, its structure and organization, and the resources available to

it, these procedures, coupled with the opportunity for judicial review at

an Article 39(a) session, adequately protect the liberty interests of the

prisoner. 

 The review procedures are patterned after the procedures

for parole revocation proceedings prescribed in _Morrissey v. Brewer,

_ 408 U.S. 471 (1972). There the Supreme Court required that an initial

review of parole revocation must be conducted by a neutral person, who need

not be a judge; the prisoner must receive notice and have an opportunity

to be present and speak, and to present written matters; and the hearing

officer must prepare an informal summary of the findings. (A later, more

thorough hearing, to be held within approximately 2 months is required under

_Morrissey_; judicial review under Article 39(a) coupled with the

trial itself fulfills these purposes for pretrial confinement). These requirements

are virtually identical to those in R.C.M. 305(i)(1). The only requirement

in _Morrissey_ not present in 305 is that the hearing officer

have discretionary power to call witnesses for purposes of confrontation.

On the other hand, R.C.M. 305 provides the prisoner with the opportunity

to obtain counsel in all cases. This is not required for parole or probation

revocation. _Gagnon v. Scarpelli,_ 411 U.S. 778 (1973). 

 Although

parole and probation revocations differ from pretrial confinement in that

in the former there has already been an adjudication of guilt, the distinction

cuts in the opposite direction insofar as (as was emphasized by the Supreme

Court in _Morrissey v. Brewer, supra_ at 482) the probationer

or parolee typically faces a long period of confinement, unlike the pretrial

confinee who, especially in the military, is not subjected to such a lengthy

period. Moreover, in _Gerstein v. Pugh, supra,_ the Supreme

Court, noting the burden of adversary hearings at this pretrial stage

(_id._ at 121 n. 23), distinguished _Morrissey_ and _

Gagnon_ from pretrial probable cause hearings (_id._ at

121 n. 21) and did not require an adversary hearing at such pretrial proceedings.

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals deciding that this holding in _

Gerstein_ applies to preventive detention hearings as well. _

United States v. Edwards, supra._ 

 The provision that

the Military Rules of Evidence do not apply at the initial review parallels

 federal civilian practice. _See_ 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3146(f).

The burden of proof is on the government. A preponderance standard was selected

because it strikes the best balance between the interests in the military

setting of the prisoner and society and because it is easily understood.

A higher standard is not constitutionally required. _Gerstein v. Pugh,

supra_ at 119-21. _See also Morrissey v. Brewer, supra_ at

485-89. Federal civilian courts may deny bail in capital cases if "the

court or judge has reason to believe that no one or more conditions of release

will reasonably assure that the person will not flee or pose a risk of danger

to the community." 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3148. In noncapital cases,

the judge "in the exercise of his discretion" decides whether

and how much bail will be set and hence, in effect, whether the prisoner

shall be released. 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3146(a). 

 Subsection

(7) specifically authorizes the presentation of additional matters to the

reviewing officer, and thus makes clear the continuing authority and responsibility

of that officer over pretrial confinement. This continuing authority is

necessary, especially in the unusual case in which referral of charges is

delayed.

 _2015 Amendment_: R.C.M. 305(i)(2) was revised to implement Articles 6b(a)(2)(E) and 6b(a)(4)(A), UCMJ, as created by Section 1701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013.

### (j) Review by military judge.

This subsection is new. MCM, 1969 (Rev.) did not provide for review

 of pretrial confinement by the military judge, and it was only recently

that the power of a military judge to order release from confinement was

recognized, at least implicitly. _See Porter v. Richardson, supra;

 United States v. Lamb,_ 6 M.J. 542 (N.C.M.R. 1978), _pet.

denied_, 6 M.J. 162 (1979); _ United States v. Otero,_ 5

M.J. 781 (A.C.M.R.), _pet. denied_, 6 M.J. 121 (1978). _

 Contra,_ paragraph 21_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 This

subsection establishes that the military judge has the power after referral

(_United States v. Newcomb,_ 5 M.J. 4 (C.M.A. 1977)) to review

pretrial confinement and to order release when appropriate. Two separate,

but related, issues may be involved: (1) whether the prisoner should be released

as of the time of the hearing; and (2) whether confinement already served

was legal. The prisoner may raise either or both of these issues by motion

for appropriate relief. All the procedures and protections normally attendant

to an Article 39(a) session (_see_ R.C.M. 803) apply. The

rule does not specify when such a session would take place. As with other

pretrial motions (_see_ R.C.M. 905) and with scheduling proceedings

generally (_see_ R.C.M. 801), the determination when an Article

39(a) session will be conducted and when a motion will be litigated is a

 matter within the sound discretion of the military judge. Note also that

the matter may be addressed in a conference under R.C.M. 802 and, if the

parties agree, resolved without need for an Article 39(a) session. The standards

for either decision posit that the reviewing officer's decision is entitled

to substantial weight (_see United States v. Otero, supra_)

and may not be overturned in the absence of an abuse of discretion, violation

of subsections (i)(1)(B) and (C) of this rule, or information not presented

to the reviewing officer. This procedure is analogous to the appeal provisions

in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3147. 

 The rule is silent concerning the overlapping

responsibilities of the military judge and the reviewing officer. Once charges

are referred, the need for a reviewing officer diminishes, and it could be

argued that the reviewing officer's role should terminate on referral. On

the other hand, even after referral, the reviewing officer may be more accessible

to the parties than the military judge, so that it was considered unwise

to rule out further action by the reviewing officer. 

 The remedy

for certain violations of the rule is prescribed in subsection (k) of this

rule and is analyzed below. Note that the military judge must order the remedy

when one or more of the identified violations occur. 

### (k) Remedy.

The requirement for an administrative credit for violations in

subsection (f), (h), (i), or (j) of this rule is based on _United

States v. Larner,_ 1 M.J. 371 (C.M.A. 1976). This credit is the sole

remedy for violation of these provisions. _See United States v. Nelson,

_ 18 U.S.C.M.A. 177, 39 C.M.R. 177 (1969). Violations of other provisions

would not render confinement illegal and hence would not trigger the sentence

relief requirements. Such violations would be tested for specific prejudice,

and, where such was found, would trigger a requirement to grant relief appropriate

to cure the prejudice suffered. Note that if one of the required steps is

 omitted, but the next step occurs within the time period for the omitted

step, and pretrial confinement is otherwise valid, no credit is required.

For example, if the commander does not prepare a memorandum under subsection

(h)(2)(C), but the review under subsection (i)(l) occurs within 72 hours

of imposition of restraint, and the grounds for pretrial confinement are

established, the accused is entitled to no credit. Similarly. if the military

judge reviews pretrial confinement under subsection (j) within 7 days of

the imposition of confinement and confinement is approved, the omission

of the review under subsection (i)(l) would not entitle the accused to credit. 

 The

one day credit is in addition to the day for day credit provided by DOD Instruction

1325.4 as interpreted by _United States v. Allen,_ 17 M.J.

126 (C.M.A. 1984) and is intended as an additional credit to deter violations

of the rule. This remedy does not replace sanctions against persons who intentionally

 violate these rules. _See_ Articles 97, and 98. The credit

for illegal pretrial confinement (in addition to any other administrative

credit) is provided as a matter of policy, and does not reflect a determination

 that such cumulative credit is otherwise required. 

 The credit

applies against confinement, if adjusted, and then against several other

specified penalties. Thus an accused entitled to sentence relief whose adjusted

sentence includes no confinement usually will receive some form of sentence

relief. Note, however, that the remedy does not apply to other forms of punishment

 including punitive discharges or reduction in grade. This is because these

 penalties are so qualitatively different from confinement that the fact

that an accused has served confinement which was technically illegal should

not automatically affect these forms of punishment. 

 The rule does

not prescribe the mechanics for implementing the credit since this will depend

 on the stage at which the violation of the rule is discovered. _Cf.

 United States v. Larner, supra._ Usually the illegality will be

determined by the trial judge, who shall also announce the remedy. After

the sentence is announced, the military judge should announce on the record

how the credit will apply to it. Where after application of this credit

no confinement would remain to be served the accused should not be confined

after trial. It is the responsibility of the convening authority to apply

credit when action is taken on the sentence. _See_ Article

57. 

### (l) Confinement after release.

This subsection is new and is intended to prevent a "revolving

 door" situation by giving finality to the decision to release. _

Cf. United States v. Malia, supra._ 

### (m) Exceptions.

This subsection is new. Its purpose is to eliminate several procedural

requirements in situations where military exigencies make then practically

impossible to comply with. Subsection (1) would apply not only to combat

situations, but also to circumstances in which a unit is deployed to a remote

area or on a sensitive mission, albeit one not necessarily involving combat. 

 Subsection

(2) recognizes the special problem of vessels at sea, and permits suspension

of certain procedural requirements in such cases.

#### (n) 2015 Amendment:

 R.C.M. 305(n) was created to implement Article 6b(a)(2)(E), UCMJ, as created by Section 1701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013.

## Rule 306. Initial disposition

 _Introduction._ Rule 306 describes who may dispose

of offenses and the options available to such authorities. Although these

matters are covered more thoroughly elsewhere (_see_ R.C.M.

401-407, and R.C.M. 601) they are included here to facilitate a chronological

approach to disposition of offenses. 

### (a) Who may dispose of offenses.

This rule and the first paragraph of the discussion are based on

 Articles 15, 22-24, and 30(b), and paragraphs 30-33, 35, and 128 of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The second sentence of the rule and the discussion are also

based on paragraphs 5 _b_(4) and 5_c_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Charette,_ 15 M.J. 197 (C.M.A.

1983); _United States v. Blaylock,_ 15 M.J. 190 (C.M.A. 1983). _

See also_ Article 37; _United States v. Hawthorne,_ 7

U.S.C.M.A. 293, 22 C.M.R. 83 (1956); _United States v. Rembert,_ 47

C.M.R. 755 (A.C.M.R. 1973); _pet. denied_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 598

(1974). 

 As noted in the second paragraph of the discussion a referral

 decision commits the disposition of an offense to the jurisdiction of a

specific judicial forum, and thus bars other action on that offense until

it is withdrawn from that court-martial by the convening authority or superior

 competent authority. _See United States v. Charette, United States

v. Blaylock_ both _supra._ _But see_ Article

44; R.C.M. 97(b)(2)(C). Neither dismissal of charges nor nonjudicial punishment

(for a serious offense) bars subsequent contrary action by the same or a

different commander. Thus, a decision to dismiss charges does not bar a superior

commander from acting on those charges if repreferred or from personally

preferring charges relating to the same offenses, if no jeopardy attached

to the earlier dismissal. _See Legal and Legislative Basis, Manual

for Courts-Martial, United States, 1951_, 47. Cf. _United

States v. Thompson,_ 251 U.S. 407 (1920); Fed. R. Crim. P. 48;_

United States v. Clay,_ 481 F.2d 133 (7th Cir.), _cert, denied,

_ 414 U.S. 1009 (1973); _Mann v. United States,_ 304

F.2d 394 (D.C.Cir.), _cert, denied,_ 371 U.S. 896 (1962). _

See also_ Article 44, and R.C.M. 905(g) and Analysis, and R.C.M.

907(b)(3) and Analysis. Similarly, imposition of nonjudicial punishment does

not bar a superior commander from referring the same offenses, if they are

serious, to a court-martial (Article 15(f); _ see also United States

v. Fretwell,_ 11 U.S.C.M.A. 377, 29 C.M.R. 193 (1960)), or from setting

aside punishment already imposed. Article 15(e). _See generally_ Part

V. 

### (b) Policy.

This subsection is based on paragraph 30 _g_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). Although it is guidance only, it is sufficiently important to

 warrant inclusion in the rules as a presidential statement. 

 The

second paragraph of the discussion provides guidelines for the exercise of

the discretion to dispose of offenses. Guideline (A) is based on paragraph

33 _h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Guidelines (B) through (G) are

based on _ABA Standards, Prosecution Function_ &sect; 3-3.9(b)

(1979). The other guidelines in &sect; 3-3.9 are not needed here: &sect;

3-3.9(a) (probable cause) is followed in the rule: &sect; 3-3.9(b)(i) is

inconsistent with the convening authority's judicial function; &sect;&sect;

 3-3.9(c) and (d) are unnecessary in military practice; and &sect; 3-3.9(e)

is implicit in &sect; 3-3.9(a) and in the rule requiring probable cause.

 Guidelines (H), (I), and (J) were added to acknowledge other practical considerations.

_ 2012 Amendment_: The second paragraph of the discussion following RCM 306(b) was revised to include consideration of the victim, consistent with the DoD Victim Witness Assistance program and current practice.  The listed factors were also reorganized from previous editions of the Manual.

### (c) How offenses may be disposed of.

This subsection is based generally on Articles 15, 22-24, and 30,

and paragraphs 32-35, and 128 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion provides

additional guidance on the disposition options. 

## Rule 307. Preferral of Charges

### (a) Who may prefer charges.

This subsection is based on Article 30 and paragraph 29_

b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The first sentence of the first

paragraph of the discussion is a new version of the former rule at paragraphs

5_a_(4) and 29 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which

provided that "A person subject to the code cannot be ordered to prefer

charges to which he is unable truthfully to make the required oath on his

own responsibility." This rule is subsumed in the oath requirement

of Article 30 and subsection (b) of the rule. The discussion clarifies the

circumstances under which an order to prefer charges may be given, but warns

against such orders in some circumstances in which they may tend to encourage

litigation or to invalidate an otherwise valid court-martial. The practice

of ordering persons to prefer charges has a historical basis. W. Winthrop,_

Military Law and Precedents_ 154 (2d ed. 1920 reprint); _

but cf._ _Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcommittee of the

House Committee on Armed Service_, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 850 (1949)

(reflecting the fact that under the code a person who orders another to prefer

charges is an accuser). 

 The second paragraph of the discussion

is a simplified version of paragraph 25 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion

observes that charges may be preferred against a person subject to trial by

court-martial at any time. _But see_ Article 43. Thus, when

charges may be preferred depends only on continued or renewed personal jurisdiction.

The policy forbidding accumulation of charges in paragraph 25 of MCM, 1969

(Rev.) is now general guidance in the discussion. Furthermore, the "reasonable

delay" aspects of the discussion are no longer contingent upon the

absence of pretrial arrest and confinement, because delay for a reasonable

period and good cause is always permitted. _See also_ R.C.M.

707. 

### (b) How charges are preferred; oath.

This subsection is taken from Article 30(a). This subsection is

similar in purpose to Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1)'s requirement that the indictment

or information "shall be signed by the attorney for the government."

 The same concept of requiring accountability for bringing allegations to

trial appears again at R.C.M. 601 (referral). 

 The first paragraph

of the discussion is based on Article 30 and paragraph 114_i_

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The last paragraph of the discussion is consistent

with Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(b). 

### (c) How to allege offenses.

Subsection (1) is based on paragraph 24a of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

nomenclature of charge and specification is imbedded in the code. _

Compare_ Articles 30, 34(b), 43(b), 45(b), 54(a), 61, and 62 _

with _ Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). Taking both the charge and specifications

together, the practice is entirely consistent with Fed. R. Crim. P. 7. There

is no need in military practice for the differentiating nomenclature for

indictments and informations (Fed. R. Crim P. 7(a)); in military practice the

same charges progress through the pretrial system without any change in nomenclature,

regardless of the level of court-martial by which they are ultimately disposed. _

See_ U.S. Const, amend. V. That further permits military practice

to disregard waiver of indictment (Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(b)) insofar as the pleadings

are concerned. Finally, military practice does not involve criminal forfeitures

in the same sense as federal civilian practice. _Cf._ Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(2).

 Subsection (2) is based on paragraph 24_a_ and

appendix 6_a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The definition is consistent

with that part of Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1) which requires that "The indictment

 or information shall state for each count the official or customary citation

of the statute, rule, regulation, or other provision of law which the defendant

is alleged therein to have violated." The first paragraph of the accompanying

discussion is based on paragraph 27 and appendix 6 _a_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The sources of the lettered subsections of the discussion are:

#### (A) Numbering charges

-paragraph 24, and paragraph 3 of appendix 6_a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.); 

#### (B) Additional charges

-id. 

#### (C) Preemption

-Article 134; 

#### (D) Charges under the law of war

-paragraph 12 of appendix 6_a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.).

 Subsection (3) restates Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1) in military

terms. That definition is consistent with paragraph 24_a_ and

Chapter VI of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The test of sufficiency of a specification

follows _United States v. Sell,_ 3 U.S.C.M.A. 202, 11 C.M.R.

202 (1953); paragraph 87 _a_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Paragraph

29_d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) is deleted as unnecessary. A specific

format for specifications is not prescribed. _See also_ Introductory

Discussion, Part IV.

_ 2004 Amendment: _The Rule

was amended by modifying language in the Discussion at (H)(ix), and moving

it in to the text of the Rule, to emphasize that facts that increase maximum

authorized punishments must be alleged and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. _Jones v. United States,_ 526 U.S. 227 (1999); _see

also Apprendi v. New Jersey,_ 530 U.S. 466 (2000). Prior convictions

are not required to be alleged in a specification because _Apprendi

_ and _Jones_ exempt prior convictions from those aggravating factors

that must be included in charging documents and proven beyond a reasonable

doubt. R.C.M. 1004 already establishes capital sentencing procedures that

satisfy an accused's constitutional rights in this area. _See Ring

v. Arizona,_ 536 U.S. 584 (2002).

_ 2012 Amendment._  Two new notes were added to address _Fosler_ (Article 134 specifications) and _Jones_ (lesser offenses). _See United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011) and _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). To state an offense under Article 134, practitioners should expressly allege at least one of the three terminal elements, i.e., that the alleged conduct was: prejudicial to good order and discipline; service discrediting; or a crime or offense not capital. _See Fosler_, 70 M.J. at 226; _United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012); paragraph 60c(6)(a) in Part IV of this Manual; and R.C.M 307(c)(3). _See also_ the analysis related to paragraph 60c(6)(a) in Appendix 23. For an explanation of clause 1, 2, and 3 offenses under Article 134, see paragraph 60c(1)-(4) in Part IV of this Manual. In 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces examined Article 79 and clarified the legal test for lesser included offenses. _See United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). Under _Jones_, an offense under Article 79 is "necessarily included" in the offense charged only if the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the greater offense alleged. 68 M.J. at 472. _See also_ discussion following paragraph 3b(1)(c) in Part IV of this Manual and the related analysis in Appendix 23.

_ 2015 Amendment._ In 2012, the committee added two  new notes to address the requirement to expressly state the terminal element in specifications under Article 134 and to address lesser included offenses. _See United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012); _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). In 2015, the Manual was amended to require the terminal element be expressed in Article 134 and to alter the definition of lesser included offenses under Article 79. _See_ paragraphs 3 and 60.c.(6) in Part IV of this Manual. The 2012 notes were removed.

 The sources of the lettered subsection of the accompanying discussion are: 

#### (A) Sample specifications

-paragraph 26 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

#### (B) Numbering specifications

-paragraph 3 of appendix 6 _a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.); 

#### (C) Name and description of the accused;

##### (i) Name

-paragraphs 4 and 5 of appendix 6a of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); 

##### (ii) Military association

-paragraph 4 of appendix 6_a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.); 

##### (iii) Social Security or service number

-paragraphs 4 and 6 of appendix 6 _a_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.) (note that the social security or service number ordinarily is

entered in the data at the top of the charge sheet; _see_

Appendix 4); and 

##### (iv) Basics of personal jurisdiction

-_United States v. Alef,_ 3 M.J. 414 (C.M.A.

1977). _See also_ Analysis, subsection (e)(3) Discussion (F)

(Subject-matter jurisdiction) of this rule. 

##### (D) Date and time of offense

-paragraph 7 of appendix 6 _a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). As to "on or about," _ see United States v. Heard,

_ 443 F.2d 856, 859 (6th Cir. 1971); 

#### (E) Place of offense

-paragraph 7 of appendix 6 _a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.); 

#### (F) Subject-matter jurisdiction

-_United States v. Alef, supra._ As to subsection

(iii), _United States v. Trottier,_ 9 M.J. 337 (C.M.A. 1980)

(jurisdiction over drug offenses). As to subsection (iv), _United

States v. Newvine,_ 23 U.S.C.M.A. 208, 48 C.M.R. 960 (1974); _

United States v. Keaton,_ 19 U.S.C.M.R. 64, 41 C.M.R. 64 (1969).

 The guidance here is not prescriptive, just as the inclusion of subject-matter

jurisdiction in the sample specifications (Part IV) is always parenthetical,

a reminder and not as a requirement. The Working Group does not consider

any particular format for such pleadings required by _Alef._ 

 Questions

of jurisdiction are interlocutory questions to be decided by the military

judge applying a preponderance standard. _See_ R.C.M. 905(c);

907(b)(1)(A), and _United States v. Ruiz,_ 4 M.J. 85 (C.M.A.1977); _

United States v. Kuriger,_ 4 M.J. 84 (C.M.A. 1977); _United

States v. Cherry,_ 4 M.J. 83 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States

v. McCarthy,_ 2 M.J. 26, 28 n.1 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States

v. Jessie,_ 5 M.J. 573 (A.C.M.R.), _pet. denied,_

5 M.J. 300 (1978). _See also United States v. Laws,_ 11 M.J.

475 (C.M.A. 1981). Ordinarily this finding will not be disturbed by findings

by exceptions and substitutions on the general issue of guilt because of the

 higher standard of proof involved in such determinations. _See generally

James, Pleadings and Practice under United States v. Alef,_ 20 A.F.L.

Rev. 22 (1978).

 _1995 Amendment_: The discussion

was amended in conformance with a concurrent change to R.C.M. 203, in light

of _Solorio v. United States_, 483 U.S. 435 (1987). _

O'Callahan v. Parker _, 395 U.S. 258 (1969), held that an offense

under the code could not be tried by court-martial unless the offense was

"service connected." _Solorio_ overruled _

O'Callahan_. 

#### (G) Description of offense.

_ 2015 Amendment._ In 2012, a new note was added to address the requirement to expressly state the terminal element in specifications under Article 134. _See United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012); _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011).

 The sources of the subsections under (G) are:

##### (i) Elements

##### (v) 2015 Amendment.

Subparagraph (v) was added to address lesser included offenses and refer practitioners to Article 79 and new Appendix 12A. _See_ paragraph 3 in Part IV and Appendix 12A.

#### (H) Other considerations in drafting specifications.

-The sources of the sections are: 

##### (i) Principals

-paragraph 9 of appendix 6 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

##### (ii) Victim

(Rev.); 

##### (v) Documents

-paragraph 28 _c_, and paragraph 14 of appendix

6 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); 

##### (vi) Orders

-(a), (b)- _id._; (c) _Negating exceptions-

United States v. Cuffee_, 10 M.J. 381 (C.M.A. 1981); _United

States v. Gohagen_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 175, 7 C.M.R. 51 (1953); 

##### (vii) Oral Statements

-paragraph 28 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); 

##### (viii) Joint offenses

-paragraph 26 _d_ and paragraph 8 of appendix

6 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); 

##### (ix) Matters in aggravation

-paragraph 127 _c_ (Table of Maximum Punishments)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Venerable_, 19 U.S.C.M.A.

174, 41 C.M.R. 174 (1970). 

 Subsection (4) is less restrictive

than the former and traditional military practice reflected at paragraphs

25, 26 _b_ and _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which

favored trial of all known offenses at a single trial, but complicated that

policy with policies against joining major and minor offenses and accumulating

charges. The confusion is eliminated by leaving to the discretion of the convening

authority which charges and specifications will be tried. _See_ R.C.M.

601(d) and accompanying discussion. The rule in this subsection does not

follow Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a), because that rule is entirely too unwieldy for

a military criminal system, particularly in combat or deployment.

 _2005 Amendment_:  The first sentence of the non-binding discussion was moved to subsection (4) to reflect the decision of _United States v. Quiroz_, which identifies the prohibition against the unreasonable multiplication of charges as a "a long-standing principle" of military law.  _See United States v. Quiroz_, 55 M.J. 334, 337 (C.A.A.F. 2001).

 _2015 Amendment_.  The discussion section was added to R.C.M. 307(c)(4) to clarify the ambiguity between the two distinct concepts of multiplicity and unreasonable multiplication of charges. For analysis related to multiplicity, _see_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B) in this Appendix.  For analysis related to unreasonable multiplication of charges, _see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12) in this Appendix.

 Nothing in the rule  or the discussion section should be construed to imply that it would be overreaching for a prosecutor to bring several charges against an accused for what essentially amounts to one transaction if there is a valid legal reason to do so. For example, prosecutors may charge two offenses for exigencies of proof, which is a long accepted practice in military law. _See, e.g., United States v. Morton_, 69 M.J. 12 (C.A.A.F. 2010). The discussion section emphasizes that a prosecutor is not overreaching or abusing his or her discretion merely because he or she charges what is essentially one act under several different charges or specifications.

 The language in the discussion section of the 2012 edition of the Manual referring to _United States v. Campbell_, 71 M.J. 19 (C.A.A.F. 2012), was removed because it is no longer necessary, as the rules themselves have been edited to remove any reference to "multiplicious for sentencing." The example was removed from the discussion section because it overly generalized the concept of unreasonable multiplication of charges.

 Subsection

(5) follows Fed. R. Crim. P.8(b). The civilian rule is consistent with the former

approach of paragraph 26 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The present

rule goes even further by making it possible to allege related offenses against

co-actors on a single charge sheet, but the rule does not require that approach.

The rule is also consistent with the provision for common trials of paragraph

33 _1_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (d) Harmless error in citation.

The subsection restates in military nomenclature Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(3).

The subsection is consistent with paragraphs 27 and 28 _c_,

and paragraph 12 of appendix 6 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It

 is not intended to provide a comprehensive rule on harmless error in drafting

specifications. 

## Rule 308. Notification to accused of charges

### (a) Immediate commander.

This subsection paraphrases paragraphs 32 _f_(1)

and 33 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See_ Article

30. This subsection deletes the requirement for a report of the circumstances

that make compliance impossible. The use of a certificate of notification

is encouraged in the discussion. The identification of known accusers, including

persons who ordered charges to be preferred, is new and protects the accused

against unauthorized acts by such persons. _See_ Article 1(9). 

 The

certificate requirement is abandoned only as a requirement, and use of such

certificates remains advisable, since they give evidence of compliance with

Article 10. However, to require a certificate might risk an excessive remedy

for a mere administrative failure to complete the certificate properly. 

 There

is no precisely analogous rule in the federal civilian rules, though the

federal civilian rules do reach the same end-to notify an accused of

the pendency of the allegations. Fed. R. Crim. P. 4 (arrest or summons upon

complaint), 5 (initial appearance), 5.1 (preliminary examination), 6 (grand

jury), 7 (indictment, information), and 9 (warrant or summons upon indictment

or information) all provide a civilian defendant with notice of the impending

prosecution. 

 The purpose of the subsection is to permit the accused

to begin preparing a defense. _United States v. Stebbins_,

33 C.M.R. 677 (C.G.B.R. 1963). The subsection originates in Articles 10 and

30 and is one of the fundamental rights of an accused. _United States

v. Clay_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 74, 1 C.M.R. 74 (1951). It gains additional

importance in this respect since the right of both the United States and

the accused to take depositions arises upon preferral. Article 49(a). 

### (b) Commanders at higher echelons.

This subsection reflects the same continuing duty to give notice

of the preferred charges that appeared at paragraph 33 _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (c) Remedy.

This subsection is new and is based on the approach taken in _

 United States v. Stebbins, supra_, and consistent with paragraph

58 (continuances and postponements) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER IV. FORWARDING AND DISPOSITION OF CHARGES

## Rule 401. Forwarding and disposition of charges in general

### (a) Who may dispose of charges.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 5, 32, 33, 35, and 128 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See_ Articles 15, 22-24.

The second sentence is based on _United States v. Hawthorne_,

 7 U.S.C.M.A. 293, 22 C.M.R. 83 (1956); _United States v. Rembert

_, 47 C.M.R. 755 (A.C.M.R. 1973), _pet. denied_, 23

U.S.C.M.A. 598 (1974). _See also United States v. Hardy_,

 4 M.J. 20 (C.M.A. 1977). A superior authority who withholds from a subordinate

 the authority to dispose of offenses (_see_ R.C.M. 306) or

charges may later modify or rescind such withholding. Even if such modification

 or rescission is denominated a "delegation," it would be a rescission

of the earlier withholding. 

### (b) Prompt determination.

This subsection is based on Article 30(b) and the first sentence

of paragraph 30 _i_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion

is also based on paragraphs 30 _ f_, 32 _b_,

 _c, f_(1), 33 _a, d, m,_ and 35 _ a

_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (c) How charges may be disposed of.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 32 and 33 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 Most matters in those paragraphs, including the mechanics of forwarding

charges, have been placed in the discussion as the practices of the services

vary because of differing command structures. Specific requirements and additional

details may be provided by service regulations. 

### (d) National security matters.

This subsection is based on the first sentence in the second paragraph

of paragraph 33 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ R.C.M. 407(b) and Article 43(e). 

## Rule 402. Action by commander not authorized to convene courts-martial

This rule is based on paragraph 32 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Paragraph

32 was written in terms of guidance. The structure of the paragraph and

the descriptions of the alternatives available to an immediate commander

 indicated the powers of such commanders. R.C.M. 402 expresses these powers.

 The mechanics of forwarding charges, dismissal of charges, the requirement

for prompt disposition, and guidance concerning these matters has been placed

in R.C.M. 401 and its discussion because these matters apply to commanders

at all levels. Other matters contained in paragraph 32 have been placed in

other rules. _ See_ R.C.M. 303 (preliminary inquiry); 308

 (notification of accused); 603 (amending charges). _See also_ R.C.M.

306 which includes guidance on disposition determinations. 

## Rule 403. Action by commander exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction

This rule and the discussion are based on paragraph 33 of MCM, 1969

 (Rev.). _See_ Article 24. Paragraph 33 was written in terms

of guidance. The structure of the paragraph and the descriptions of the alternatives

 available to the commander exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction

 indicated the powers of such commanders. R.C.M. 403 expresses these powers

in clearer terms. Several matters covered in paragraph 33 are now covered

in other rules. _See_ R.C.M. 303 (preliminary inquiry); 308

 (notification of accused); 401 (forwarding charges; discussion of suspected

insanity, joint or common trials); 601 (instructions in referral order; common

trials); 603 (amending charges). _See also_ R.C.M. 306. 

## Rule 404. Action by commander exercising special court-martial jurisdiction

 _This rule is new._ Paragraph 33 of MCM,

1969 (Rev.) treated both special and summary court-martial convening authorities. _

See_ paragraph 33 _ j_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); Analysis,

R.C.M. 403. 

## Rule 404A. Disclosure of matters following direction of preliminary hearing

_2015 Amendment_: This is a new rule created to implement Section 1702(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to preliminary hearings occurring on or after 26 December 2014. 

### Rule 405. Pretrial investigation

_2015 Amendment_: This rule was created to implement Section 1702(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013. This new rule took effect on 26 December 2014 pursuant to Section 531(g)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291, 19 December 2014, and applies to preliminary hearings occurring on or after 26 December 2014.

### Rule 406. Pretrial advice

#### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 34(a) as amended, Military

Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 4, 97 Stat. 1393

(1983); and on paragraph 35 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

#### (b) Contents.

This subsection is based on Article 34(a). It is consistent with

 paragraph 35 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) (except insofar as Article

34 is modified). Matters which paragraph 35 _c_ said "should"

be included are not required, but are listed in the discussion. The rule

states the minimum necessary to comply with Article 34(a). _Cf. United

States v. Greenwalt_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 569, 20 C.M.R. 285 (1955). 

 The

first paragraph in the discussion is based on paragraph 35 _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and _United States v. Hardin_, 7 M.J. 399

(C.M.A. 1979); _ United States v. Greenwalt, supra; United States

v. Schuller_, 5 U.S.C.M.A. 101, 17 C.M.R. 101 (1954); _ United

States v. Pahl_, 50 C.M.R. 885 (C.G.C.M.R. 1975). 

 The

second paragraph of the discussion is based on S.Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong.,

1st Sess. 17 (1983), and on the second sentence in paragraph 35 _

c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The last paragraph is based on _

United States v. Greenwalt, supra. See also United States v. Rivera_,

20 U.S.C.M.A. 6, 42 C.M.R. 198 (1970); _United States v. Henry_,

50 C.M.R. 685 (A.F.C.M.R.), _pet. denied_, 23 U.S.C.M.A.

666, 50 C.M.R. 903 (1975); _United States v. Barton_, 41

C.M.R. 464 (A.C.M.R. 1969). 

 _1991 Amendment:_ The

Discussion to R.C.M. 406(b) was amended to state explicitly the applicable

standard of proof. _See United States v. Engle_, 1 M.J. 387,

389 n.4 (C.M.A. 1976). The sentence concerning pretrial advice defects is

based upon _United States v. Murray_, 25 M.J. 445 (C.M.A.

1988), in which the court reviewed the legislative history to the 1983 amendment

to Article 34, U.C.M.J., and held that lack of a pretrial advice in violation

of the article is neither jurisdictional nor _per se_ prejudicial. 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ The Discussion to R.C.M. 406(b) was amended

to add as additional, non-binding guidance that the SJA should include the

recommendation of the Article 32 investigating officer.

#### (c) Distribution.

This subsection is based on Article 34(b), as amended, Military

 Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 4(b), 97 Stat.

1393 (1983). Paragraph 35 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) also required

that the staff judge advocate's recommendation be forwarded with the charges

if referred to trial. This subsection makes clear that the entire advice

is to be forwarded. This ensures that the advice can be subjected to judicial

review when necessary. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(3). _See

also United  States v. Collins_, 6 M.J. 256 (C.M.A. 1979); _

United States v. Engle, supra._

### Rule 407. Action by commander exercising general court-martial jurisdiction

#### (a) Disposition.

This subsection is based on Article 34(a) and paragraph 35 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See_ Article 22. 

#### (b) National security matters.

This subsection is based on the second and third sentences of the

 second paragraph of paragraph 33 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

and Article 43(e). It has been broadened to expressly recognize the authority

 of service Secretaries to promulgate regulations governing disposition of

 sensitive cases. Note that the rule applies regardless of whether hostilities

exist, although as the discussion notes the Article 43(e) procedure for

suspending the statute of limitations could only be used in time of war.

# CHAPTER CHAPTER V. COURT-MARTIAL COMPOSITION AND PERSONNEL; CONVENING COURT-MARTIAL

## Rule 501. Composition and personnel of courts-martial

### (a) Composition of courts-martial.

This subsection is based on Article 16. Except for the change in

the requirement as to the form of the request for trial by military judge

alone, it is consistent with paragraph 4 _a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

### (b) Counsel in general and special courts-martial.

This subsection is based on Article 27(a). Except for the change

 concerning who details counsel (_see_ R.C.M. 503(c)), it is

 consistent with paragraph 6 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). This

 subsection includes reference to detailing associate defense counsel. This

is based on Article 27(a), as amended Pub. L. No. 98 -209, &sect; 3(c),

(f), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

### (c) Other personnel.

This subsection is based on paragraph 7 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 502. Qualifications and duties of personnel of courts-martial

### (a) Members.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 25(a), (b) and (c) and on the

 first paragraph of paragraph 4 _b_ and paragraph 4 _

d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Factors which disqualify a person from serving

as a member are listed in R.C.M. 912(f)(1). 

 The discussion is

based on the second paragraph of paragraph 4 _b_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

 The references to use of members of the National Oceanic

and Atmospheric Administration and of the Public Health Service carry forward

the similar provision at paragraph 4 _ b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Similar provisions have been included in naval practice since at least 1937. _

 See, e.g., Naval Courts and Boards_ &sect; 347 (1937, 1945

reprint). The similar provision  in MCM, 1951 was upheld in _United

States v. Braud_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 192, 29 C.M.R. 8 (1960) (Public

Health Service commissioned officer served as member of Coast Guard court-martial), _

decision below_, 28 C.M.R. 692 (C.G.B.R. 1959). _Braud_ upheld

the provision even though Article 25 is arguably ambiguous and the P.H.S.

officer who served as a member had not been "militarized" and

 was not himself subject to the code. _Cf_. 42 U.S.C. &sect; 217

 (1976) (P.H.S. may be declared to be a military service in time of war;

members become subject to personal jurisdiction of Code); 33 U.S.C. &sect; 855

(NOAA may be transferred by President to military service in national emergency;

members become subject to personal jurisdiction of Code); Art. 2(a)(8) (jurisdiction

over members of Public Health Service and of Environmental Science Services

Administration). The Environmental Science Services Administration, which

succeeded the Coast and Geodetic Survey mentioned in some earlier Manuals,

is now defunct. Its functions were transferred to the National Oceanic and

 Atmospheric Administration. Reorg. Plan No. 4 of 1970, 3 C.F.R. 1075 (1966-1970

 Comp.), _reprinted in _ 84 Stat. 2090. NOAA has only a commissioned

officer corps. _ Id._ &sect; 2(f); 33  U.S.C.A. &sect; 851

(Supp. 1981). P.H.S. has both commissioned and warrant officers. 42 &sect; 204

 (Supp. 1981). 

 Subsection (2) and the discussion are based on

paragraph 41 _a_ and _b_ and the last paragraph

of paragraph 53_d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The admonition of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) that misconduct by members may constitute an offense and

that members should be attentive and dignified has been deleted as unnecessary.

### (b) President.

Subsection (1) is based on paragraph 40 _a_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). Subsections (2)(A) and (B) are based on paragraphs 40 _

b_(1)(c) and (d) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Paragraphs 40 _b_(1)

(a) and (b) are deleted. Paragraph 40 _b_(1)(a) conflicts

with the authority of the military judge under R.C.M. 801(a)(1). Paragraph

40 _b_(1)(b) is unnecessary. Subsection (2)(c) is based on

paragraph 40 _b_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The general description

of the duties of a president of a special court-martial without a military

judge in paragraph 40_b_(2) is deleted here. Such a summarized

 description is an inadequate substitute for familiarity with the rules

themselves. 

### (c) Qualifications of military judge.

This subsection and the discussion are based on Article 26(b) and

(c) and paragraph 4 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Reasons for

disqualification are described in R.C.M. 902. 

 _1999 Amendment:

_ R.C.M. 502(c) was amended to delete the requirement that military

judges be "on active duty" to enable Reserve Component judges

to conduct trials during periods of inactive duty for training (IDT) and

inactive duty training travel (IATT). The active duty requirement does not

appear in Article 26, UCMJ which prescribes the qualifications for military

judges. It appears to be a vestigial requirement from paragraph 4 _

e_ of the 1951 and 1969 MCM. Neither the current MCM nor its predecessors

provide an explanation for this additional requirement. It was deleted to

enhance efficiency in the military justice system. 

### (d) Counsel.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 27(b) and paragraph 6 of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The possibility of detailing associate counsel has been added

based on the amendment of Article 27(a) and 42(a). _See_ Military

Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 3(c), (f), 97

Stat. 1393  (1983). As the discussion indicates, "associate counsel"

 ordinarily refers to detailed counsel when the accused has military or

civilian counsel. _See_ Article 38(b)(6). An associate defense

counsel must be qualified to act as defense counsel. An assistant defense

counsel need not be. One other substantive change from MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

has been made. Detailed defense counsel in special courts-martial must be

certified by the Judge Advocate General concerned although this is not required

by Article 27(c). Article 27(c) permits representation of an accused by

a counsel not qualified and certified under Article 27(b) if the accused

does not request qualified counsel, having been given the opportunity to

do so, or when such counsel cannot be obtained on account of physical conditions

or military exigencies. In the latter event, no bad-conduct discharge may

be adjudged. Article 19. Currently, certified counsel is routinely provided

in all special courts-martial, so the modification of the rule will not change

existing practice. Moreover, the enforcement of waiver provisions in these

rules and the Military Rules of Evidence necessitate, both for fairness and

the orderly administration of justice, that the accused be represented by

qualified counsel. _See also United States v. Rivas_, 3 M.J.

282 (C.M.A. 1977). Because of this rule, the rule of equivalency in Article

27(c) and (3) is not necessary. 

 Subsection (2) is based on the

fifth sentence of the first paragraph of paragraph 6 _c_

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection (3) is based on the first sentence

of the second paragraph of paragraph 48 _a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.) and on _Soriano v. Hosken_, 9 M.J. 221 (C.M.A. 1980); _

United States v. Kraskouskas_, 9 U.S.C.M.A.  607, 26 C.M.R. 387 (1958).

The discussion is taken from _Soriano v. Hosken, supra._ 

 Subsection

(4) is based on Article 27(a) and on the fourth and fifth sentences of paragraph

6 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States

v. Catt_, 1 M.J. 41 (C.M.A. 1975). The accuser has been added to

the list of disqualifications. _See ABA Standards, The Prosecution Function_, &sect;&sect; 3-1(c); 3-3.9(c)(1979). 

 Subsection

(5) is based on paragraph 44 _d_ and 45 _a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on Article 38(d). The forum-based distinction as to

the powers of an assistant trial counsel has been deleted. The trial counsel

is responsible for the prosecution of the case. R.C.M. 805(c) requires the

presence of a qualified trial counsel at general courts-martial. The discussion

is based on paragraphs 44 _e, f, g_, and _h_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Some of the specific duties are now covered in other rules, _

e.g._, R.C.M. 701; 812, 813; 914; 919. Some examples and explanations

have been deleted as unnecessary. 

 The first sentence of subsections

(6) is new. _Cf._ paragraphs 46 _d_ and 48

 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence of subsection

(6) is based on Article 38(e). The rule does not require that defense counsel

in the court-martial represent the accused in administrative or civil actions

 arising out of the same offenses. The discussion is based on paragraphs 46

 _d_, 47, and 48 _c, d, e, f, g, h, j,_ and _

k_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The matters covered in paragraph 48 _

k_(2) and (3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) are modified in the discussion

based on the amendment of Articles 38(c) and 61. _See_ Military

Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect;&sect; 3(e)(3),

 5(b)(1), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). _See_ R.C.M. 1105; 1110.

As to associate counsel, _see_ the Analysis subsection (d)(1)

of this rule. _See also United States v. Breese_, 11 M.J.

17, 22 n.13 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Rivas, supra; United

States v.  Palenius_, 2 M.J. 86 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States

v. Goode_, 1 M.J. 3 (C.M.A. 1975). 

### (e) Interpreters, reporters, escorts, bailiffs, clerks, and guards.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 7, 49, 50, and 51 of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The list of disqualifications, except for the accuser, is new

and is intended to prevent circumstances which may detract from the integrity

 of the court-martial. 

### (f) Action upon discovery of disqualification or lack of qualification.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 41 _c_, 44

 _b_, 46 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 503. Detailing members, military judge, and counsel

### (a) Members.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 25. Because of the amendment

of Articles 26 and 27, the convening authority is no longer required to

detail personally the military judge and counsel. Military Justice Act of

1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209, &sect; 3(c), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983).

The last sentence of paragraph 4 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

is deleted as unnecessary. The second paragraph in the discussion serves

the same purpose as the third paragraph of paragraph 4 _b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.): to alert the convening authority to avoid appointing

people subject to removal for cause. Unlike that paragraph, however, no suggestion

is now made that the convening authority commits error by appointing such

persons, since the disqualifications are waivable. _See_ Analysis,

R.C.M. 912(f)(4). 

 Subsection (2) is based on Article 25(c) and

the third paragraph of paragraph 4 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The discussion is based on paragraph 36 _c_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (2) was amended

to reflect an amendment to Article 25(c)(1), UCMJ, in the "Military

Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII, &sect; 803, National

Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-661,

100 Stat. 3905, (1986) which authorizes enlisted accused to request orally

on the record that at least one-third of the members of courts-martial be

enlisted. 

 Subsection (3) is based on paragraphs 4 _f_ and

 _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (3) combines treatment

of members from a different command and those from a different armed force.

The power of a commander to detail members not under the convening authority's

 command is the same whether the members are in the same or a different armed

force. Therefore each situation can be covered in one rule. The discussion

repeats the preference for members, or at least a majority thereof, to be

of the same service as the accused which was found in paragraph 4 _

g_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Permission for the Judge Advocate General

to detail members of another armed force is no longer required in the Manual.

Detailing a military judge from a different command or armed force is now

covered in subsection (d). 

### (b) Military Judge.

Subsections (1) and (2) are based on Article 26(a), as amended,

 Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 3(c)(1),

97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The convening authority is no longer required to detail

personally the military judge. _Id._  Subsection (1)

requires that responsibility for detailing military judges will be in judicial

channels. _See Hearings on S.2521 Before the Subcomm. on Manpower

and Personnel of the Senate Comm. on Armed Services_, 97th Cong.,

2nd Sess. 52 (1982). More specific requirements will be provided in service

regulations. Subsection (2) is intended to make detailing the military judge

administratively efficient. _See_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong.,

1st Sess. 3-5, 12 (1983), H.R. Rep. No. 549, 98th Cong., 1st Sess.

13-14 (1983). As long as a qualified military  judge presides over

the court-martial, any irregularity in detailing a military judge is not

jurisdictional and would result in reversal only if specific prejudice were

shown. _ See_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1983). 

 Subsection

(3) is based on Article 26. _See also_ Article 6(a).

 _2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (b)(3) was amended to clarify that a military judge from any service may be detailed to a court-martial convened by a combatant or joint commander.

### (c) Counsel.

Subsections (1) and (2) are based on Article 27(a), as amended,

 Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 3(c)(2),

97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The convening authority is no longer required to detail

personally the counsel. _Id._ Efficient allocation of authority

for detailing counsel will depend on the organizational structure and operational

 requirements of each service. Therefore, specific requirements will be provided

in service regulations. Subsection (2) is intended to make detailing counsel

 administratively efficient. _See_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong.,

 1st Sess. 3-5, 12 (1983); H.R. Rep. No. 549, 98th Cong., 1st Sess.

13-14 (1983). Counsel are not a jurisdictional component of courts-martial. _

Wright v. United States_, 2 M.J. 9 (C.M.A. 1976). Any irregularity

 in detailing counsel would result in reversal only if specific prejudice

were shown. _See_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess.

12 (1983).

 Subsection (3) is based on Article 27. _See

also_ Article 6(a).

 _2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (c)(3) was amended to clarify that counsel from any service may be detailed to a court-martial convened by a combatant or joint commander.

## Rule 504. Convening courts-martial

### (a) In general.

This subsection substantially repeats the first sentence of paragraph

 36 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Who may convene courts-martial.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 22 and paragraph 5 _ a

_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The power of superiors to limit the authority

of subordinate convening authorities is based on paragraph 5 _b_(4)

 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Although that paragraph applied only to special and

 summary courts-martial, the same principle applies to general courts-martial. _

See_ Article 22(b). _See generally United States v. Hardy

_, 4 M.J. 20 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Hawthorne_,

7 U.S.C.M.A. 293, 22 C.M.R. 83 (1956); _United States v., Rembert

_, 47 C.M.R. 755 (A.C.M.R. 1973), _pet. denied_,

23 U.S.C.M.A. 598 (1974). The discussion is based on the second and third

 sentences of paragraph 5 _a_(5) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

 (2) is based on Article 23 and paragraphs 5 _ b_(1), (3),

and (4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (b)(2)(B) was amended to clarify those authorized to determine when a unit is "separate or detached."

 As to subsection (3), _see_ Analysis, R.C.M.  1302(a).

 Subsection (4) is based

on the first sentence of paragraph 5 _a_(5) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). _See also United States v. Greenwalt_, 6 U.S.C.M.A.

569, 20 C.M.R. 285 (1955); _United States v. Bunting_, 4 U.S.C.M.A.

84, 15 C.M.R. 84 (1954). 

### (c) Disqualification.

This subsection is based on Articles 22(b) and 23(b) and on paragraph

 5 _a_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Article

1(5) and (9); _United States v. Haygood_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 481,

31 C.M.R. 67 (1961); _United States v. LaGrange_, 1 U.S.C.M.A.

342,3 C.M.R. 76 (1952); _United States v. Kostes_, 38 C.M.R.

512 (A.B.R. 1967). 

### (d) Convening orders.

This subsection is based on paragraph 36 _b_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.) with two substantive modifications. First, in conformity with

the amendment of Articles 26(a) and 27(a), _see_ Military

 Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 3(c) 97 Stat.

 1393 (1983), the military judge and counsel are no longer included in the

convening order. _See_ R.C.M. 503(b) and (c) and Analysis.

 Second, several matters, such as the unit of any enlisted members, which

were required by paragraph 36 _b_ are not included here.

These may be required by service regulations. Summary courts-martial are

 treated separately from general and special courts-martial because of their

 different composition. 

### (e) Place.

This subsection is new. It derives from the convening authority's

 power to fix the place of trial (_see also_ R.C.M. 906(b)(11))

and from the convening authority's control of the resources for the trial.

 It does not change current practice. 

## Rule 505. Changes in members, military judge, and counsel

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of paragraph 37 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) except that it has been modified to conform

to the amendment of Articles 26(a) and 27(a). _See_ Military

 Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 3(c), 97 Stat.

 1393 (1983). The discussion is based on the third and fourth sentences of

paragraph 37 _c_ of MCM, 1969  (Rev.). 

### (b) Procedure.

This subsection is based on the first two sentences of paragraph

37 _c_(1) and on paragraph 37 _c_(2) of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Ware_, 5 M.J. 24 (C.M.A.

1978). It has been modified to reflect that military judges and counsel no

longer must be detailed by the convening authority. The second paragraph

in the discussion is based on _United States v. Herrington_,

8 M.J. 194 (C.M.A. 1980). References in paragraph 37 _b_ to

excusal as a result of challenges are deleted here as challenges are covered

in R.C.M. 902 and 912. 

### (c) Changes of members.

This subsection is based on Articles 25(e) and 29, and paragraphs

37 _b_ and _c_, and 39 _e_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The limitation on the authority of the convening authority's

 delegate to excuse no more than one-third of the members is based on S.

Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1983). 

### (d) Changes of detailed counsel.

Subsection (1) is based on that part of the second sentence of

paragraph 37 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which covered trial counsel. 

 Subsection

(2) is new and conforms to the amendment of Article 27(a) concerning who

details counsel. Subsection (2)(A) is consistent with that part of the second

sentence of paragraph 37 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which dealt

with defense counsel. Subsection (2)(B) is based on Article 38(b)(5); _

United States v. Catt_, 1 M.J. 41 (C.M.A. 1975); _United States

v. Timberlake_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 117, 46 C.M.R. 117 (1973); _

United States v. Andrews_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 165, 44 C.M.R. 219 (1972); _

United States v. Massey_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 486, 34 C.M.R. 266 (1964).

### (e) Change of military judge.

This subsection is based on Articles 26(a) and 29(d) and on paragraph

 39 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States

v. Smith_, 3 M.J. 490 (C.M.A. 1975). 

### (f) Good cause.

This subject is based on Article 29 and on _United States

v. Greenwell_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 560, 31 C.M.R. 146 (1961); _

United States v. Boysen_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 331, 29 C.M.R. 147 (1960); _

Unites States v. Grow_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 77, 11 C.M.R. 77 (1953). _

See_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1983). As to defense

counsel, _see also United States v. Catt, United States v. Timberlake,

United States v. Andrews_ , and _United States v.  Massey

_, all _ supra_.

## Rule 506. Accused's rights to counsel

### (a) In general.

This subsection is taken from the first two sentences of paragraph

48 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which was based on Article 38(b)

as amended. Act of November 20, 1981, Pub. L. No. 97-81; 95 Stat. 1085.

 Note that the amendment of Article 38(b) effectively overruled _United

 States v. Jordan_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 164, 46 C.M.R. 164 (1973), which

held that an accused who has civilian counsel is not entitled to individual

military counsel. The amendment of Article 38(b) provides that the accused

may be represented by civilian counsel "and" by detailed or

requested military counsel instead of civilian counsel "or"

requested military counsel as it formerly did. _See also_ H.R.

Rep. No. 306, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 4-7 (1981). 

 Nothing

in this rule is intended to limit the authority of the military judge to

ensure that the accused exercises the rights to counsel in a timely fashion

and that the progress of the trial is not unduly impeded. _See Morris

v. Slappy_, 461 U.S. (1983), 33 Cr.L. Rptr. 3013 (1983); _

United States v. Montoya_, 13 M.J. 268 (C.M.A. 1982); _United

States v. Kinard_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 300, 45 C.M.R. 74 (1972); _

United States v. Brown_, 10 M.J. 635 (A.C.M.R. 1980); _United

States v. Alicea-Baez_, 7 M.J. 989 (A.C.M.R. 1979); _United

States v. Livingston_, 7 M.J. 638 (A.C.M.R. 1979), _aff'd_ 8

 M.J. 828 (C.M.A. 1980). _See also United States v. Johnson_,

12 M.J 670 (A.C.M.R. 1981); _United States v. Kilby_, 3 M.J.

938 (N.C.M.R.), _pet. denied_, 4 M.J. 139 (1977). 

### (b) Individual military counsel.

Subsection (1) is based on paragraphs 48 _b_(1) and

 (2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Article 38(b); H.R. Rep.

No. 306, _ supra_ at 5-7; _United States v. Kelker

_, 4 M.J. 323 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Eason_,

21 U.S.C.M.A. 335, 45 C.M.R. 109 (1972); _United States v. Murray

_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 61, 42 C.M.R 253 (1970). The second sentence of

the last paragraph of this subsection has been modified based on the amendment

of Article 38(b)(7), Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209,

 &sect; 3(e)(2), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

 Subsection (2) is

taken from paragraph 48 _b_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ Article 38(b)(7). It ensures  substantial uniformity in

procedure among the services for handling requests for individual military

counsel. 

 Subsection (3) is based on the fourth through eighth

sentences in the second paragraph of paragraph 46 _d_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on Article 38(b)(6). _See also_ H.R.

Rep. No. 306, _supra_ at 4-7. Authority to excuse detailed

counsel has been modified based on the amendment of Article 38(b)(6). _

See_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 3(e)(1),

 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

### (c) Excusal or withdrawal.

This subsection is based on _United States v. Iverson_, 5 M.J. 440 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Palenius_, 2 M.J.

86 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Eason, supra_; _

United States v. Andrews_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 165, 44 C.M.R. 219 (1972). _

See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 505(c)(2). 

### (d) Waiver.

This subsection is based on the third sentence of the second paragraph

of paragraph 48 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on _Faretta

v. California_, 422 U.S. 806 (1975). As to the last two sentences, _

see id._ at 834 n.46. 

### (e) Nonlawyer present.

This subsection is based on the last sentence of the second paragraph

 of paragraph 48 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER VI. REFERRAL, SERVICE, AMENDMENT, AND WITHDRAWAL OF CHARGES

## Rule 601. Referral

### (a) In general.

This definition is new. MCM, 1969 (Rev.) did not define "referral."

### (b) Who may refer.

This section is also new, although MCM, 1969 (Rev) clearly implied

 that any convening authority could refer charges. _See also United

States v. Hardy_, 4 M.J. 29 (C.M.A. 1977). Paragraphs 5 _

b_(4) and 5 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) contained similar

provisions. 

### (c) Disqualification.

This section is added to the Manual to express the statutory disqualification

of an accuser to convene a court-martial in parallel terms in relation to

referral. _See_ Articles 22(b), 23(b). _Cf_.

Article 24(b). The discussion follows paragraph 33 _ i_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (d) When charges may be referred.

Subsection (1) is new. Neither the code nor MCM, 1969 (Rev) have

 previously provided a standard for referral except in general courts-martial. _

See_ Article 34(a). Subsection (1) promotes efficiency by helping

to prevent groundless charges from being referred for trial. This is consistent

 with Fed. R. Crim. P. 5.1(a). _Accord ABA Standards Prosecution Function

_ section 3-3.9(a) (1979). Consistent with the amendment of

Article 34, subsection (1) does not require the convening authority to evaluate

the legal sufficiency of the case personally. In general courts-martial the

legal sufficiency determination must be made by the staff judge advocate. _

See_ Article 34(a) and subsection (3)(2) of this rule. Subsection

(1) requires a similar determination in all courts-martial, including special

and summary courts-martial. Because of the judicial limitations on the sentencing

power of special and summary courts-martial, any judge advocate may make

the determination or the convening authority may do so personally. (A special

or summary court-martial convening authority does not always have access

to a judge advocate before referring charges; moreover, this subsection does

not require reference to a judge advocate, even if one is available, if the

convening authority elects to make the determination personally.) A person

who serves as a trial counsel is not disqualified from rendering this advice. _

 Cf. ABA Standards Prosecution Function_ Section 3-3.9(a) (1979).

Note that there is no requirement under this subsection that the judge advocate's

advice be written or that the convening authority memorialize the basis

of the referral in any way. 

 The "reasonable grounds"

standard is based on Article 34's prerequisite to referral of charges to

a general court-martial that the charges be warranted by the evidence in

the report of the Article 32 investigation. Further, the legislative history

of Article 32 strongly suggests that this is the intended standard of the

investigation. _Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm, of the House

Comm. on Armed Services_, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 997 -98 (1949).

Nothing suggests that the standard governing referral to inferior courts-martial

should be different from that applicable to general courts-martial. It appears

that the reasonable grounds standard has been in operation even without

an explicit requirement. _See, e.g., United States v. Eagle_,

1 M.J. 387, 389 n.4 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v. Kauffman_,

33 C.M.R. 748, 795  (A.F.B.R.), _rev'd on other grounds_,

14 U.S.C.M.A. 283, 34 C.M.R. 63 (1963). _Cf. Gerstein v. Pugh_,

420 U.S. 103 (1975). 

 Subsection (2) restates the prerequisites

for referral to a general court-martial of Articles 32 and 34. It is consistent

with paragraphs 30 _c_ and _d_, 34 _

a_, and 35 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) except insofar as the amendment of

Article 34 (_see_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No.

 98-209, &sect; 4, 97 Stat. 1393 (1983)) requires otherwise.

 The function of this provision is the same as paragraph 30 of MCM, 1969

(Rev.) to serve as a reminder of procedural limitations on referral. The

waiver provision is based on Article 32(d); S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st

Sess. 17 (1983); _United States v.  Schaffer_, 12 M.J. 425

(C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Ragan_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 119,

33 C.M.R. 331 (1963). 

### (e) How changes shall be referred.

Subsection (1) is consistent with paragraph 33 _j_(1)

 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The personal responsibility of the convening authority

to decide whether to refer and how to refer is emphasized, but the discussion

 makes clear that the administrative aspects of recording that decision may

be delegated. 

 The discussion's instructions for subsequent referrals

are based on paragraph 33 _j_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The

special case of referrals to summary courts-martial by the only officer present

in command follows paragraph 33 _j_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

and Article 24(b). 

 The discussion of limiting instructions follows

paragraphs 33 _j_(1) and _k_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). The advice that convening authorities be guided by the criteria

for capital punishment found at R.C.M. 1004 is new. _See Gregg v.

Georgia_, 428 U.S. 153, 225 (1976) (White, J., concurring in the

judgment). 

 The last paragraph of the discussion on transmitting

the referred charges and allied papers to the trial counsel is based on

paragraph 33 _j_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(2) is less restrictive than the previous military rule found at paragraphs

26 _b_ and _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which

cautioned against joining major and minor offenses. This rule is inconsistent

with Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a), which requires (in general) separate trials

for each offense. Such a requirement is too unwieldy to be effective, particularly

in combat or deployment. Joinder is entirely within the discretion of the

convening authority. The last two sentences of the rule dealing with additional

charges are based on paragraph 65 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The discussion encourages economy, following paragraph 33 _h_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The last sentence in subsection (2) is new and clarifies

that the accused may consent to the referral of additional charges after

arraignment. Since the prohibition of such referral is for the accused's

benefit, the accused may forego it when it would be the accused's advantage. _

See United States v.  Lee_, 14 M.J. 983 (N.M.C.M.R. 1983). 

 The

first two sentences of subsection (3) restate Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b) in military

nomenclature. They are consistent with the approach taken by paragraph 26 _

d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The last sentence is based on paragraph

33 _l_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). There is no counterpart in federal

 civilian practice.

 _2005 Amendment_:  The Discussion section was amended to reflect the rule changes that require the convening authority to affirmatively refer a capital punishment eligible offense for trial as a capital case.

 

### (f) Referral by other convening authorities.

This provision reflects the principle that a subordinate convening

authority's decision does not preempt different dispositions by superior

convening authorities. _See United States v. Charette_, 15

M.J. 197 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States v. Blaylock_, 15 M.J.

190 (C.M.A. 1983). _See also_ Analysis, R.C.M. 306(a), Analysis,

R.C.M. 905(g), and Analysis, R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C).

 _2015 Amendment_: (g) _Parallel convening authorities._ The intent of this new provision is to allow a successor convening authority to exercise full authority over charges, without having to effectuate re-referral or potentially a new trial. The subsection incorporates a recommendation of the May 2013 report of the Defense Legal Policy Board (DLPB), Report of the Subcommittee on Military Justice in Combat Zones. The DLPB is a Federal Advisory Committee established to provide independent advice to the Secretary of Defense. The DLPB found that an inhibition to retaining cases in an area of operations is the inability of a convening authority to transmit a case to another convening authority after referral of charges without having to withdraw the charges.

## Rule 602. Service of charges

This rule is based on Article 35 and paragraph 44 _h_

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Fed. R. Crim. P. 9 is consistent in purpose with this

rule, but not in structure. The warrant system of Fed. R. Crim. P. 9(a),

(b)(1), and (c) (2) is unnecessary in military practice. The remand provision

of Fed. R. Crim. P. 9(d) is inconsistent with the structure of military

procedure but consistent with the convening authority's discretion to refer

charges to a minor forum. _See_ R.C.M. 306. The provision

of Fed. R. Crim. P. 9(c) for service by mail or delivery to a residence

is inconsistent with Article 35. 

## Rule 603. Changes to charges and specifications

### (a) Minor changes defined.

This definition and the discussion consolidate the tests and examples

 found at paragraphs 33 _d_, 44 _f_(1), and

69 _b_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). They are consistent with Fed.

R. Crim. P. 7(e). 

### (b) Minor changes before arraignment.

This provision is based on and consolidates the authority of various

 persons to make minor changes as stated at paragraphs 33 _d_ and

44 _f_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It is inappropriate for an

Article 32 investigating officer to make changes, but an investigating officer

may recommend changes. _See also_ Article 34(b) which provides

authority for the staff judge advocate or legal officer to amend charges

or specifications for the reasons stated therein. 

### (c) Minor changes after arraignment.

This provision is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(e), which is generally

 consistent with military practice. 

### (d) Major changes.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 33 _d_ and

33 _e_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Article

34(b) which provides authority for the staff judge advocate or legal officer

to amend charges or specifications for the reasons stated therein. 

## Rule 604. Withdrawal of charges

### (a) Withdrawal.

This rule is based on paragraphs 5 _a_(6) and 56

 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The rule parallels Fed. R. Crim.

P. 48(a), but leave of the court is not required for the convening authority

to withdraw (or dismiss) charges and specifications. This would be inconsistent

 with the responsibilities of the convening authority under the Code. _

See_ Articles 34 and 60.  The potential abuses which the leave-of-court

requirement in the federal rule are designed to prevent are adequately prevented

by the restraint on a later referral of withdrawn charges in the subsection

(b). 

 The first paragraph in the discussion is new. It recognizes

the distinction between withdrawal of charges, which extinguishes the jurisdiction

of a court-martial over them, and dismissal of charges, which extinguishes

the charges themselves. The discussion cautions that withdrawn charges, like

any other unreferred charges, should be disposed of promptly. Dismissal of

charges disposes of those charges; it does not necessarily bar subsequent

disposition of the underlying offenses (_see_ Analysis, R.C.M.

306(a)), although a later preferral and referral would raise the same issues

as are discussed under subsection (b). 

 The second paragraph in

the discussion is based on the last sentence of paragraph 56 _a_

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The third paragraph in the discussion is

based on the second and fourth sentences in paragraph 56 _a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The first sentence of the fourth paragraph is

based on the third sentence of paragraph 56 _a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.) and _United States v. Charette_, 15 M.J. 197 (C.M.A.

1983); _United States v.  Blaylock_, 15 M.J. 190 (C.M.A. 1983).

The remainder of this paragraph is based on the second sentence of paragraph

56 _a_ and paragraph 56 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

### (b) Referral of withdrawn charges.

This rule is based on paragraphs 33 _j_(1) and 56

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and numerous decisions. _See, e.g., United States

v. Charette, United States v. Blaylock_, and _United States

v. Hardy_, all _ supra; United States v. Jackson_,

1 M.J. 242 (C.M.A. 1976); _ United States v. Walsh_, 22 U.S.C.M.A.

509, 47 C.M.R. 926 (1973); _Petty v. Convening Authority_,

20 U.S.C.M.A. 438, 43 C.M.R. 278 (1971). The second sentence in the rule

is derived from portions of paragraphs 56 _b_ and _

c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which were in turn based on _ Wade v.

Hunter_, 336 U.S. 684  (1949); _Legal and Legislative Basis,

Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1951_ at 64. _See

_ Article 44. The second sentence of paragraph 56 _ b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) has been deleted. That sentence suggested that withdrawal

after introduction of evidence on the merits for reasons other than urgent

and unforeseen military necessity would not bar re-referral in some cases.

If further prosecution is contemplated, such other possible grounds for terminating

the trial after introduction of evidence has begun are more appropriately

 subject to a judicial determination whether to declare a mistrial under R.C.M.

 915. 

 The first paragraph in the discussion contains a cross-reference

 to R.C.M. 915, Mistrial. Paragraph 56 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) dealt with both

withdrawal and mistrial. This was unnecessary and potentially confusing.

 Although the effect of a declaration of a mistrial may be similar to that

of withdrawal, the narrow legal bases for a mistrial (_see United

States v. Simonds_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 641, 36 C.M.R. 139 (1966)) should

be distinguished from withdrawal, which involves a far wider range of purposes

and considerations. _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 915. 

 The

second paragraph in the discussion is based on paragraph 56 _b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Unlike paragraph 56 _b_, the current rules

does not require a record in certain cases. Instead the discussion suggests

that such a record is desirable if the later referral is more onerous to

the accused. _See United States v. Blaylock, supra_ at 192

n.1; _ United States v. Hardy, supra_. 

 The third

paragraph in the discussion is based on _United States v. Charette,

United States v. Blaylock, United States v. Walsh_, and _

Petty v. Convening Authority_, all _supra; United States

v. Fleming_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 524, 40 C.M.R. 236 (1969). _See

_ Article 37. 

 The fourth paragraph in the discussion is

based generally on paragraphs 56 _b_ and _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), but more specificity is provided as to proper reasons

for withdrawal and its effect at certain stages of the proceedings. The grounds

for proper withdrawal and later referral are based on _United States

v. Charette, United States v. Blaylock, United States v. Jackson_,

all _supra_; _United States v. Lord_, 13 U.S.C.M.A.

 78, 32 C.M.R. 78 (1962); and current practice. _United States v.

Hardy_ and _United States v. Walsh_, both _

supra_, indicate that the commencement of court-martial proceedings

is, by itself, not important in analyzing the propriety of withdrawal. Arraignment

is normally the first significant milestone for the same reasons that make

it a cut-off point for other procedures. _See, e.g._, R.C.M.

 601; 603; 804. It should be noted that assembly of the court-martial, which

could precede arraignment, could also have an effect on the propriety of

a withdrawal, since this could raise questions about an improper intent to

 interfere with the exercise of codal rights or the impartiality of the court-martial.

The importance of the introduction of evidence is based on Article 44. _

# CHAPTER CHAPTER VII. PRETRIAL MATTERS

## Rule 701. Discovery

 _Introduction._ This rule is based on Article 46,

as well as Article 36. The rule is intended to promote full discovery to

the maximum extent possible consistent with legitimate needs for nondisclosure

 (_see e.g._, Mil. R. Evid. 301; Section V) and to eliminate

 "gamesmanship" from the discovery process. _See generally

ABA Standards, Discovery and Procedure Before Trial_ (1978). For

 reasons stated below, the rule provides for broader discovery than is required

 in Federal practice. _See_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1; 12.2; 16. _

See also_ 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3500. 

 Military discovery

practice has been quite liberal, although the sources of this practice are

 somewhat scattered. _See_ Articles 36 and 46; paragraphs 34,

44 _h_, and 115 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also United States v. Killebrew_, 9 M.J. 154 (C.M.A. 1980); _

United States v. Cumberledge_ 6 M.J. 203, 204 n.4 (C.M.A. 1979).

Providing broad discovery at an early stage reduces pretrial motions practice

and surprise and delay at trial. It leads to better informed judgment about

the merits of the case and encourages early decisions concerning withdrawal

of charges, motions, pleas, and composition of court-martial. In short, experience

has shown that broad discovery contributes substantially to the truth-finding

process and to the efficiency with which it functions. It is essential to

the administration of military justice; because assembling the military judge,

counsel, members, accused, and witnesses is frequently costly and time-consuming,

clarification or resolution of matters before trial is essential. 

 The

rule clarifies and expands (at least formally) discovery by the defense.

It also provides for the first time some discovery by the prosecution. _

See_ subsection (b) of the rule. Such discovery  serves the same

goal of efficiency. 

 Except for subsection (e), the rule deals

with discovery in terms of disclosure of matters known to or in the possession

of a party. Thus the defense is entitled to disclosure of matters known to

the trial counsel or in the possession of military authorities. Except as

provided in subsection (e), the defense is not entitled under this rule

to disclosure of matters not possessed by military authorities or to have

the trial counsel seek out and produce such matters for it. _But

see_ Mil. R. Evid. 506 concerning defense discovery of government

information generally. Subsection (e) may accord the defense the right to

have the Government assist the defense to secure evidence or information

when not to do so would deny the defense similar access to what the prosecution

would have if it were seeking the evidence or information. _See United

States v. Killebrew, supra; Halfacre v. Chambers_, 5 M.J. 1099 (C.M.A.

1976). 

### (a) Disclosure by the trial counsel.

This subsection is based in part on Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a), but

it provides for additional matters to be provided to the defense. _

See ABA Standards, Discovery and Procedure Before Trial_ &sect; 11-2.1

(1978). Where a request is  necessary, it is required to trigger the duty

to disclose as a means of specifying what must be produced. Without the request,

a trial counsel might be uncertain in many cases as to the extent of the

duty to obtain matters not in the trial counsel's immediate possession. A

 request should indicate with reasonable specificity what materials are sought.

When obviously discoverable materials are in the trial counsel's possession,

trial counsel should provide them to the defense without a request. "Inspect"

 includes the right to copy. _See_ subsection (h) of this rule. 

 Fed.

R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(A) is not included here because the matter is covered

in Mil. R. Evid. 304(d)(1). The discussion under subsection (a)(6) of this

rule lists other discovery and notice provisions in the Military of Evidence. 

 Subsection

(1) is based on paragraph 44 _h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ paragraph 33 _i_, _ id._ 18

U.S.C. &sect; 3500(a) is _contra_; the last sentence of Article 32(b)

reflects Congressional intent that the accused receive witness statements

before trial. 

 Subsection (2) is based on paragraph 115 _

c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and parallels Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(C)

and (D). 

 Subsection (3)(A) is based on the last sentence in the

second paragraph of paragraph 44 _h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ Appendix 5 at A5-1 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _

United States v. Webster_, 1 M.J. 216 (C.M.A. 1975). Subsection

(3)(B) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1(b). Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.2 (notice

based on mental condition) contains no parallel requirement for disclosure

of rebuttal witnesses by the prosecution. The defense will ordinarily have

such information because of the accused's participation in any court-ordered

 examination, so the distinction diminishes in practice. In the interest

of full disclosure and fairness, subsection (3)(B) requires the prosecution

to notify the defense of rebuttal witnesses on mental  responsibility. _

See also_ R.C.M. 706. 

 _1991 Amendment:_ Subsection

(a)(3)(B) was amended to provide for prosecution disclosure of rebuttal

witnesses to a defense of innocent ingestion. This conforms to the amendment

to R.C.M. 701(b).

 Subsection (4) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P.

16(a)(1)(B). The language is modified to make clear that the rule imposes

no duty on the trial counsel to seek out prior convictions. (There is an

ethical duty to exercise reasonable diligence in doing so, however. _

See ABA Code of Professional Responsibility_, DR 6-101(A)(2);

EC 6-4(1975).) The purpose of the rule is to put the defense on notice

of prior convictions of the accused which may be used against the accused

on the merits. Convictions for use on sentencing are covered under subsection

(a)(5). Because of this distinction, under some circumstances the trial counsel

may not be able to use a conviction on the merits because of lack of timely

notice, but may be able to use it on sentencing. 

 Subsection (5)

is based on paragraph 75 _b_(5) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) _

Cf._ Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3). 

 Subsection (6) is based

on _ABA Standards, The Prosecution Function_ &sect; 3-3.11(a)

(1979); _ABA Standards, Discovery and Procedure Before Trial_ &sect; 11-2.1(c)

 (1978). _ See also United States v. Agurs_, 427 U.S. 97 (1976); _

Brady v. Maryland_, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); _United States v.

 Brickey_, 16 M.J. 258 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States v. Horsey

_, 6 M.J. 112 (C.M.A.  1979); _United States v. Lucas_,

5 M.J. 167 (C.M.A. 1978); _ABA Code of Professional Responsibility

_, DR 7-103(B) (1975). __

### (b) Disclosure by defense.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1, 12.2, and 16(b)(1)(A)

and (B). _See generally Williams v. Florida_, 399 U.S. 78

(1970). The requirement in Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1 for a written request by

the prosecution for notice of an alibi defense was deleted because it would

 generate unnecessary paperwork. The accused is adequately protected by the

opportunity to request a bill of particulars. 

 _1986 Amendment.

_ The phrase "a mental disease, defect, or other condition

bearing upon the guilt of the accused" was deleted from this subsection,

with other language substituted, in conjunction with the implementation

of Article 50a, and the phrase "or partial mental responsibility"

was deleted from the discussion to conform to the amendment to R.C.M. 916(k)(2). 

 _

1991 Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(1) has been revised to expand the

open discovery that is characteristic of military practice. It provides the

trial counsel with reciprocal discovery and equal opportunity to interview

witnesses and inspect evidence as that available to the defense under subsection

(a). _See_ Article 46, U.C.M.J., and R.C.M. 701(e). Enhanced

 disclosure requirements for the defense are consistent with a growing number

of state jurisdictions that give the prosecution an independent right to

receive some discovery from the defense. _See_ Mosteller, _

 Discovery Against the Defense: Tilting the Adversarial Balance_,

74 Calif. L. Rev. 1567, 1579-1583 (1986).  Mandatory disclosure requirements

by the defense will better serve to foster the truth-finding process. 

 _

1991 Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(2) was revised to add the requirement

that the defense give notice of its intent to present the defense of innocent

ingestion. The innocent ingestion defense, often raised during trials for

wrongful use of a controlled substance, poses similar practical problems

(_e.g.,_ substantial delay in proceedings) as those generated

by an alibi defense, and thus merits similar special treatment. 

 _

2002 Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(4) was amended to take into consideration

the protections afforded by the new psychotherapist-patient privilege under

Mil. R. Evid. 513. 

 _1991 Amendment:_ Subsection

(b)(5) was amended to clarify that when the defense withdraws notice of

an intent to rely upon the alibi, innocent ingestion, or insanity defenses,

or to introduce expert testimony of the accused's mental condition, neither

evidence of such intention, nor statements made in connection therewith,

 are admissible against the servicemember who gave notice. This rule applies

 regardless of whether the person against whom the evidence is offered is

an accused or a witness. Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1 and 12.2,

upon which the subsection is based, were similarly amended

[_See_ H.R. Doc. No. 64, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 17-18 (1985)].

### (c) Failure to call witness.

This subsection is based on repealed subsection (a)(4) and (b)(3)

of Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. Those subsections were inadvertently left in that

rule after the notice of witnesses provisions were deleted by the conference

 committee. Act of December 12, 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-149, &sect; 5,

89 Stat. 806. _But see_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1(f). Because notice

of witnesses under R.C.M. 701 is required or otherwise encouraged

(_see also_ R.C.M. 703), such a provision is necessary in these rules.

### (d) Continuing duty to disclose.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(c). _See

also ABA Standards, Discovery and Procedure Before Trial_ &sect; 11-4.2

(1978). 

### (e) Access to witnesses and other evidence.

This subsection is based on Article 46; paragraphs 42 _ c

_ and 48 _h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States

v. Killebrew, supra; Halfacre, v. Chambers, supra; United States v. Enloe

_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 256, 35 C.M.R. 228 (1965); _United States

v. Aycock_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 158, 35 C.M.R. 130 (1964). The subsection

permits witness (e.g., informant) protection programs and prevents improper

interference with preparation of the case. _See United States v. Killebrew

_ and _United States v. Cumberledge, both supra_. _

See also_ subsection (f) of this rule; Mil. R. Evid. 507. 

 _

1986 Amendment._ The discussion was added, based on _United

States v. Treakle_, 18 M.J. 646 (A.C.M.R. 1984). _See also

United States v. Tucker_, 17 M.J. 519 (A.F.C.M.R. 1984); _

United States v. Lowery_, 18 M.J. 695 (A.F.C.M.R. 1984); _

United States v. Charles_, 15 M.J. 509 (A.F.C.M.R. 1982); _

United States v. Estes_, 28 C.M.R. 501 (A.B.R. 1959). 

### (f) Information not subject to disclosure.

This subsection is based on the privileges and protections in other

 rules (_see, e.g._, Mil. R. Evid. 301 and Section V). _

See also Goldberg v. United States_, 425 U.S. 94 (1976); _

United States v. Nobles_, 422 U.S. 225 (1975); _Hickman v.

 Taylor_, 329 U.S. 495 (1947). It differs from Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2)

because of the broader discovery requirements under this rule. Production

under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3500, is covered under R.C.M.

914. 

### (g) Regulation of discovery.

Subsection (1) is based on the last sentence of Fed. R. Crim. P.

 16(d)(2). It is a separate subsection to make clear that the military judge

has authority to regulate discovery generally, in accordance with the rule.

Local control of discovery is necessary because courts-martial are conducted

in such a wide variety of locations and conditions. _See also_ R.C.M.

108. 

 Subsection (g)(2) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(1). _

 Cf._ Mil. R. Evid. 505; 506. _See also ABA Standards, Discovery

and Procedures Before Trial_ &sect; 11-4.4 (1978). 

 Subsection

(g)(3) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2), but it also incorporates the

noncompliance provision of Fed. R. Crim. P.12.1(d) and 12.2(d). _

But see Williams v. Florida, supra_ at 83 n. 14; _Alicea

v. Gagnon_, 675 F. 2d 913 (7th Cir. 1982). The discussion is based

on _United States v. Myers_, 550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir. 1977),_

cert. denied_, 439 U.S. 847 (1978). 

 _1993 Amendment.

_ The amendment to R.C.M.  701(g)(3)(C), based on the decision of

 _Taylor v. Illinois_, 484 U.S. 400 (1988), recognizes that

the Sixth Amendment compulsory process right does not preclude a discovery

sanction that excludes the testimony of a material defense witness. This

 sanction, however, should be reserved to cases where the accused has willfully

 and blatantly violated applicable discovery rules, and alternative sanctions

could not have minimized the prejudice to the Government. _See Chappee

v. Commonwealth Massachusetts_, 659 F.Supp. 1220 (D. Mass. 1988).

The Discussion to R.C.M. 701(g)(3)(C) adopts the test, along with factors

the judge must consider, established by the _Taylor_ decision.

### (h) Inspect.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. 

## Rule 702. Depositions

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on the first sentence in Fed. R. Crim.

P. 15(a). The language concerning preferral of charges is added based on

Article 49(a). The language concerning use at Article 32 investigations

is also added because depositions may be used at such hearings. 

 

"Exceptional" means out of the ordinary. Depositions are not

taken routinely, but only when there is a specific need under the circumstances.

As used in Fed. R. Crim. P. 15(a) "exceptional circumstances"

is generally limited to preserving the testimony of a witness who is likely

to be unavailable for trial. _See_ 8 J. Moore, _Moore's

Federal Practice_ Para. 15.02[1]; 15.03 (1982

rev.ed.); _ United States v. Singleton_, 460 F.2d 1148 (2d

Cir. 1972). A deposition is not a discovery device under the Federal

rule. 8 J. Moore, _supra_ Para. 15.02[1]. _

See also United States v. Rich_, 580 F.2d 929 (9th Cir.), _

cert. denied_, 439 U.S. 935 (1978); _United States v. Adcock

_, 558 F.2d. 397 (8th Cir.), _cert. denied_, 434 U.S.

921 (1977). The Court of Military Appeals has held that depositions may

serve as a discovery device in certain unusual circumstances. _See

_ Analysis, subsection (c)(3)(A) _ infra_. Consequently,

"exceptional circumstances" may be somewhat broader in courts-martial.

Nevertheless, the primary purpose of this rule is to preserve the testimony

of unavailable witnesses for use at trial. _See_ Article 49; _

Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the Comm. on Armed Services_ 81st

Cong. 1st Sess. 1064-1070 (1949). 

 The first paragraph in

the discussion is based on Article 49(d) and (f) and on paragraph 117 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second and third paragraphs are based

on Article 49(d), (e), and (f); paragraph 117 _b_(11) of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.); Fed. R. Crim. P. 15(e). The admissibility of depositions

 is governed by Mil. R. Evid. 804 and by Article 49(d), (e), and (f) so it

is unnecessary to prescribe further rules governing their use in R.C.M.

702. As to Article 49(d)(1), _see United States v. Davis_,

19 U.S.C.M.A. 217, 41 C.M.R. 217 (1970). _See also United States

v. Bennett_ , 12 M.J. 463, 471 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States

v. Gaines_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 557, 43 C.M.R. 397 (1971); _United

States v. Bryson_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 329, 12 C.M.R. 85 (1953). The fourth

paragraph in the discussion is based on paragraphs 75 _b_(4)

and 75 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Who may order.

This subsection is based on Article 49(a) and on the second and

third sentences of paragraph 117 _b_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

As noted in subsection (i) the express approval of a competent authority

 is not required in order to take a deposition. _See also United States

 v. Ciarletta_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 606, 23 C.M.R. 70 (1957). Express approval

 may be necessary in order to secure the necessary personnel or other resources

for a deposition, when a subpoena will be necessary to compel the presence

of a witness, or when the parties do not agree to the deposition. 

### (c) Request to take deposition.

Subsection (1) is based on the first sentence in paragraph 117 _

b_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on the fourth

sentence of that paragraph. Subsection (2) is based on the fifth and sixth

 sentences in paragraph 117 _b_(1). 

 Subsection

(3)(A) is based on Article 49(a). The discussion provides guidance on what

may be good cause for denial. The discussion indicates that ordinarily the

purpose of a deposition is to preserve the testimony of a necessary witness

when that witness is likely to be unavailable for trial. _See_ Analysis,

subsection (a) of this rule. The Court of Military Appeals has held that

a deposition may be required in other circumstances described in the last

sentence of the discussion. _See United States v.  Killebrew_,

9 M.J. 154 (C.M.A. 1980); _United States v. Cumberledge_,

6 M.J. 203,  205, n.3 (C.M.A. 1979) (deposition may be appropriate means

to compel interview with witness when Government improperly impedes defense

access to a witness); _United States v. Chuculate_, 5 M.J.

143, 145 (C.M.A. 1978) (deposition may be an appropriate means to allow

sworn cross-examination of an essential witness who was unavailable at the

Article 32 hearing); _United States v. Chestnut_, 2 M.J.

84 (C.M.A. 1976) (deposition may be an appropriate means to cure error where

witness was improperly found unavailable at Article 32 hearing). _

Chuculate_ and _Chestnut_ have construed Article 49

as means of satisfying the discovery purposes of Article 32 when the Article

32 proceeding fails to do so. _Killebrew_ and _Cumberledge

_ have construed Article 49 as a means of permitting full investigation

and preparation by the defense when the Government improperly interferes.

Whether a deposition is an appropriate tool for the latter purpose may bear

further consideration, especially since R.C.M. 701(e) makes clear that such

 interference is improper. _See also_ R.C.M. 906(b)(7). 

 Subsection

(3)(B) is based on the first sentence of paragraph 117 _b_(1)

and on paragraphs 75 _b_(4) and _e_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Jacoby_, 11 U.S.C.M.A.

428, 29 C.M.R. 244 (1960). 

 Subsection (3)(C) is new and is self-explanatory. 

 Subsection

(3)(D) is based on _United States v. Cumberledge_ and _

United States v. Chuculate_, both _supra_. 

### (d) Action when request is approved.

Subsection (1) and its discussion are new. _See_

Article 49(c). Detailing the deposition officer is a ministerial act. When

it is intended that the deposition officer issue a subpoena, it is important

 that the deposition officer be properly detailed. In other cases, proper

 detailing is not of critical importance so long as the deposition officer

is qualified. _Cf. United States v. Ciarletta, supra._ 

 Subsection

(2) is based on paragraph 117 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). That

paragraph provided that the accused would have the same rights to counsel

as that for the trial at which the deposition could be used. Under R.C.M.

502, the accused has the right to qualified counsel at both general and special

courts-martial. If a summary court-martial is intended, ordinarily there

is no need for an oral deposition; instead, the summary court-martial should

be detailed and proceed to call the witness. Under subsection (g)(2)(A) the

accused at a summary court-martial is not entitled to counsel for a written

deposition. The first paragraph in the discussion is based on _United

States v. Catt_, 1 M.J. 41 (C.M.A. 1975); _United States v.

 Timberlake_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 117, 46 C.M.R. 117 (1973); _United

States v. Gaines,  supra. See also_ R.C.M. 505(d)(2)(B) and analysis.

The second paragraph in the discussion is based on the second sentence in

paragraph 117 _b_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The rule does not

prohibit the accused from waiving the right to counsel at a  deposition. _

See_ R.C.M. 506(d); _United States v. Howell_, 11

U.S.C.M.A. 712, 29 C.M.R. 528 (1960). 

 Subsection (3) is new and

reflects the ministerial role of the deposition officer. 

### (e) Notice.

This subsection is based on Article 49(b) and paragraph 117 _

 b_(4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It is consistent with Fed. R. Crim. P.

15(b). _See generally United States v. Donati_, 14 U.S.C.M.A.

 235, 34 C.M.R. 15 (1963). 

### (f) Duties of the deposition officer.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 117 _b_(5),

 (7), and (8) and _c_(3) and (4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It is

organized to provide a deposition officer a concise list of the duties of

that office. 

### (g) Procedure.

Subsection (1)(A) is based on paragraph 117 _b_(2)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); Fed. R. Crim. P. 15(b). _See also United States

v. Donati, supra._ Subsection (1)(B) is based on paragraph 117 _

b_ (6) and (7) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Fed.

R. Crim. P. 15(d). Subsection (2) is based on the first sentence of paragraph

117 _b_(2) and paragraph 117 _ c_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). Subsection (2)(B) is based on paragraph 117 _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note  that if the accused and counsel can be present,

it ordinarily is feasible to conduct an oral deposition. Written interrogatories

are expressly provided for in Article 49. 

 Subsection (3) is new

and is based on Article 49(d) and (f), as amended, Military Justice Act of

1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 6(b), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983).

The convening authority or military judge who orders the deposition has

discretion to decide whether it will be recorded in a transcript or by videotape,

audiotape, or similar material. Nothing in this rule is intended to require

that a deposition be recorded by videotape, audiotape, or similar material.

Factors the convening authority or military judge may consider include the

availability of a qualified reporter and the availability of recording equipment. _

See also United States v. Vietor_, 10 M.J. 69, 77 n.7 (C.M.A. 1980)

(Everett, C.J., concurring in the result). 

### (h) Objections.

This subsection is based on the second and third sentences of the

 penultimate paragraph of paragraph 117 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

and on Fed. R. Crim. P. 15(f). The waiver provisions are more specific than

 in paragraph 117 _b_ in order to ensure that objections are

 made when the defect arises. This promotes efficiency by permitting prompt

corrective action. _See_ Fed. R. Crim. P.15(f). This requirement

should  not be applied so as to unduly impede the taking of a deposition,

however. Only objections to matters which are correctable on the spot need

be made. For example, an objection to opinion testimony should ordinarily

 be made at the deposition so that the necessary foundation may be laid, if

 possible. On the other hand, objections on grounds of relevance ordinarily

are inappropriate at a deposition. Subsection (1) is also based on _

United States v. Ciarletta supra. See also United States v. Gaines_ and

 _United States v. Bryson_, both_supra_. Matters

which ordinarily are waived if not raised include lack of timely notice and

lack of qualifications of the deposition officer. 

### (i) Deposition by agreement not precluded.

This subsection is based on Article 49(a) and on Fed. R. Crim. P.

 15(g).

 _2015 Amendment_: This rule was revised to implement Article 49, UCMJ, as amended by Section 532 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291,

19 December 2014.

 

## Rule 703. Production of witnesses and evidence

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 46. 

### (b) Right to witnesses.

Subsections (1) and (2) are based on the fourth paragraph of paragraph

115 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second paragraph in the discussion

is based on _United States v. Roberts_, 10 M.J. 308 (C.M.A.

1981). _See also United States v. Jefferson_, 13 M.J. 1 (C.M.A.

1982); _United States v. Bennett_, 12 M.J. 463 (C.M.A. 1982); _

United States v. Credit_, 8 M.J. 190 (C.M.A. 1980) (Cook, J.); _

United States v. Hampton_, 7 M.J. 284 (C.M.A. 1979); _United

States v. Tangpuz_, 5 M.J. 426 (C.M.A. 1978) (Cook, J.); _

United States v. Lucas_, 5 M.J. 167 (C.M.A. 1978); _United

States v. Williams_, 3 M.J. 239 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States

v. Carpenter_, 1 M.J. 384 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v.

Iturralde-Aponte_, 1 M.J. 196 (C.M.A. 1975). _Cf._ Fed.

R. Crim. P. 17(b). _See generally_ 8 J.Moore, _Moore's

Federal Practice_ Para. 17.05 (1982 rev.ed).  Subsection (3) is based

on _United States v. Bennett, supra; United States v. Daniels_,

23 U.S.C.M.A. 94, 48 C.M.R. 655 (1974). _See also United States v.

Valenzuela-Bernal_, 458 U.S. 858, 102 S. Ct. 3440 (1982).

 _2007 Amendment_:  Subsection (b)(1) was amended to allow, under certain circumstances, the utilization of various types of remote testimony in lieu of the personal appearance of the witness.

### (c) Determining which witnesses will be produced.

This subsection is based generally on paragraph 115 _a_

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The procedure for obtaining witnesses under Fed. R.

Crim. P. 17 is not practicable in courts-martial. Under Fed. R. Crim. P.

17, witnesses are produced by process issued and administered by the court.

In the military trial judiciary, no comparable administrative infrastructure

capable of performing such a function exists, and it would be impracticable

 to create one solely for that purpose. The mechanics and costs of producing

 witnesses are the responsibility of the command which convened the court-martial.

Moreover, military judges often do not sit at fixed locations and must be

available for service in several commands or places. Note, however, that

any dispute as to production of a witness is subject to a judicial determination.

Experience has demonstrated that these administrative tasks should be the

responsibility of trial counsel.

 Subsection (1) is based on the

first three sentences in the fourth paragraph of paragraph 115 _a

_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection (2) is based generally

on the remainder of paragraph 115 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The procedure for production of defense witnesses prescribed in paragraph

115 _a_ was questioned in several decisions. _See United

States v. Arias_, 3 M.J. 436, 439 (C.M.A. 1977); _United

States v. Williams, supra_ at 240 n.2; _United States v. Carpenter,

supra_ at 386 n.8. The practical advantages of that procedure were

recognized, however, in _United States v. Vietor_, 10 M.J.

69, 77 (C.M.A. 1980) (Everett, C.J., concurring in the result). 

 Subsection

(2) modifies the former procedures to reduce the criticized aspects of the

earlier practice while retaining its practical advantages. For reasons states

above, the trial counsel is responsible for the administrative aspects of

production of witnesses. Thus, under subsection (2)(A) the defense submits

its list of witnesses to the trial counsel so that the latter can arrange

for their production. The trial counsel stands in a position similar to

a civilian clerk of court for this purpose. Because most defense requests

for witnesses are uncontested, judicial economy is served by routing the

list directly to the trial counsel, rather than to the military judge first.

This also allows the trial counsel to consider such alternatives as offering

to stipulate or take a deposition, or recommending to the convening authority

that a charge be withdrawn. _See United States v. Vietor, supra._ Further,

it allows arrangements to be made in a more timely manner, since the trial

counsel is usually more readily available than the military judge. Only if

there is a genuine dispute as to whether a witness must be produced is the

issue presented to the military judge by way of a motion. 

 Subsections

(2)(B) and (C) also further judicial economy and efficiency by facilitating

early arrangements for the production of witnesses and by permitting the

prompt identification and resolution of disputes. Subsection (2)(B) is based

on the fifth and sixth sentences of the fourth paragraph of  paragraph 115 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal,

supra; United States v. Wagner_, 5 M.J. 461  (C.M.A. 1978); _

United States v. Lucas_, 5 M.J. 167 (C.M.A. 1978). _Cf. United

States v. Hedgwood_, 562 F.2d 946 (5th Cir. 1977), _cert,

denied_, 434 U.S. 1079 (1978); _United States v. Barker_,

553 F.2d 1013 (6th Cir. 1977). Subsection (2)(C) is new. _See generally

United States v. Menoken_, 14 M.J. 10  (C.M.A. 1982); and _

United States v. Johnson_, 3 M.J. 772  (A.C.M.R.), _pet. denied

_, 4 M.J. 50 (1977). 

 Subsection (2)(D) provides for resolution

of disputes concerning witness production by the military judge. Application

to the convening authority for relief is not required. It is permitted under

R.C.M. 905(j). The last sentence in this subsection is based on _

United States v. Carpenter, supra. See_ subsection (b) of this rule

as to the test to be applied. 

### (d) Employment of expert witnesses.

This subsection is based on paragraph 116 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also United States v. Johnson_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 424, 47 C.M.R.

402 (1973); _Hutson v. United States_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 437,

42 C.M.R. 39 (1970). Because funding for such employment is the responsibility

of the command, not the court-martial, and because alternatives to such

employment may be available, application to the convening authority is appropriate.

 In most cases, the military's investigative, medical, or other agencies

can provide the necessary service. Therefore the convening authority should

have the opportunity to make available such services as an alternative. _

Cf. United States v. Johnson, supra; United States v. Simmons_,

44 C.M.R. 804 (A.C.M.R. 1971), _pet. denied_, 21 U.S.C.M.A.

628, 44 C.M.R. 940 (1972). This subsection has no reference to ratification

 of employment of an expert already retained, unlike 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3006A(e). _

See also_ Ms. Comp. Gen. B-49109 (June 25, 1949). This subsection

does not apply to persons who are government employees or under contract

to the Government to provide services which would otherwise fall within this

subsection. The reference in paragraph 116 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), to service

regulations has been deleted as unnecessary. 

### (e) Procedures for production.

Subsection (1) and the discussion are based on paragraph 115 _

 b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection (2)(A) is consistent

with current practice. 

 Subsection (2)(B) is based on Fed. R. Crim.

P. 17(a) and (c) and on Appendix 17 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See_ Article

46. The discussion is taken from the second sentence of the second paragraph

of paragraph 115 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note that the purpose

of producing books, papers, documents, and other objects before a proceeding

for inspection is to expedite the proceeding, not as a general discovery

mechanism. _See Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States_, 341 U.S.

214 (1951). _See generally United States v. Nixon_, 418 683

(1974). 

 Subsection (2)(C) is based on paragraph 79 _b_,

the third paragraph of paragraph 115 _a_, and the first sentence

of paragraph 115 _d_ (1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Authority for

the president of a court of inquiry and a deposition officer to issue a subpoena

is expressly added to fill the gap left by MCM, 1969 (Rev). in regard to

these procedures. _ See_ Article 47(a)(1), 135(f). 

 Subsection

(2)(D) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(d) and on the second sentence of

the fifth paragraph of paragraph 115 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). _See also_ 28 U.S.C. &sect; 569(b). The discussion

is based on paragraph 115 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(2)(E) is based on Article 46 and the first sentence of paragraph 115 _

d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It parallels Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(e)(1).

Process in courts-martial does not extend abroad, except in occupied territory,

nor may it be used to compel persons within the United States to attend courts-martial

abroad. _See_ Article 46; _United States v. Bennett,

supra; United States v. Daniels, supra; United States v. Stringer_,

5 U.S.C.M.A. 122, 17 C.M.R. 122 (1954). _But see United States v.

 Daniels, supra_ at 97, 48 C.M.R. at 658 (Quinn, J. concurring in

the result) (suggesting possible use of 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1783(a)

to secure presence of witness overseas to testify in a court-martial). The

discussion is based on the last paragraph of paragraph 115 _d_(1)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note that under subsection (2)(E)(iii) any civilians

in occupied territory are subject to compulsory process of the occupying

force. 

 Subsection (2)(F) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c), but

is broader in that is not limited to a subpoena duces tecum. _Cf.

_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(f)(2). 

 Subsection (2)(G) and the

discussion are based on paragraphs 115 _d_(2) and (3), MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The definition of "warrant of attachment" is based

on 12 Op. Atty. Gen. 501, 502 (1868). The military power to use a warrant

of attachment is inherent in the power to subpoena. 12 Op. Atty. Gen. 501

(1868) (construing Act of 3 March 1863, ch. 79, &sect; 25, 12 Stat.

754, which became Article of War 22 of 1916 (39 Stat. 654), the predecessor

of Article 46.). _ See also_ W. Winthrop, _Military

Law and Precedents_ 200-202, 202 n.46 (2d ed. 1920 reprint).

The power of attachment has been included in the Manuals for Courts-Martial

since 1895. Treatment of this enforcement provision in the Manual is in accord

with the legislative intent to "leave mechanical  details as to the

issuance of process to regulation." H. R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong.,

 1st Sess. 24 (1949). The power has been used and sustained.  _See,

e.g., United States v. Shibley_, 112 F. Supp. 734 (S.D. Cal. 1953)

(court of inquiry). Federal civilian courts have previously used the warrant

of attachment but no longer do because the power to issue an arrest warrant

is implied from Fed. R. Crim. P. 46(b) and 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3149. _

See Bacon v. United States_, 449 F.2d 933 (9th Cir. 1971) (arrest

of material witness for testimony at grand jury before actual disobedience

of subpoena). Warrants of attachment may be served in the same way and by

the same officials as subpoenas. By their nature warrants of attachment have

caused little litigation in military appellate courts. _ See generally

United States v. Sevaaetasi_, 48 C.M.R. 964 (A.C.M.R.), _

pet. denied_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 620, 49 C.M.R. 889 (1974); _ United

States v. Ercolin_, 46 C.M.R. 1259 (A.C.M.R. 1973); _ United

States v. Feeley_, 47 C.M.R. 581 (N.C.M.R.), _pet. denied

_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 635 (1973). 

 The procedure for issuing

warrants of attachment is modified somewhat. The warrant must be authorized

by the military judge, or, in special courts-martial without a military judge

and summary courts-martial_ (see_ subsection (e)(2)(G)(v)

of this rule), and for depositions and courts of inquiry, the convening

authority. Paragraph 115 _d_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) required

 only that the trial counsel consult with the convening authority, or "after

the court was convened" the military judge. Subsection (e)(2)(G) now

requires written authorization from one of these persons. Second, subsection

(e)(2)(G)(ii) incorporates as requirements the standards in the third paragraph

115 _d_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). That paragraph was seemingly

advisory in nature. Subsection (e)(2)(G)(iv) is based on the second paragraph

and the first sentence of the last paragraph of paragraph 115 _d_(3)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The last sentence of subsection (e)(2)(G)(iv) is new

and is intended to ensure that any detention under this rule is limited to

the minimum necessary to effect its purpose. These modifications provide

additional safeguards to ensure that detention of witnesses is exercised

only when necessary and appropriate. _See generally_ Lederer,_

Warrants of Attachment-Forcibly Compelling the Attendance of Witnesses

_; 98 Mil. L. Rev. 1 (1982). 

 _1998 Amendment._ The

Discussion was amended to reflect the amendment of Article 47, UCMJ, in section

1111 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub.

L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 461 (1996). The amendment removes limitations

on the punishment that a federal district court may impose for a civilian

witness' refusal to honor a subpoena to appear or testify before a court-martial.

 Previously, the maximum sentence for a recalcitrant witness was "a

fine of not more than $500.00, or imprisonment for not more than six months,

or both." The law now leaves the amount of confinement or fine to the

discretion of the federal district court.

### (f) Evidence.

This subsection is based generally on paragraph 115 _a_

and _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States

v. Toledo_, 15 M.J. 255 (C.M.A. 1983). It parallels the procedures

for production of witnesses. Discovery and introduction of classified or

other government information is covered by Mil. R. Evid. 505 and 506. Note

that unlike the standards for production of witnesses, there is no difference

in the standards for production of evidence on the merits and at sentencing.

The relaxation of the rules of evidence at presentencing proceedings provides

some flexibility as to what evidence must be produced at those proceedings.

## Rule 704. Immunity

### (a) Types of immunity.

This subsection recognizes both transactional and testimonial or

use immunity. _See Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy_, 459 U.S. 248

(1983); _Kastigar v. United States_, 406 U.S. 441 (1972); _

Murphy v. Waterfront Commission_, 378 U.S. 52 (1964). _ See

also_ 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 6001-6005; _United

States v.  Villines_, 13 M.J. 46 (C.M.A. 1982). _See generally

_ H. Moyer, _Justice and the  Military_ 376-381

(1972); Green, _Grants of Immunity and Military Law, 1971-1976

_, 73 Mil. L. Rev. 1 (1976) (hereinafter cited as Green II); Green,_

Grants of Immunity and Military Law_, 53  Mil. L. Rev. 1 (1971) (hereinafter

 cited as Green I). 

 Paragraph 68 _h_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.) expressly recognized transactional immunity. It did not address

testimonial immunity. Nevertheless, testimonial immunity has been used in

courts-martial. _See United States v. Villines, supra; United States

v. Eastman_ , 2 M.J. 417 (A.C.M.R. 1975); _United States v.

Rivera_, 49 C.M.R. 259 (A.C.M.R.1974), _rev'd on other grounds

_, 1 M.J. 107 (C.M.A. 1975). _See also_ Mil. R. Evid.

301(c)(1). 

 Subsection (1) makes clear that transactional immunity

extends only to trial by court-martial. _See_ Dept. of Defense

Dir. 1355.1 (July 21, 1981). Subsection (2) is written somewhat more broadly,

 however. Use immunity under R.C.M. 704 would extend to a State prosecution.

 _Cf. Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, supra_. Moreover,

although a convening authority is not independently empowered to grant immunity

extending to Federal civilian prosecutions, use immunity extending to such

cases may be granted by a convening authority when specifically authorized

under 18 U.S.C.  &sect;&sect; 6002 and 6004. _See_ subsection

(c) and Analysis. 

 The second paragraph in the discussion is based

on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 6004. The third paragraph in the discussion is

based on _United States v. Rivera_, 1 M.J. 107 (C.M.A. 1975); _

United States v. Eastman, supra._ 

### (b) Scope.

This subsection clarifies the scope of R.C.M. 704. It is based on

the last clause in 18 U.S.C. &sect;  6002. Note that this rule relates

only to criminal proceedings. A grant of immunity does not extend to administrative

proceedings unless expressly covered by the grant. 

### (c) Authority to grant immunity.

This subsection is based on paragraph 68 _h_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.) and on _United States v. Kirsch_, 15 U.S.C.M.A.

84, 35 C.M.R. 56 (1964). _See also United States v. Villines,  supra.

Kirsch_ recognized codal authority for a convening authority  to

grant immunity (_see_ Articles 30, 44, and 60) and found implementing

Manual provisions to be a proper exercise of authority under Article 36.

(At the time _Kirsch_ was decided, the convening authority's

powers now contained in Article 60 were in Article 64.) The enactment of

18 U.S.C. &sect; &sect; 6001-6005 did not remove this

power. _See United States v. Villines, supra;_ Department of

 Justice Memorandum, Subject: Grants of Immunity by Court-Martial Convening

Authorities (Sept. 22, 1971) _discussed in Grants of Immunity_,

The Army Lawyer 22 (Dec. 1973). _See also_ Dept. of Defense

Dir. 1355.1 (July 21, 1981). _See generally _ Green I, _

supra_ at 27-35; H. Moyer, _ supra_ at 377-380.

The rule recognizes, however, that the authority under the code of a general

 court-martial convening authority to grant immunity does not extend to federal

prosecutions. _Id._ Consequently, the rule directs military

 authorities to 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 6001-6005 as a means

by which such immunity can be granted when necessary. The discussion under

subsection (1) offers additional guidance on this matter. _See_ the

penultimate paragraph of the Analysis of subsection (a) of this rule as

to the effect of a grant of immunity to state prosecutions. 

 The

rule makes clear that only a general court-martial convening authority may

grant immunity. _See United States v. Joseph_, 11 M.J. 333

(C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Caliendo_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 405,

32 C.M.R. 405 (1962); _United States v. Thompson_, 11 U.S.C.M.A.

252, 29 C.M.R. 68  (1960); _United States v. Werthman_, 5

U.S.C.M.A. 440, 18 C.M.R. 64 (1955). _Cf. Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy,

supra. Cooke v. Orser_, 12 M.J. 335 (C.M.A. 1982), is not to the

contrary. In _Cooke_ the majority found that due process required

 enforcement of promises of immunity under the facts of that case. One member

of the majority also opined that the convening authority could be held, on

the facts, to have authorized the grant of immunity. The limitations in subsection

(c)(3) and the procedural requirements in subsection (d) are intended to

reduce the potential for the kinds of problems which arose in _Cooke.

_ 

 The power to grant immunity and the power to enter into

a pretrial agreement, while related, should be distinguished. R.C.M. 704

does not disturb the power of the convening authority, including a special

 or summary court-martial convening authority, to make a pretrial agreement

 with an accused under which the accused promises to testify in another court-martial,

as long as the agreement does not purport to be a grant of immunity. Note

that the accused-witness in such a case could not be ordered to testify pursuant

to the pretrial agreement; instead, such an accused would lose the benefit

of the bargained-for relief upon refusal to carry out the bargain. _

See also_ R.C.M. 705. 

 The first paragraph in the initial

discussion under subsection (c) is based on _Cooke v. Orser_ and _

United States v. Caliendo,_ both _ supra_. As to the

second paragraph in the discussion, _see United States v. Newman_,

14  M.J. 474 (C.M.A. 1983). The discussion under subsection (c)(1) is based

on _Grants of Immunity_, The Army Lawyer 22 (Dec. 1973). _

of Understanding Between the Departments of Justice and Defense Relating

to the Investigation and Prosecution of Crimes Over Which the Two Departments

Have Concurrent Jurisdiction (1955). 

 As to whether the threat

of a foreign prosecution is a sufficient basis to refuse to testify in a

 court-martial notwithstanding a grant of immunity, _see United States

 v. Murphy_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 32, 21 C.M.R. 158 (1956). _See also

moot_, 397 U.S. 96 (1970); Green II, _supra_ at 12-14. _

But see In re Cardassi_, 351 F. Supp. 1080 (D. Conn. 1972); _

ed. 1972).  The Supreme Court has not decided the issue. _See Zicarelli

v. New Jersey State Commission of Investigation_, 406 U.S. 472 (1974).

### (d) Procedure.

This subsection is new. It is intended to protect the parties to

a grant of immunity by reducing the possibility of misunderstanding or disagreement

over its existence or terms. _Cf. Cooke v. Orser, supra._ 

 The

first paragraph in the discussion is based on _United States v. Kirsch,

supra._ 

 The second paragraph in the discussion is based

on _United States v. Conway_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 99, 42 C.M.R.

291 (1970); _United States v. Stoltz_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 461,

34 C.M.R. 241 (1964). _See also United States v. Scoles_,

14 U.S.C.M.A. 14, 33 C.M.R. 226 (1963); Green I, _supra_ at

20-23. 

 The last paragraph in the discussion is based on

Mil. R. Evid. 301(c)(2) and _United States v. Webster_, 1

M.J. 216 (C.M.A. 1975). 

### (e) Decision to grant immunity.

This subsection is based on _ United States v. Villines,

 supra_. Although there was no majority opinion in that case, each

judge recognized the problem of the need to immunize defense witnesses under

 some circumstances, and each suggested different possible solutions. The

rule addresses these concerns and provides a mechanism to deal with them.

Note that the military judge is not empowered to immunize a witness. If the

military judge finds that a grant of immunity is essential to a fair trial,

the military judge will abate the proceedings unless immunity is granted

by an appropriate convening authority. 

 _1993 Amendment.

_ Subsection (e) to R.C.M. 704 was amended to make the military practice

 for granting immunity for defense witnesses consistent with the majority

rule within the Federal Courts. _United States v. Burns_,

684 F.2d 1066 (2d Cir. 1982), _cert. denied_, 459 U.S. 1174

(1983); _United States v. Shandell_, 800 F.2d 322 (2d Cir.

1986); _United States v. Turkish_, 623 F.2d 769 (2d Cir. 1980), _

cert. denied_, 449 U.S. 1077 (1981); _United States v. Thevis

_, 665 F.2d 616 (5th Cir. 1982), _cert. denied_, 459

U.S. 825 (1982); _United States v. Pennell_, 737 F.2d 521 (6th

Cir. 1984); _United States v. Taylor_, 728 F.2d 930 (7th Cir.

1984); _United States v. Brutzman_, 731 F.2d 1449 (9th Cir.

1984); _McGee v. Crist_, 739 F.2d 505 (10th Cir. 1984); _

United States v. Sawyer_, 799 F.2d 1494 (11th Cir. 1986). The amended

rule conforms R.C.M. 704(e) with case law requiring the military judge to

consider the Government's interest in not granting immunity to the defense

witness. _See United States v. Smith_, 17 M.J. 994, 996 (A.C.M.R.

1984), _pet. denied_, 19 M.J. 71 (C.M.A. 1984); _

United States v. O'Bryan_, 16 M.J. 775 (A.F.C.M.R. 1983), _

pet. denied_, 218 M.J. 16 (C.M.A. 1984). 

 The majority

rule recognizes that an accused has no Sixth Amendment right to immunized

testimony of defense witnesses and, absent prosecutorial misconduct which

is intended to disrupt the judicial fact-finding process, an accused is

not denied Fifth Amendment due process by the Government's failure to immunize

a witness. If the military judge finds that the witness is a target for prosecution,

there can be no claim of Government overreaching or discrimination if the

grant of immunity is denied. _United States v.  Shandell, supra_. 

 The

prior military rule was based on _United States v. Villines, supra

_, which had adopted the minority view espoused in Government

of ___Virgin Islands v. Smith___, 615 F.2d 964 (3d Cir. 1980). This view permitted

 the court to immunize also a defense witness when the witness' testimony

was clearly exculpatory, was essential to the defense case and there was

no strong Government interest in withholding testimonial immunity. This rule

has been sharply criticized. _See, e.g., United States v. Turkish,

supra; United States v. Taylor, supra; United States v. Pennel, supra;

United States v. Zayas_, 24 M.J. 132, 137 (C.M.A. 1987) (dissenting

opinion by Judge Cox). 

 The current rule continues to recognize

that a military judge is not empowered to immunize a witness. Upon a finding

that all three prerequisites exist, a military judge may only abate the proceedings

 for the affected charges and specifications unless the convening authority

 grants immunity to the witness. 

## Rule 705. Pretrial agreements

 _Introduction._ This rule is new. The code does

not address pretrial agreements, and MCM, 1969 (Rev.) did not discuss them.

Pretrial agreements have long existed and been sanctioned in courts-martial,

however, _see United States v. Allen_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 504, 25

C.M.R. 8 (1957). _See generally Gray, Pretrial Agreements_,

37 Fed. Bar. J. 49 (1978). The rule recognizes the utility of pretrial agreements.

At the same time the rule, coupled with the requirement for judicial inquiry

in R.C.M. 910, is intended to prevent informal agreements and protect the

rights of the accused and the interests of the Government. _See also

Santobello v. New York_, 404 U.S. 257 (1971); Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e); _

 ABA Standards, Pleas of Guilty_ (1979). 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on _United States v. Allen, supra.

_ Only the convening authority may enter a pretrial agreement with

an accused. _See United States v. Caruth_, 6 M.J. 184 (C.M.A.

1979); _United States v. Johnson_, 2 M.J. 541 (A.C.M.R. 1976); _

United States v. Crawford_, 46 C.M.R. 1007 (A.C.M.R. 1972). _

See also United States v. Troglin_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 183, 44 C.M.R.

237 (1972). Pretrial agreements have long been subject to service regulations. _

 See, e.g._, A.F.M. 111-1, para. 4-8 (May 13, 1980);

JAGMAN Section 0114 (June 11, 1982). Subsection (a) expressly continues such

 authority. The discussion is based on Dept. of Defense Dir. 1355.1 (July

21, 1981). 

### (b) Nature of agreement.

This subsection recognizes the matters contained in pretrial agreements. _

See United States v. Cooke_, 12 M.J. 448 (C.M.A. 1982); _United

States v. Schaffer_, 12 M.J. 425 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States

v. Brown_, 12 M.J. 420 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Bertelson

_, 3 M.J. 314 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Allen, supra.

_ As to prohibited and permitted terms and conditions, _

see_ subsection (c) of this rule. This discussion under subsection

(2)(C) is based on _United States v. Cook, supra._ 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ The amendment to the Discussion accompanying R.C.M.

705(b)(2)(C), regarding reinstitution of offenses withdrawn or dismissed

pursuant to a pretrial agreement and the standard of proof required of the

government to withstand a defense motion to dismiss the reinstituted offenses,

is based on _United States v. Verrusio_, 803 F.2d 885 (7th

Cir. 1986).  Alternative procedures available in Federal civilian practice,

such as a motion by the government for relief from its obligation under the

agreement before it proceeds to the indictment stage (_see United

States v. Ataya_, 864 F.2d 1324, 1330 n.9 (7th Cir. 1988)), are

inapposite in military practice and thus are not required. _See generally

_ R.C.M. 801(a). 

### (c) Terms and conditions.

This subsection is intended to ensure that certain fundamental rights

 of the accused cannot be bargained away while permitting the accused substantial

latitude to enter into terms or conditions as long as the accused does so

 freely and voluntarily. Subsection (1)(B) lists certain matters which cannot

 be bargained away. This is because to give up these matters would leave

no substantial means to ensure judicially that the accused's plea was provident,

 that the accused entered the pretrial agreement voluntarily, and that the

 sentencing proceedings met acceptable  standards. _See United States

v. Mills_, 12 M.J. 1 (C.M.A.  1981); _United States v. Green

_, 1 M.J. 453 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v. Holland_,

1 M.J. 58 (C.M.A. 1975); _United States v. Care_, 18 U.S.C.M.A.,

40 C.M.R. 247 (1969); _United States v. Cummings_, 17 U.S.C.M.A.

376, 38 C.M.R. 174 (1968); _United States v. Allen, supra._ The

discussion under subsection (2) is based on _United States v. Holland,

supra._ The rule is not intended to codify _Holland_ to

the extent that _Holland_ may prevent the accused from giving

up the right to make any motions before trial. _Cf. United States

v. Schaffer, supra._ Subsection (1)(A) provides that any term or

condition, even if not otherwise prohibited, must be agreed to by the accused

freely and voluntarily. _Cf. United States v. Green, supra; United

States v. Care, supra._ 

 Subsection (2) makes clear that

certain terms or conditions are not included in subsection (1)(B) and are

 permissible so long as they are freely and voluntarily agreed to by the

accused. Since the accused may waive many matters other than jurisdiction,

in some cases by failure to object or raise a matter (_see_ R.C.M.

 905(e); Mil. R. Evid. 103(a)), or by a plea of guilty (_see_

R.C.M. 910(j) and Analysis), there is no reason why the accused should not

be able to seek a more favorable agreement by agreeing to waive such matters

as part of a pretrial agreement. Indeed, authorization for such terms or

conditions, coupled with the requirement that they be included in the written

agreement (_see_ subsection (d)(3) of this rule) prevents _

sub rosa_ agreements concerning such matters and ensures that a careful

judicial inquiry into, and record of, the accused's understanding of such

matters will be made. The matters listed in subsection (2) have been judicially

 sanctioned. As to subsection (2)(A), _see United States v.  Thomas

_, 6 M.J. 573 (A.C.M.R. 1978). _Cf. United States v. Bertelson,

supra._ Subsection (2)(B) is based on _United States v.

Reynolds_, 2 M.J. 887 (A.C.M.R. 1976); _United States v.

Tyson_, 2 M.J. 583 (N.C.M.R. 1976). _See also United States

 v. Chavez-Rey_, 1 M.J. 34 (C.M.A. 1975); _United States v.

Stoltz_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 461, 34 C.M.R. 241 (1964). 

 Subsection

(2)(C) is based on _United States v.  Callahan_, 8 M.J. 804

(N.C.M.R. 1980); _United States v. Brown_, 4 M.J. 654 (A.C.M.R.

1977). Enforcement of a restitution clause may raise problems if the accused,

despite good faith efforts, is unable to comply. _See United States

v. Brown, supra._ 

 Subsection (2)(D) is based on _

United States v. Dawson_, 10 M.J. 142 (C.M.A. 1982). Although the

post-trial misconduct provision in _Dawson_ was rejected, a

 majority of the court was apparently willing to permit such provisions if

adequate protections against arbitrary revocation of the agreement are provided.

 However, _see United States v. Connell_, 13 M.J. 156 (C.M.A.

 1982) in which a post-trial misconduct provision was held unenforceable

without detailed analysis. Subsection (D) provides the same protections as

revocation of a suspended sentence requires. _See_ R.C.M.

1109 and  Analysis. Given such protections, there is no reason why an accused

who has bargained for sentence relief such as a suspended sentence should

enjoy immunity from revocation of the agreement before action but not afterward.

Other decisions have suggested the validity of post-trial misconduct provisions. _

See United States v. Goode_, 1 M.J. 3 (C.M.A. 1975); _United

States v. Thomas, supra; United States v. French_, 5 M.J. 655 (N.C.M.R.

1978). _Cf. United States v. Lallande_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 170,

46 C.M.R. 170 (1973). 

 Subsection (2)(E) is based on _United

States v. Schaffer, supra; United States v. Mills, supra; United States

v. Schmeltz_, 1 M.J. 8 (C.M.A. 1975). Note that the list is not

exhaustive. The right to enlisted members may be waived, for example. 

 _

1991 Amendment:_ Subsection (2) was amended to clarify that either

side can propose the inclusion of the listed terms in a pretrial agreement.

This conforms to the amendment to R.C.M. 705(d). 

### (d) Procedure.

This subsection ensures that an offer to plead guilty pursuant to

a pretrial agreement originates with the accused, and that the accused freely

and voluntarily enters a pretrial agreement. At the same time it recognizes

 that a pretrial agreement is the product of negotiation and discussion on

both sides, each of which is free to refuse to enter an agreement and go

to trial. Subsection (1) is based on _ United States v. Schaffer, supra.

_ This subsection, together with the prohibition against terms not

freely and voluntarily agreed to by the accused and the requirement in R.C.M.

910 for an inquiry into the agreement, should prevent prosecutorial pressure

or improper inducements to the accused to plead guilty or to waive rights

against the accused's wishes or interest. _See United States v. Schaffer,

supra_ at 428-429. 

 Subsection (2) provides that

once plea discussions are initiated by the defense the convening authority

or a representative may negotiate with the defense. This recognizes that,

while the offer must originate with the defense, the specific provisions

in an agreement may be the product of discussions with the Government. _

Schaffer, Mills, and Schmeltz_ suggest that each term must originate

with the defense. R.C.M. 705 is consistent with this insofar as it requires

that the offer to plead guilty originate with the accused (subsection (d)(1)),

that the written proposal be prepared by the defense (subsection (d)(3)),

and that the accused enter or agree to each term freely and voluntarily

(subsection (c)(1)(A)). It is of no legal consequence whether the accused's

counsel or someone else conceived the idea for a specific provision so long

as the accused, after thorough consultation with qualified counsel, can

freely choose whether to submit a proposed agreement and what it will contain. _

See United States v. Munt_, 3 M.J. 1082 (A.C.M.R. 1977), _

pet. denied_, 4 M.J. 198 (C.M.A. 1978). 

 Subsection (3)

ensures that all understandings be included in the agreement. This is in

the interest of both parties. _See United States v. Cooke_,

11 M.J. 257 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v.  Lanzer_, 3

M.J. 60 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Cox_ , 22 U.S.C.M.A.

69, 46 C.M.R. 69  (1972). The last sentence is based on _United States

v. Green, supra._ Note that the rule does not require the convening

authority to sign the agreement. Although the convening authority must personally

approve the agreement, (_see_ subsection (a)) and has sole

discretion whether to do so under subsection (4), the convening authority

need not personally sign the agreement. In some circumstances, it may not

be practicable or even physically possible to present the written agreement

to the convening authority for approval. The rule allows flexibility in

this regard. The staff judge advocate, trial counsel, or other person authorized

by the convening authority to sign may do so. Authority to sign may by granted

orally. Subsection (3) is not intended to preclude oral modifications in

the agreement from being made on the record at trial with the consent of

the parties. 

 Subsection (5) makes clear that neither party is

bound by a pretrial agreement until performance begins. _See United

States v. Kazena_, 11 M.J. 28 (C.M.A. 1981). In _Shepardson

v. Roberts_, 14 M.J. 354 (C.M.A. 1983), the Court stated that the

convening authority may be bound by a pretrial agreement before entry of

a plea of guilty if the accused has detrimentally relied on the agreement.

The Court indicated, however, that not all forms of reliance by the accused

rise to the level of detrimental reliance as it used that term. Thus the

Court held in _Shepardson_ that exclusion of statements allegedly

made by the accused as a result of the agreement (but not necessarily pursuant

to it) was an adequate remedy, and enforcement of the agreement was not

required when the convening authority withdrew from it before trial. Similarly,

the Court opined that the fact that an accused made arrangements to secure

employment or took similar actions in reliance on an agreement would not

 require enforcement of a pretrial agreement. Subsection (5) is consistent

with this approach, but uses beginning of performance by the accused to

provide a clearer point at which the right of the convening authority to

withdraw terminates. Note that the beginning of performance is not limited

 to entry of a plea. It would also include testifying in a companion case,

providing information to Government agents, or other actions pursuant to

the terms of an agreement. 

 Note that the accused may withdraw

from a pretrial agreement even after entering a guilty plea or a confessional

stipulation, but, once the plea is accepted or the stipulation admitted,

could not withdraw the plea or the stipulation except as provided under R.C.M.

910(h) or 811(d). The fact that the accused may withdraw at any time affords

the accused an additional measure of protection against prosecutorial abuse.

 It also reflects the fact that the convening authority can retrieve any relief

 granted the accused. _See_ Article 63; _United States

v. Cook, supra._ 

 _1991 Amendment:_ R.C.M.

705(d) was amended to authorize either party to initiate pretrial agreement

negotiations and propose terms and conditions. The amendment does not change

the general rule that all terms and conditions of a pretrial agreement proposed

pursuant to this rule must not violate law, public policy, or regulation.

 Subparagraph (1) was eliminated and subparagraphs (2)-(5), as amended,

 were renumbered (1)-(4), respectively. This amendment is patterned

after federal civilian practice [_see Fed. R. Crim. P._ 11(e)]

 where there is no requirement that negotiations for plea agreements originate

 with the defense. In courts-martial the military judge is required to conduct

an exhaustive inquiry into the providence of an accused's guilty plea and

the voluntariness of the pretrial agreement. R.C.M. 705(c) ensures that certain

 fundamental rights of the accused cannot be bargained away. Furthermore

it can be difficult to determine which side originated negotiations or proposed

a particular clause. _Cf. United States v. Jones_, 23 M.J.

305, 308-309 (C.M.A. 1987) (Cox, J., concurring). 

### (e) Nondisclosure of existence of agreement.

This subsection is based on _United States v. Green, supra;

 United States v. Wood_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 57, 48 C.M.R. 528 (1974). _

See also_ R.C.M. 910(f); Mil. R. Evid. 410. 

## Rule 706. Inquiry into the mental capacity or mental responsibility of the accused

 This rule is taken from paragraph 121 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 Minor changes were made in order to conform with the format and style of

the Rules for Courts-Martial. _See also United States v. Cortes-Crespo

_, 13 M.J. 420 (1982); _United States v. Frederick_,

3 M.J. 230 (C.M.A. 1977); Mil. R. Evid. 302 and Analysis. The rule is generally

consistent with 18 U.S.C. &sect; 4244.  The penultimate paragraph

in paragraph 121 is deleted as an unnecessary statement. 

 _

1987 Amendment:_ Subsection (c)(1) was modified, in light of changes

to federal law, to allow the use of available clinical psychologists. _

See_ 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 4241, 4242, and 4247. Subsection

(c)(2) was revised to implement Article 50a, which was added to the UCMJ

in the "Military Justice Amendments of 1986,"

tit. VIII, &sect; 802, National Defense

 Authorization Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat.

 3905 (1986). Article 50a adopted some provisions of the Insanity Defense

Reform Act, ch. IV, Pub. L. No.  98-473, 98 Stat. 2057 (1984). _

See also_ Analysis of R.C.M. 916(k). The subsection dealing with

the volitional prong of the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code test

was deleted. Subsection (A) was amended by adding and defining the word "severe." _

See_ R.C.M. 916(k)(1); S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 229

(1983), _ reprinted in_ 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News

1, 231. Subsection (C) was amended to state the cognitive test as now set

out in R.C.M. 916(k)(1). 

 _1998 Amendment._ Subsection

(c)(2)(D) was amended to reflect the standard for incompetence set forth

in Article 76b, UCMJ. 

## Rule 707. Speedy trial

 _Introduction._ This rule applies the accused's

speedy trial rights under the 6th Amendment and Article 10, UCMJ, and protects

the command and societal interest in the prompt administration of justice. _

 See generally Barker v. Wingo_, 407 U.S. 514 (1972); _United

States v. Walls_, 9 M.J. 88 (C.M.A. 1980). The purpose of this rule

is to provide guidance for granting pretrial delays and to eliminate after-the-fact

 determinations as to whether certain periods of delay are excludable. This

rule amends the former rule, which excluded from accountable time periods

covered by certain exceptions. 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on _ABA Standards for Criminal

Justice, Speedy Trial_, 12-2.1, 12-2.2 (1986). The ABA

Standards set no time limit but leave the matter open depending on local

conditions. The basic period from arrest or summons to trial under _

The Federal Speedy Trial Act_, 18 U.S.C. &sect;  3161, is

100 days. The period of 120 days was selected for courts-martial as a reasonable

outside limit given the wide variety of locations and conditions in which

courts-martial occur. The dates of the events which begin government accountability

are easily ascertainable and will avoid the uncertainty involved in _

 Thomas v. Edington_, 26 M.J. 95 (C.M.A. 1988). 

 The

90-day rule previously established in R.C.M. 707(d) has been eliminated.

As such, the 120-day rule established in subsection (a) of this rule applies

to all cases, not just cases where the accused is in pretrial confinement.

Judicial decisions have held, however, that when an accused has been held

in pretrial confinement for more than 90 days, a presumption arises that

the accused's right to a speedy trial under Article 10, UCMJ has been violated.

In such cases, the government must demonstrate due diligence in bringing

the case to trial. _United States v. Burton_, 44 C.M.R. 166

(C.M.A. 1971). Unless _ Burton_ and its progeny are reexamined,

 it would be possible to have a _Burton_ violation despite

 compliance with this rule. 

 _2002 Amendment: Burton_ and

its progeny were re-examined in _United States v. Kossman_,

38 M.J. 258 (C.M.A. 1993), where the Court of Military Appeals specifically

overruled Burton and reinstated the earlier rule from _United States

v. Tibbs_, 15 C.M.A. 350, 353, 35 C.M.R. 322, 325 (1965). _

See Kossman_, 38 M.J. at 262. In _Kossman_, the Court

reinstated the "reasonable diligence" standard in determining

whether the prosecution's progress toward trial for a confined accused was

sufficient to satisfy the speedy trial requirement of Article 10, UCMJ. 

 The

discussion is based on _United States v. McDonald_, 456 U.S.

1 (1982); _United States v. Marion_, 404 U.S. 307 (1971). _

See also United States v. Lovasco_, 431 U.S. 783 (1977). Delay before

restraint or referral of charges could raise due process issues. _

See id.; United States v. McGraner_, 13 M.J. 408 (C.M.A. 1982). _

See generally_ Pearson and Bowen, _Unreasonable Pre-Preferral

Delay_, 10 A.F. JAG Rptr. 73 (June 1981). 

### (b) Accountability.

Subsection (1) is based on _United States v. Manalo_,

 1 M.J. 452 (C.M.A. 1976). The reference to R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4) conforms

 to the language of R.C.M. 707(a)(2). 

 Subsection (2) is based

on _ABA Standards, supra_ at 12-2.2(a) (1986). _

See also United States v. Talaveraz_, 8 M.J. 14 (C.M.A. 1979). 

 Subsection

(3)(A) establishes that a mistrial or dismissal by any proper authority begins

a new trial period. This subsection clarifies the date from which to begin

measuring new time periods in cases involving rereferral, restraint, or

no restraint. 

 Subsection (3)(B) clarifies the intent of this portion

of the rule. The harm to be avoided is continuous pretrial restraint. _

See United States v. Gray_, 21 M.J. 1020 (N.M.C.M.R. 1986). Where

an accused is released from pretrial restraint for a substantial period,

he will be treated the same as an accused who was not restrained. Therefore,

unless the restraint is reimposed, the 120-day time period will run from

the date of preferral or entry on active duty regardless of whether that

event occurs before or after the accused was released from restraint. 

 Subsection

(3)(C) clarifies the effect of government appeals on this rule. This subsection

treats all government appeals the same. Once the parties are given notice

of either the government's decision not to appeal under R.C.M. 908(b)(8)

or the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals under R.C.M. 908(c)(3),

 a new 120-day period begins. 

 This subsection clarifies how time

should be counted for those charges not affected by the ruling that is subject

to appeal. Under R.C.M. 908(b)(4), trial on such charges may in some circumstances

proceed notwithstanding the appeal, or trial may await resolution of the

appeal. Since the traditional policy of resolving all known charges at a

single trial has not changed (_see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(10), Discussion),

charges not the subject of the appeal may be properly delayed without violating

this rule. Accordingly where the trial is interrupted by a government appeal,

all charges may be treated the same and proceeded upon at the same time

once the appeal is resolved. 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ Subsection

(3)(D) was amended in light of _United States v. Becker,_ 53

M.J. 229 (2000), to clarify that the 120-day time period applies to sentence-only

rehearings. The amendment also designates the first session under R.C.M.

803 as the point at which an accused is brought to trial in a sentence-only

rehearing.

### (c) Excludable delays.

This subsection, based on _ABA Standards for Criminal Justice,

 Speedy Trial_, 12-1.3 (1986), follows the principle that the

government is accountable for all time prior to trial unless a competent

 authority grants a delay. _See United States v. Longhofer_,

29  M.J. 22 (C.M.A. 1989). The rule of procedure established in subsection

(1) is based on _United States v. Maresca_, 28 M.J. 328 (C.M.A.

 1989). _See also United States v. Carlisle_, 25 M.J. 426,

428 (C.M.A. 1988). 

 The discussion to subsection (1) provides

guidance for judges and convening authorities to ensure the full development

of speedy trial issues at trial. _See United States v. Maresca, supra.

_ This amendment follows ABA guidance and places responsibility on

a military judge or the convening authority to grant reasonable pretrial

delays. Military judges and convening authorities are required, under this

subsection, to make an independent determination as to whether there is in

fact good cause for a pretrial delay, and to grant such delays for only

so long as is necessary under the circumstances. _ ABA Standards, supra

_ at 12 -1.3; _United States v. Longhofer, supra._ Decisions

 granting or denying pretrial delays will be subject to review for both abuse

of discretion and the reasonableness of the period of delay granted. _

Id.; United States v. Maresca, supra._ 

 _1998 Amendment.

_ In creating Article 76b, UCMJ, Congress mandated the commitment

of an incompetent accused to the custody of the Attorney General. As an

accused is not under military control during any such period of custody,

the entire period is excludable delay under the 120-day speedy trial rule. 

_

 2004 Amendment:_ Subsection (c) was amended to treat periods

of the accused's unauthorized absence as excludable delay for purposes of

speedy trial. _See United States v. Dies,_ 45 M.J. 376 (1996).

 The Discussion was deleted as superfluous.

### (d) Remedy.

This subsection is based on _The Federal Speedy Trial Act

_, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3162. The Federal Rule provides dismissal

as the sanction for speedy trial violations but permits the judge to dismiss

with or without prejudice. Accordingly, this subsection permits the judge

to dismiss charges without prejudice for non-constitutional violations of

this rule. If, however, the accused has been denied his or her constitutional

 right to a speedy trial, the only available remedy is dismissal with prejudice. _

Strunk v. United States_, 412 U.S. 434 (1973). 

_ 2004

Amendment:_ Subsection (d) was amended in light of _United

States v. Becker,_ 53 M.J. 229 (2000), to provide for sentence relief

as a sanction for violation of the 120-day rule in sentence-only rehearings.

 The amendment sets forth factors for the court to consider to determine whether

or to what extent sentence relief is appropriate and provides for the sentence

credit to be applied to the sentence approved by the convening authority.

### (e) Waiver.

A lack of a demand for immediate trial will not constitute waiver

and will not preclude an accused from raising speedy trial issues at trial. _

See Barker v. Wingo, supra._ 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER VIII. TRIAL PROCEDURE GENERALLY

## Rule 801. Military judge's responsibility; other matters

### (a) Responsibilities of military judge.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 39 _b_ and

40 _b_(2) and the first sentence of paragraph 57 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It is intended to provide the military judge

or president of a special court-martial without a military judge broad authority

 to regulate the conduct of courts-martial within the framework of the code

and the Manual, and to establish the outlines of their responsibilities.

Much of the discussion is also derived from paragraphs 39 _b_,

40 _b_(2), and 53 _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

A few minor changes have been made. For instance, the military judge, not

the president, determines the uniform to be worn, and the military judge

is not required to consult with the president, nor is the president of a

special court-martial without a military judge required to consult with trial

 counsel, concerning scheduling. As a practical matter, consultation or coordination

among the participants concerning scheduling or uniform may be appropriate,

but the authority for these decisions should rest with the presiding officer

of the court, either military judge or president of a special court-martial

without a military judge, without being required to consult with others.

 _2015 Amendment_: R.C.M. 801(a)(6) was created to implement Section 1701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013.

### (b) Obtaining evidence.

This subsection is taken from paragraph 54 _b_ of

the MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Some of the language in paragraph 54 _b_ has

been placed in the discussion. 

### (c) Uncharged offenses.

This subsection is taken from paragraph 55 _a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is designed to accomplish the same purpose

as paragraph 55 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), although the language

 is no longer in terms which could be construed as jurisdictional. 

### (d) Interlocutory questions and questions of law.

This subsection is similar in substance to paragraph 57 of MCM,

1969 (Rev.) and is based on Articles 51(b) and 52(c). 

 Subsections

(1) and (2) are based on Articles 51(b) and 52(c). The provisions (R.C.M.

801(e)(1)(C); 801(e)(2)(C)) permitting a military judge or president of a

special court-martial without a military judge to change a ruling previously

made (Article 51(b)) have been modified to preclude changing a previously

 granted motion for finding of not guilty. _United States v. Hitchcock

_, 6 M.J. 188 (C.M.A. 1979). Under R.C.M. 916(k) the military judge

does not rule on the question of mental responsibility as an interlocutory

 matter. _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 916(k). Thus there are no

 rulings by the military judge which are subject to objection by a member. 

 Subsection

(2)(D) makes clear that all members must be present at all times during special

courts-martial without a military judge. The president of a special court-martial

lacks authority to conduct the equivalent of an Article 39(a) session. _

Cf. United States v. Muns_, 26 C.M.R. 835 (C.G.B.R. 1958). 

 Subsection

(3) is based on Articles 51(b) and 52(c) and is derived from paragraph 57 _

c, d, f_, and _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Some language

from paragraph 57 _g_ has been placed in the discussion. 

 Subsection

 (4) is taken from paragraph 57 _g_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The rule recognizes, however, that a different standard of proof may apply

to some interlocutory questions. _See, e.g._, Mil. R. Evid.

314(e)(5). The assignments of the burden of persuasion are determined by

specific rules or, in the absence of a rule, by the source of the motion.

This represents a minor change from the language in paragraph 67 _

e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which placed the burden on the accused for

most questions. This assignment was rejected by the Court of Military Appeals

in several cases, _see, e.g., United States v. Graham_,

22 U.S.C.M.A. 75, 46 C.M.R. 75 (1972). Assignments of burdens of persuasion

 and, where appropriate, going forward are made in specific rules. "Burden

of persuasion" is used instead of the more general "burden of

proof" to distinguish the risk of non persuasion once an issue is raised

from the burden of production necessary to raise it. _See McCormick's

Handbook of the  Law of Evidence_ &sect; 336 (E. Cleary

ed. 1972). For example, although the defense may have the burden of raising

an issue (e.g., statute of limitations), once it has done so the prosecution

may bear the burden of persuasion. 

 The discussion under subsection

(5) describes the differences between interlocutory questions and ultimate

questions, and between questions of fact and questions of law. It is taken,

substantially, from paragraph 57 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

As to the distinction between questions of fact and questions of law, _

see United States v. Carson_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 407, 35 C.M.R. 379 (1965).

The discussion of issues which involve both interlocutory questions and questions

determinative of guilt is based on _United States v. Bailey_,

 6 M.J. 965 (N.C.M.R. 1979); _United States v. Jessie_, 5

M.J. 573 (A.C.M.R.), _pet, denied_, 5 M.J. 300 (1978). It

is similar to language in the third paragraph of paragraph 57 _b

_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which was based on _United States v.

Ornelas_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 96, 6 C.M.R. 96 (1952). _See Analysis

of Contents, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969, Revised Edition

_, DA PAM 27-2, 10-5 (July 1970). That example, and

the decision in _United States v. Ornelas, supra_ were questioned

in _United States v. Laws_, 11 M.J. 475 (C.M.A. 1981). The

discussion clarifies that when a military offense (i.e., one which  requires

that the accused be a "member of the armed forces,"_

see_ Articles 85, 86, 99; _ see also_ Articles 88-91,

 133) is charged and the defense contends that the accused is not a member

of the armed forces, two separate questions are raised by that contention:

first, whether the accused is subject to court-martial jurisdiction

(_see_ R.C.M. 202); and, second, whether, as an element of the offense,

the accused had a military duty which the accused violated (e.g., was absent

from the armed forces or a unit thereof without authority). The first question

is decided by the military judge by a preponderance of the evidence. The

second question, to the extent it involves a question of fact, must be decided

by the factfinder applying a reasonable doubt standard. _United States

v. Bailey, supra. See also United States v. McGinnis_, 15 M.J. 345

(C.M.A. 1983); _United States v. Marsh_, 15 M.J. 252 (C.M.A.

 1983); _United States v. McDonagh_, 14 M.J. 415 (C.M.A. 1983).

Thus it would be possible, in a case where larceny and desertion are charged,

for the military judge to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the

accused is subject to military jurisdiction and for the members to convict

of larceny but acquit of desertion because they were not satisfied beyond

reasonable doubt that the accused was a member of the armed forces. 

 _

Ornelas_ does not require a different result. The holding in _

Ornelas_ was that the law officer (military judge) erred in failing

to permit the members to resolve a contested issue of the accused's status

as a servicemember on a desertion charge. Language in the opinion to the

effect that the "jurisdictional" issue should have been submitted

to the members is attributable to language in paragraph 67 _e_ of

MCM, 1951, which suggested that "defenses," including "jurisdiction,"

were to be resolved by the members. Such a procedure for resolving motions

to dismiss has been abolished. _See_ R.C.M. 905; 907; and

916. Thus the procedure implied by a broad reading of _Ornelas_ for

resolving jurisdiction is not required by the Manual. _See generally

United States v. Laws, supra. Cf. United States v. McDonagh, supra._ On

the other hand, when military status is an element of the offense, the fact

of such military status must be resolved by the factfinder. _Cf. United

 States v. McGinnis _and _United States v. Marsh_,

both _supra._ 

### (f) Rulings on record.

This subsection is based on paragraph 39 _c_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). Paragraph 39 _c_ did not include a reference

to rulings and instructions by the president of a special court-martial

without a military judge, nor was specific reference to them made elsewhere

in the Manual. Since such rulings and instructions are subject to the same

review as those of a military judge, the same standard should apply to both

at this stage. The rule is based on Article 54. The discussion refers to

R.C.M. 808 and 1103 to indicate what must be recorded at trial. Concerning

requirements for verbatim records, _see United States v. Douglas_,

1 M.J. 354 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v. Boxdale_, 22 U.S.C.M.A.

 414, 47 C.M.R. 351 (1973); _United States v. Weber_, 20 U.S.C.M.A.

82, 42 C.M.R. 274 (1970). 

### (g) Effect of failure to raise defenses or objections.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(f), except for the

 addition of the term "motions" to make clear that motions may

be covered by the rule and changes to conform to military terminology and

procedure. Such waiver provisions are more specifically implemented as to

many matters throughout the Rules. Several examples are listed in the discussion.

## Rule 802. Conferences

 _Introduction._ This rule is new. It is based on

Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.1, but is somewhat broader and more detailed. Fed. R.

Crim. P. 17.1 apparently authorizes, by its title, only pretrial conferences.

 Conferences other than pretrial conferences are also authorized in federal

 practice. _See_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(3); _Cox v.

United States_, 309 F.2d 614 (8th Cir. 1962). R.C.M. 802 applies

to all conferences. Nothing in this rule is intended to prohibit the military

judge from communicating, even ex parte, with counsel concerning routine

and undisputed administrative matters such as scheduling, uniform, and travel

arrangements. Such authority was recognized in the fourth sentence of paragraph

39 _ c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Like Fed. R. Crim.

P. 17.1, this rule provides express authority for what is already common

practice in many courts-martial, and regularizes the procedure for them.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.1 is designed to be used in unusual cases, such as complicated

trials. Conferences are needed more frequently in courts-martial because

 in many instances the situs of the trial and the home bases of the military

 judge, counsel, and the accused may be different. Even when all the participants

are located at the same base, conferences may be necessary. _See ABA

Standards, Discovery and Procedural Before Trial_ &sect; 11-5.4

(1978). After the trial has begun, there is often a need to discuss matters

in chambers. _ Cf._ Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c); _United

States v. Gregorio_, 497 F.2d 1253 (4th Cir.), _ cert. denied

_, 419 U.S. 1024 (1974). 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is taken directly from the first sentence of Fed.

R. Crim. P. 17.1, with modifications to accommodate military terminology.

Subsection (c) provides that a conference may not proceed over the objection

of a party and that, in effect, matters may be resolved at a conference only

by agreement of the parties. Thus, the military judge can bring the parties

together under subsection (a), but a conference could not proceed further

 without the voluntary participation of the parties. Nothing in this rule

is intended to prohibit the military judge from communicating to counsel,

orally or in writing, matters which may properly be the subject of rules

of court. _See_ R.C.M. 108; 801. This is also true under the

federal rule. _See Committee on Pretrial Procedure of the Judicial

Conference of the United States, Recommended Procedures in Criminal Trials

_, 37 F.R.D. 95, 98 (1965); C. Wright, _Wright's Federal Practice

and Procedure_ Para. 292 (1969). _Cf. United States v. Westmoreland

_, 41 F.R.D. 419 (S.D. Ind. 1967). 

 The discussion provides

some examples of the potential uses of conferences. As noted, issues may

be resolved only by agreement of the parties; they may not be litigated or

 decided at a conference. To do so would exceed, and hence be contrary to,

the authority established under Article 39(a). The prohibition against judicial

 participation in plea bargaining is based on _United States v. Caruth

_, 6 M.J. 184, 186 (C.M.A. 1979). _Cf. United States v. Allen

_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 504, 25 C.M.R. 8 (1957). _But, cf. ABA Standards,

 Pleas of Guilty_ &sect; 14-3.3(c) (1979). 

### (b) Matters on record.

This subsection is based on the second sentence in Fed. R. Crim.

P. 17.1. The federal rule requirement for a written memorandum was rejected

as too inflexible and unwieldy for military practice. The interests of the

parties can be adequately protected by placing matters on the record orally.

If any party fears that such an oral statement will be inadequate, that party

may insist on reducing agreed-upon matters to writing as a condition of

consent. In any event, a party is not prohibited from raising the matters

again at trial. _See_ subsection (c) below. 

 The

waiver provision has been added because the conference is not part of the

record of trial under Article 54. The purpose of the requirement for inclusion

in the record is to protect the parties, and therefore it may be waived. _

United States v. Stapleton_, 600 F.2d 780 (9th Cir. 1979). 

### (c) Rights of parties.

This subsection does not appear in the federal rule. It is intended

 to ensure that conferences do not become a substitute for Article 39(a)

sessions. In this respect Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.1 is broader than R.C.M. 802,

since the federal rule apparently includes "conferences" held

on the record and permits the parties to be bound by matters resolved at

the conference. _See_ C. Wright, _ supra_ at

Para. 292. 

 _1991 Amendment:_ The prohibition

against conferences proceeding over the objection of any party was eliminated

as it conflicted with the military judge's specific authority to order conferences

under section (a) of this rule and general authority to control the conduct

of court-martial proceedings. While the military judge may compel the attendance

of the parties, neither party may be compelled to resolve any issue or be

pressured to make any concessions. 

### (d) Accused's presence.

This subsection does not appear in Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.1. The silence

 of the federal rule on this matter has been controversial. _See_ Douglas,

J., dissenting from approval of Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.1 at 39 F.R.D. 276,

278 (1966). _See also_ 8 J. Moore, _Moore's  Federal

Practice_ Para. 17.1.02 [1]; 17.1.03 [3]

(1982 rev. ed.); Rezneck, _The New Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

_, 54 Geo. L. J. 1276, 1294-99 (1966); _ABA Standards,

Discovery and Procedure Before Trial_ &sect; 11-5.4(a)

(1978). The presence of the accused is not necessary in most cases since

most matters dealt with at conferences will not be substantive. The participation

of the defense in conferences and whether the accused should attend are matters

to be resolved between defense counsel and the accused. 

 Fed.

R. Crim. P. 43(c)(2) authorizes conferences concerning questions of law to

be held without the presence of the accused. The proceedings described in

Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(2) are analogous to those described in Article 39(a)(2),

since the judge may make rulings at a 43(c)(2) conference and such a conference

 is "on the record." Article 39(a) expressly gives the accused

the right to be present at similar proceedings in courts-martial. Because

of this inconsistency, Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(2) is not adopted. Questions

 of law may be discussed at a conference under R.C.M. 802, but the military

 judge may not decide them at such conferences. 

### (e) Admission.

This subsection is taken from the third sentence of Fed. R. Crim.

P. 17.1. 

### (f) Limitations.

This subsection is based on the last sentence in Fed. R. Crim. P.

 17.1, with the addition of the prohibition against conferences in special

courts-martial without a military judge. 

## Rule 803. Court-martial sessions without members under Article 39(a)

 Article 39(a) authorizes the military judge to call and conduct

 sessions outside the presence of members. The discussion contains a general

description, based on paragraph 53 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.),

of the types of matters which may be dealt with at Article 39(a) sessions.

The quoted language in the first paragraph of the discussion is found in

the legislative history of Article 39(a). _See_ S. Rep. No.

 1601, 90th Cong., 2nd Sess. 9-10 (1968). 

 The rule modifies

the language concerning Article 39(a) sessions after sentence is announced.

The former provision permitted such sessions only "when directed by

the appropriate reviewing authority." Yet paragraphs 80 _b

_ and _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) implied that a military

judge could call such a session on the judge's own motion. R.C.M. 1102 also

authorizes such action. 

 The first two paragraphs of the discussion

are based on the second and third paragraphs of paragraph 53 _d_(1)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), except that the present language omits "defenses"

from the matters a military judge may hear at an Article 39(a) session. Clearly

a military judge does not rule on the merits of a defense at an Article

39(a) session, and matters collateral to a defense which might be heard at

an Article 39(a) session are adequately described elsewhere in the discussion. 

 As

to the third paragraph of the discussion, _see_ Articles 35

and 39. _See also United States v. Pergande_, 49 C.M.R. 28

(A.C.M.R. 1974). 

## Rule 804. Presence of the accused at trial proceedings

 _Introduction._ Subsections (a) and (b) of

this rule are very similar to Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a) and (b). Subsection

 (c) is derived from paragraph 60 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)

 was not adopted since it is not compatible with military practice, as it

concerns corporate defendants, misdemeanor proceedings, conferences or arguments

upon questions of law, and sentence reduction proceedings. Of these, only

presence of the accused at conferences or arguments upon questions of law

has relation to military procedure. Article 39(b) would preclude absence

by the accused from arguments, except as provided in subsection (b). Conferences

are treated in R.C.M. 802. 

 Other differences between this rule

and Fed. R. Crim. P. 43 and paragraphs 11 and 60 of the MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

are discussed below. 

### (a) Presence required.

Article 39 establishes the right of the accused to be present at

all trial proceedings and Article 39(a) sessions. The right is grounded

in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the right to confrontation

 clause of the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution. This subsection is basically

the same as Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a) with modifications in language to conform

to military procedures. 

 The requirement that the accused be present

is not jurisdictional. While proceeding in the absence of the accused, without

the express or implied consent of the accused, will normally require reversal,

the harmless error rule may apply in some instances. _See United

States v. Walls_, 577 F.2d 690 (9th Cir.) _cert. denied_,

439 U.S. 893 (1978); _United  States v. Nelson_, 570 F.2d

 258 (8th Cir. 1978); _United States v. Taylor_, 562 F.2d 1345

 (2d Cir.), _cert. denied_, 434 U.S. 853 (1977). 

(b) _2007 Amendment_: Subsection (b) _Presence by remote means_, is new and inserted to implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 839 (Article 39, UCMJ) contained in Section 556 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, Pub. L. 109-163, 6 January 2006.  The amendment allows the presence of the accused at Article 39(a) sessions to be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, as prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned.

### (c) Continued presence not required.

This subsection is similar to Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b). Aside from

 modifications in terminology, two minor substantive changes have been made.

First, this subsection specifies that sentencing, as well as trial on the

merits, may take place when the accused is absent under this rule. Such a

construction is necessary in the military because delaying a sentence determination

increases the expense and inconvenience of reassembling the court-martial

and the risk that such reassembly will be impossible. Federal courts do not

face a similar problem. _See United States v. Houghtaling_,

2 U.S.C.M.A. 230, 235, 8 C.M.R. 30, 35 (1953). 

 The second change

substitutes the word "arraignment" for "the trial has commenced."

 This is a clearer demarcation of the point after which the accused's voluntary

absence will not preclude continuation of the proceedings. Since there

are several procedural steps, such as service of charges, which, while associated

 with the trial process, do not involve a session, the arraignment is a more

 appropriate point of reference. This is consistent with the previous military

rule. 

 The discussion points out that, although not explicitly

stated in this subsection (or Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b)), the accused may expressly

waive the right to be present at trial. Federal courts have so construed

Rule 43. _See_ 8 J. Moore, _Moore's Federal Practice

_, &sect; 43.02[2] (1982 rev. ed.): 

 [Rule

43] does not refer to express waiver of presence on the part of

felony defendants, although it includes such a provision for misdemeanants.

This omission was not intended to negate the right of felony defendants

expressly to waive presence at the trial, for the _Diaz_ case

 (_Diaz v. United States_, 223 U.S. 442 (1912)) cited as authority

for the "voluntary absence" provision itself involved an express

 waiver. [Footnote omitted.] 

 _See also

Snyder v. Massachusetts_, 291 U.S. 97, 106 (1934) (dicta); _

In re United States_, 597 F.2d 27 (2d Cir. 1979); _United

States v.  Jones_, 514 F.2d 1331 (D.C. Cir. 1975); _United

States v. Crutcher_, 405 F.2d 239 (2d Cir. 1968), _cert.

denied_, 394 U.S. 908 (1969); _Pearson v. United States_,

325 F.2d 625 (D.C. Cir. 1963); _Cross v. United States_, 325

F.2d 629 (D.C. Cir. 1963). Such waiver should be made expressly by the accused

in open court. _Compare Cross v. United States, supra, with Pearson

v. United States, supra._ Federal cases also establish that there

is no right to waive presence, _see, e.g., United States v. Durham

_, 587 F.2d 799 (5th Cir. 1979); _United States v. Fitzpatrick

_, 437 F.2d 19 (2d Cir. 1970). In_In re United States, supra

_, the court stated that there is a duty on the part of a defendant

in a felony trial to be present. 597 F.2d at 28. 

 Military cases

also recognize that an accused may expressly waive the right to be present, _

United States v. Blair_, 36 C.M.R. 750 (N.B.R. 1965), _rev'd

on other grounds_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 257, 36 C.M.R. 413  (1966). _

See e.g., United States v. Holly_, 48 C.M.R. 990 (A.F.C.M.R.  1974). _

Cf. United States v. Cook_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 504, 43 C.M.R. 344 (1971).

 Some earlier military cases indicated that accused's counsel could waive

the accused's right to be present. This is contrary to present authority. _

See United States v. Holly, supra._ 

 Subsection (1) is

similar to paragraph 11 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The language

in MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which indicated that an absence had to be unauthorized,

has been omitted. The language now conforms to the federal rule in this

respect. The term "unauthorized" has never been treated as significant. _

See United States v. Peebles_, 3 M.J. 177 (C.M.A. 1977). As the

 discussion notes in the fourth paragraph, a person who is in custody or

otherwise subject to military control cannot, while in such a status, voluntarily

be absent from trial without expressly waiving the right on the record and

receiving the permission of the military judge to be absent. _Cf.

United States v. Crutcher, supra._ This appears to be the treatment

that the term "unauthorized" was designed to effect. _

See United States v. Peebles, supra_ at 179 (Cook, J.). 

 Trial

in absentia, when an accused voluntarily fails to appear at trial following

arraignment, has long been permitted in the military. _United States

v. Houghtaling, supra._ Authority for the third and fourth paragraphs

of the discussion under _Voluntary absence_ is found in _

United States v. Peebles, supra. United States v. Cook, supra_ requires

that the voluntariness of an absence be established on the record before

trial in absentia may proceed. Because the prosecution will be the party

moving for trial in absentia, the discussion notes that the prosecution has

the burden to prove voluntariness as well as absence. The example of an

inference is taken from Judge Perry's separate opinion in _United

States v. Peebles, supra. Compare United States v. Partlow_, 428

F.2d 814 (2d. Cir. 1970) _with Phillips v. United States_,

334 F.2d 589 (9th Cir. 1964), _cert, denied_, 379 U.S. 1002

(1965). 

 Subsection (2) is the same as Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b)(2)

except for changes in terminology. The rule and much of the discussion are

based on _Illinois v. Allen_, 397 U.S. 337 (1970). The discussion

also draws heavily on _ABA Standards, Special Functions of the Trial

Judge_ &sect; 6-3.8 and Commentary (1978). With respect

to binding an accused, _see United States v. Gentile_, 1

M.J. 69 (C.M.A. 1975). _See also United States v. Henderson_,

 11 U.S.C.M.A. 556, 29 C.M.R. 372 (1960). 

### (d) Voluntary absence for limited purpose of child testimony.

 _1999 Amendment:_ The amendment provides for two-way

closed circuit television to transmit a child's testimony from the courtroom

to the accused's location. The use of two-way closed circuit television,

to some degree, may defeat the purpose of these alternative procedures, which

is to avoid trauma to children. In such cases, the judge has discretion

to direct one-way television communication. The use of one-way closed circuit

 television was approved by the Supreme Court in _Maryland v. Craig

_, 497 U.S. 836 (1990). This amendment also gives the accused the

election to absent himself from the courtroom to prevent remote testimony.

 Such a provision gives the accused a greater role in determining how this

issue will be resolved.

 _2007 Amendment_:  The specific terminology of the manner in which remote live testimony may be transmitted was deleted to allow for technological advances in the methods used to transmit audio and visual information.

### (e) Appearance and security of accused.

This subsection is similar to paragraph 60 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 In

subsection (1), the last sentence represents a modification of previous practice

by making the accused and defense counsel primarily responsible for the personal

appearance of the accused. Because of difficulties the defense may face

in meeting these responsibilities, the rule requires the commander to give

reasonable assistance to the defense when needed. The discussion emphasizes

the right (_see United States v. West_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 670,

31 C.M.R. 256 (1962)) and the duty (_see United States v. Gentile,

 supra_) of the accused to appear in proper military uniform. 

 Subsection

(2) reflects the changes since 1969 in rules governing pretrial restraint.

These rules are now found in the sections referred to by R.C.M. 804(c)(2).

Insofar as paragraph 60 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was a means of allocating responsibility

for maintaining (as opposed to authorizing) custody over an accused until

completion of trial, and insofar as this allocation is not mandated by other

rules in this Manual, the service secretaries are authorized to prescribe

rules to accomplish such allocation. 

 Subsection (3) is taken

verbatim from paragraph 60 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 805. Presence of military judge, members, and counsel

### (a) Military judge.

This subsection is based on paragraph 39 _d_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.).

 _2007 Amendment_:  R.C.M. 805(a) was amended to implement the statutory change to 10 U.S.C. Sec 839 (Article 39, UCMJ) contained in Section 556 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006.  The amendment allows the presence of the military judge at an Article 39(a) session to be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, as prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned.

 

### (b) Members.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 41 _c_ and

41 _d_(1) and (2) and the first sentence of the second paragraph

62 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on Article 29(c). _

See also United States v. Colon_, 6 M.J. 73 (C.M.A. 1978). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ References to R.C.M. "911" were changed

to R.C.M. "912" to correct an error in MCM, 1984. 

### (c) Counsel.

This subsection modifies paragraphs 44 _c_ and 46

 _c_ which required the express permission of the convening

authority or the military judge for counsel to be absent. The rule now states

 only the minimum requirement to proceed. The discussion noted that proceedings

 ordinarily should not be conducted in the absence of any defense or assistant

defense counsel unless the accused consents. The second sentence in the

discussion is based on _Ungar v. Sarafite_, 376 U.S. 575 (1964); _

United States v. Morris_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 319, 49 C.M.R. 653 (1975); _

United States v. Kinard_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 300, 45 C.M.R. 74 (1972); _

United States v. Hampton_, 50 C.M.R. 531 (N.C.M.R.), _pet.

denied_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 663 (1975); _ United States v. Griffiths

_, 18 C.M.R. 354 (A.B.R.), _pet. denied_, 6 U.S.C.M.A.

808, 19 C.M.R. 413 (1955). _ See also Morris v. Slappy_, 461

U.S. 1 (1983); _Dennis v. United States_, 340 U.S. 887 (1950)

(statement of Frankfurter, J.); _United States v. Batts_, 3

 M.J. 440 (C.M.A. 1977); 17 AM. Jur. 2d &sect;&sect; 34-37 (1964).

 _2007 Amendment_:  R.C.M. 805(c) was amended to implement the statutory change to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 839 (Article 39, UCMJ) contained in section 556 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006.  The amendment allows the presence of counsel at an Article 39(a) session to be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, as prescribed by Regulations of the Secretary concerned.

### (d) Effect of replacement of member or military judge.

This subsection is based on Article 29(b), (c), and (d) and on

paragraphs 39 _e_ and 41 _e_ and _f

_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). MCM, 1969 (Rev.) also provided a similar procedure

 when a member of a court-martial was temporarily excused from the trial.

This rule does not authorize such a procedure. If a member must be temporarily

absent, a continuance should be granted or the member should be permanently

excused and the trial proceed as long as a quorum remains. Trial may not

proceed with less than a quorum present in any event. This subsection provides

a means to proceed with a case in the rare circumstance in which a court-martial

 is reduced below a quorum after trial on the merits has begun and a mistrial

 is inappropriate.

  _2012 Amendment_. This subsection provides a means to proceed with a case in the rare circumstance in which a court-martial is reduced below a quorum after trial on the merits has begun and a mistrial is inappropriate.  However, proceeding under these circumstances may result in a violation of the accused's constitutional rights to due process. _See United States v. Vazquez_,  M.J.  (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2012).

 

## Rule 806. Public trial

 _Introduction._ This rule recognizes and codifies

the basic principle that, with limited exceptions, court-martial proceedings

will be open to the public. The thrust of the rule is similar to paragraph

53 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), but the right to a public trial

is more clearly expressed, and exceptions to it are more specifically and

more narrowly drawn. This construction is necessary in light of recent decisions,

 particularly _United States v. Grunden_, 2 M.J. 116 (C.M.A.

 1977). 

### (a) In general.

This subsection reflects the holding in _United States v.

 Grunden, supra_, that the accused has a right to a public trial

under the Sixth Amendment. _See also United States v. Brown_,

7 U.S.C.M.A. 251, 22 C.M.R. 41 (1956); _United States v. Zimmerman

_, 19 C.M.R. 806 (A.F.B.R. 1955). 

 Although the Sixth Amendment

right to a public trial is personal to the accused (_see Gannett

Co., Inc. v. DePasquale_, 443 U.S. 368 (1979)), the public has a

right under the First Amendment to attend criminal  trials. _Richmond

Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia_, 448 U.S. 555  (1980). The applicability

of these cases to courts-martial is not certain (_cf. Greer v. Spock

_, 424 U.S. 828 (1976); _In re Oliver_, 333 U.S. 257,

26 n. 12 (1948); _but see United States v. Czarnecki_, 10

M.J. 570 (A.F.C.M.R. 1980) (dicta)), especially in view of the practical

differences between civilian courts and courts-martial (i.e., courts-martial

do not necessarily sit at a permanent or fixed site; they may sit overseas

or at sea; and at remote or dangerous locations). Nevertheless the rule and

the discussion are based on recognition of the value to the public of normally

having courts-martial open to the public. This is particularly true since

the public includes members of the military community. 

### (b) Control of spectators.

Neither the accused nor the public has an absolute right to a public

 trial. This subsection recognizes the power of a military judge to regulate

attendance at courts-martial to strike a balance between the requirement

 for a public trial and other important interests. 

 As the discussion

notes, the right to public trial may be violated by less than total exclusion

of the public. _See United States v. Brown, supra._ Whether

exclusion of a segment of the public is proper depends on a number of factors

including the breadth of the exclusion, the reasons for it, and the interest

of the accused, as well as the spectators involved, in the presence of the

excluded individuals. _See United States ex rel. Latimore v. Sielaff

_, 561 F.2d 691 (7th Cir. 1977), _cert, denied_, 434

U.S. 1076 (1978); _United States ex rel. Lloyd v. Vincent_,

520 F.2d 1272 (2d Cir.), _cert. denied_, 423 U.S. 937 (1975). _

See also Stamicarbon v. American Cyanamid Co._, 506 F.2d 532 (2d

Cir. 1974). 

 The third paragraph in the discussion of Rule 805(b)

is based on _United States v. Grunden, supra._ 

 Judicial

authority to regulate access to the courtroom to prevent overcrowding or

other disturbances is clearly established and does not conflict with the

right to a public trial. _See Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia,

supra_ at 581 n. 18. _Cf. Illinois v. Allen_, 397

U.S. 337 (1970). In addition, there is substantial authority to support

the example in the discussion concerning restricting access to protect certain

witnesses. _See, e.g., United States v. Eisner_, 533 F.2d

987 (6th Cir.), _cert. denied_, 429 U.S. 919 (1976) (proper

to exclude all spectators except press to avoid embarrassment of extremely

timid witness); _United States ex rel. Orlando v. Fay_, 350

F.2d 967 (2d Cir. 1965), _cert. denied_, 384 U.S. 1008 (1966)

(proper to exclude all spectators except press and bar to avoid intimidation

of witnesses); _United States ex rel. Latimore v. Sielaff, supra_ (proper

to exclude all spectators except press, clergy, and others with specific

interest in presence during testimony of alleged rape victim); _United

States ex rel. Lloyd v. Vincent, supra_ (proper to exclude spectators

in order to preserve confidentiality of undercover agents' identity). _

See also  Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, supra_ at 401-500

(Powell J.,  concurring); _United States v. Brown, supra; United States

 v. Kobli_, 172 F.2d 919 (3rd Cir. 1949). 

 Subsection

(b) authorizes closure of court-martial proceedings over the accused's objection

only when otherwise authorized in this Manual. Effectively, this means that

the only time trial proceedings may be closed  without the consent of the

accused is when classified information is to be  introduced. _See

_ Mil. R. Evid. 505(j). Article 39(a) sessions may also be closed

under Mil. R. Evid. 505(i); 506(i); and 412(c). Some federal cases seem

to suggest that criminal proceedings may be closed for other purposes. _

See, e.g., United States ex rel. Lloyd v. Vincent, supra._ Selective

exclusion of  certain individuals or groups for good cause, under the first

clause of this subsection, is a more appropriate and less constitutionally

questionable method for dealing with the problems treated in such cases. 

 Court-martial

proceedings may be closed when the accused does not object. As noted in the

discussion, however, such closure should not automatically be granted merely

because the defense requests or acquiesces in it. _See Richmond Newspapers,

Inc., v. Virginia, supra. See also Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, supra.

_ 

 With respect to methods of dealing with the effect of

publicity on criminal trials, as treated in the discussion, _see

Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart_, 427 U.S. 539 (1976); _

Sheppard v. Maxwell_, 384 U.S. 333 (1966); _Rideau v. Louisiana

_, 373 U.S. 723 (1963); _Irvin v. Dowd_, 366 U.S.

717 (1961); _United States v. Calley_, 46 C.M.R. 1131 (A.C.M.R.), _

aff'd,_ 22 U.S.C.M.A. 534, 48 C.M.R. 19 (1973); _Caley v.

Callaway_, 519 F.2d 184 (5th Cir. 1975), _cert. denied_,

425 U.S. 911 (1976). _ See also ABA Standards, Fair Trial and Free

 Press_ part III (1972). 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ Subsection

(b) was divided to separate the provisions addressing control of spectators

and closure and to clarify that exclusion of specific individuals is not a

closure. The rules for control of spectators now in subsection (b)(1) were

amended to require the military judge to articulate certain findings on the

record prior to excluding specific spectators. _See United States

v. Short,_ 41 M.J. 42 (1994). The rules on closure now in subsection

(b)(2) and the Discussion were amended in light of military case law that

has applied the Supreme Court's constitutional test for closure to courts-martial.

 _See ABC, Inc. v. Powell,_ 47 M.J. 363 (1997); _United

States v. Hershey, _20 M.J. 433 (C.M.A. 1985); _United States

v. Grunden,_ 2 M.J. 116 (C.M.A. 1977).

 _2015 Amendment_: R.C.M. 806(b)(2) was revised to implement Article 6b(a)(2), Article 6b(a)(3), and Article 6b(a)(5), UCMJ, as created by Section 1701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013.

### (c) Photography and broadcasting prohibited.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 53, and is consistent

 with paragraph 53 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and practice thereunder. _

See_ C. Wright, _Wright's Federal Practice and  Procedure

_ &sect; 861 (1969); 8 _B_ J. Moore, _

Moore's Federal Practice_ Para. 53.02 (1982 rev. ed.). The

exception which authorizes contemporaneous transmission of the proceedings

to another room (e.g., by closed circuit television) has been added to the

language of the federal rule. Many military courtrooms have limited space,

and such methods have been used to accommodate the accused's and the public's

interest in attendance at courts-martial, as in the case of _United

States v.  Garwood_, NMC 81-1982 (1981). The Working Group

considered the constitutional alternatives identified in _Chandler

v. Florida_, 449 U.S. 560 (1981), but determined that Article 36

requires adherence to the federal rule except to the extent described. As

to the matters in the discussion, _see Amsler v. United States_,

381 F.2d 37 (9th Cir. 1967). 

 _2002 Amendment:_ Section

(d) was added to codify the military judge's power to issue orders limiting

trial participants' extrajudicial statements in appropriate cases. _

See United States v. Garwood_, 16 M.J. 863, 868 (N.M.C.M.R. 1983)

(finding military judge was justified in issuing restrictive order prohibiting

extrajudicial statements by trial participants), _ aff'd on other grounds

_, 20 M.J. 148 (C.M.A. 1985), _cert. denied_, 474

U.S. 1005 (1985); _United States v. Clark_, 31 M.J. 721,

724 (A.F.C.M.R. 1990) (suggesting, but not deciding, that the military judge

properly limited trial participants' extrajudicial statements). 

 The

public has a legitimate interest in the conduct of military justice proceedings.

Informing the public about the operations of the criminal justice system

is one of the "core purposes" of the First Amendment. In the

appropriate case where the military judge is considering issuing a protective

order, absent exigent circumstances, the military judge must conduct a hearing

prior to issuing such an order. Prior to such a hearing the parties will

have been provided notice. At the hearing, all parties will be provided

an opportunity to be heard. The opportunity to be heard may be extended to

representatives of the media in the appropriate case. 

 Section

(d) is based on the first Recommendation Relating to the Conduct of Judicial

Proceedings in Criminal Cases, included in the Revised Report of the Judicial

Conference Committee on the Operation of the Jury System on the "Free

Press--Fair Trial" Issue, 87 F.R.D. 519, 529 (1980), which was approved

by the Judicial Conference of the United States on September 25, 1980. The

requirement that the protective order be issued in writing is based on Rule

for Courts-Martial 405(g)(6). Section (d) adopts a "substantial likelihood

of material prejudice" standard in place of the Judicial Conference

recommendation of a "likely to interfere" standard. The Judicial

Conference's recommendation was issued before the Supreme Court's decision

in _Gentile v. State Bar of Nev._, 501 U.S. 1030 (1991). _

Gentile_, which dealt with a Rule of Professional Conduct governing

 extrajudicial statements, indicates that a lawyer may be disciplined for

 making statements that present a substantial likelihood of material prejudice

to an accused's right to a fair trial. While the use of protective orders

is distinguishable from limitations imposed by a bar's ethics rule, the _

 Gentile_ decision expressly recognized that the "speech of

lawyers representing clients in pending cases may be regulated under a less

 demanding standard than that established for regulation of the press in _

Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart_, 427 U.S. 539 (1976), and the cases

which preceded it." 501 U.S. at 1074. The Court concluded that "the

 substantial likelihood of material prejudice' standard constitutes

a constitutionally permissible balance between the First Amendment rights

of attorneys in pending cases and the State's interest in fair trials."

 _Id. _ at 1075. _Gentile_ also supports the

 constitutionality of restricting communications of non-lawyer participants

in a court case. _Id. _ at 1072-73 (_citing Seattle

 Times Co. v. Rhinehart_, 467 U.S. 20, 32-33 (1984)). Accordingly,

a protective order issued under the "substantial likelihood of material

prejudice" standard is constitutionally permissible. 

 The

first sentence of the discussion is based on the committee comment to the

Recommendations Relating to the Conduct of Judicial Proceedings in Criminal

Cases. _See_ 87 F.R.D. at 530. For a definition of "party," _

see_ R.C.M. 103(16). The second sentence of the discussion is based

on the first of the Judicial Conference's recommendations concerning special

orders. _See_ 87 F.R.D. at 529. The third sentence of the

discussion is based on the second of the Judicial Conference's recommendations,

 _id._ at 532, and on _United States v. Salameh_,

992 F.2d 445, 447 (2d Cir. 1993) (_per curiam_), and _

In re Application of Dow Jones & Co._, 842 F.2d 603, 611 &

n.1 (2d Cir.), _cert. denied_, 488 U.S. 946 (1988). The fourth

sentence is based on _ Salameh_, 992 F.2d at 447. The fifth

sentence is based on Rule for Courts-Martial 905(d). 

## Rule 807. Oaths

### (a) Definition.

This rule and the discussion are taken from paragraph 112 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Fed. R. Crim. P.

54(c). 

### (b) Oaths in courts-martial.

Subsection (1) including the discussion is based on Article 42 and

is based on paragraph 112 _b_ and _c_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). Subsection (2) is taken from paragraph 112 _d_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is taken in part from paragraph 112 _

d_ and in part from paragraph 114 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The oath

for questioning members has been combined with the oath concerning performance

of duties for administrative convenience and to impress upon the members

the significance of voir dire. The reference in paragraph 112 _a

_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), to Article 135 has been deleted. The oaths

for preferral of charges, and witnesses at Article 32 investigations and

depositions are contained in the discussion of applicable rules. 

## Rule 808. Record of trial

 The primary purpose of this rule is to highlight for participants

at the trial stage the requirements for the record of trial. The discussion

is based on paragraph 82 _a, b_, and _h_,

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Eichenlaub_,

11 M.J. 239 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. McCullah_, 11

M.J. 234 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Boxdale_, 22 U.S.C.M.A.

414, 47 C.M.R. 351 (1973); _United States v. Bielecki_, 21

U.S.C.M.A. 450, 45 C.M.R. 224 (1972); _United States v. DeWayne_,

7 M.J. 755 (A.C.M.R.), _pet. denied_, 8 M.J. 25 (1979); _

United States v. Hensley_, 7 M.J. 740 (A.F.C.M.R.), _pet.

 denied_, 8 M.J. 42 (1979); _United States v. Pearson_,

6 M.J. 953 (A.C.M.R.), _pet. denied_, 7 M.J. 164 (1979).

The preparation, authentication, and disposition of records of trial are covered

in Chapter XI. The administrative responsibility of trial counsel to prepare

the record is codal. Article 38(a). _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(b).

## Rule 809. Contempt proceedings

### (a) In general.

This subsection restates codal authority. The discussion is based

on paragraph 118 _a_ of MCM 1969 (Rev.). The language of

 Article 48 applies only to "direct" contempts. _See

_ W. Winthrop, _Military Law and Precedents_ 301-302

(2d ed. 1920 reprint); paragraph 101 of MCM, 1928; paragraph 109 of MCM

(Army), 1949; paragraph 118 _a_ of MCM, 1951; paragraph

118 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The definition of a "direct"

contempt is also based on these sources. _See also_ 8B J.

Moore, _Moore's  Federal Practice_ Para. 42.02[3]

(1982 rev. ed); 18  U.S. &sect; 401; _cf. Ex parte Savin_,

131 U.S. 267, witnessed by the court and other direct contempts is based

on _Cooke v. United States_, 267 U.S. 517 (1925), and is

important for procedural purposes. _ See_ subsection (b) below.

### (b) Method of disposition.

The subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 42. By its terms, Article

 48 makes punishable contemptuous behavior which, while not directly witnessed

by the court-martial, disturbs its proceedings (e.g., a disturbance in the

waiting room). As Fed. R. Crim. P. 42(b) recognizes, this type of contempt

may not be punished summarily. _See Johnson v. Mississippi_,

403 U.S. 212 (1971); _Cooke v. United States, supra._ Paragraph

118 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) did not adequately distinguish these types of contempt.

There may be technical and practical problems associated with proceeding

under subsection (b)(2) but the power to do so appears to exist under Article

48. 

### (c) Procedure; who may punish for contempt.

This subsection prescribes different procedures for punishment for

 contempt when members are or are not present. The Working Group examined

the possibility of vesting contempt power solely in the military judge;

but Article 48 provides that "court[s]-martial"

may punish for contempt. When members are  present, the military judge is

not the court-martial. _See_ Article 16. When trial by military

judge alone is requested and approved, the military judge is the court-martial.

 Under Article 39(a) the military judge may "call the court into

session without the presence of the members," and the military judge

therefore acts as the court-martial within the meaning of Article 16 and

48. Since Article 48 authorizes summary punishment for contempt committed

in the presence of the court-martial (_see Hearings of H. R. 2498

Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services_, 81st Cong.,

1st Sess. 1060  (1949)), its purpose would be destroyed by requiring members

who were not present and did not observe the behavior to decide the matter.

The second sentence in subsection (c)(1) parallels Fed. R. Crim. P. 42(a). 

 The

procedure for contempt proceedings before members has been simplified to

the extent possible consistent with the requirement for the members to decide

the issue. The procedure for a preliminary ruling by the military judge

to decide as a matter of law that no contempt has occurred is expressly recognized

 for the first time. _See_ Article 51(b). The requirement for

a two-thirds vote on findings and punishment is based on Article 52(a) and

(b)(3). 

### (d) Record; review.

This subsection is based on the eighth paragraph of paragraph 118

 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) concerning the record and post-trial

action. The requirement for approval and execution of the sentence by the

 convening authority is based on previous practice. _See_ W.

 Winthrop, _supra_ at 301-312; paragraph 101 of MCM,

1928, paragraph 109 of MCM (Army) and  MCM (AF), 1949, paragraph 118 of MCM,

 1951; paragraph 118 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). This requirement

 also reflects the need of the command to control its assets. The last sentence

is also based on _Hearings on H. R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the

 House Comm. on Armed Services_, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 1060 (1949).

### (e) Sentence.

This subsection is based on Article 57 and paragraph 118 _

 b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It clarifies that the military judge may

delay announcement of a sentence to permit participation of the contemnor

 when necessary. Paragraph 118 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was

 ambiguous in this regard. 

### (f) Informing person held in contempt.

This subsection and the discussion are based on paragraph 118 _

 b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); it has been modified for clarity. 

 _

1998 Amendment_: R.C.M. 809 was amended to modernize military contempt

procedures, as recommended in _United States v. Burnett_,

27 M.J. 99, 106 (C.M.A. 1988). Thus, the amendment simplifies the contempt

procedure in trials by courts-martial by vesting contempt power in the military

judge and eliminating the members' involvement in the process. The amendment

also provides that the court-martial proceedings need not be suspended while

the contempt proceedings are conducted. The proceedings will be conducted

by the military judge in all cases, outside of the members' presence. The

military judge also exercises discretion as to the timing of the proceedings

and, therefore, may assure that the court-martial is not otherwise unnecessarily

disrupted or the accused prejudiced by the contempt proceedings. See _

Sacher v. United States_, 343 U.S. 1, 10, 72 S. Ct. 451, 455, 96

L. Ed. 717, 724 (1952). The amendment also brings court-martial contempt

procedures into line with the procedure applicable in other courts. 

## Rule 810. Procedures for rehearings, new trials, and other trials

 _Introduction._ This rule is based on Articles

 63 and 73. It concerns only the procedures for rehearings, new trials, and

other trials. Matters relating to ordering rehearings or new trials are

covered in R.C.M. 1107 and 1210. 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on paragraph 81 _b_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Composition.

This subsection is based on Article 63(b) and the seventh paragraph

 of paragraph 92 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). As to subsection

(3), _see also United States v. Staten_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 493,

 45 C.M.R. 267 (1972). 

### (c) Examination of record of former proceedings.

This subsection is based on paragraph 81 _c_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). 

### (d) Sentence limitations.

Subsection (1) is based on the second sentence of Article 63 and

its legislative history. _See_ H. R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong.,

1st Sess. 30 (1949) and paragraph 81 _ d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also United States v. Ball_, 163 U.S. 662 (1896); _ United

States v. Culver_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 141, 46 C.M.R. 141 (1973); _

United States v. Eschmann_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 64, 28 C.M.R. 288 (1959); _

United States v. Jones_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 532, 28 C.M.R. 98 (1959); _

United States v. Dean_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 721, 23 C.M.R. 185 (1957).

The provision (prohibiting advising members of the basis of the sentence

limitation) in the third paragraph of paragraph 81 _ d_(1)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) has been placed, in precatory language, in the discussion.

The prohibition was based on _United States v. Eschmann, supra. Analysis

of Contents, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969, Revised edition

_, DA PAM 27-2 at 15-2 (1970). The rationale of _

Eschmann_ is subject to reasonable challenge. _See United

States v. Gutierrez_, 11 M.J. 122, 125 n.3 (C.M.A. 1981) (Everett,

C. J., concurring in the result); _United States v. Eschmann, supra

_ at 67, 28 C.M.R. at 291 (Latimer, J., concurring in the result).

By placing an admonition against such instructions in the discussion, rather

than a prohibition in the rule, users are alerted to current decisional requirements

while the issue is left open to future judicial development. 

 _

1995 Amendment_: Subsection (d) was amended in light of the change

to Article 63 effected by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

Year 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-484, 106 Stat. 2315, 2506 (1992).  The

amendment reflects that subsection (d) sentencing limitations only affect

 the sentence that may be approved by the convening or higher authority following

the rehearing, new trial, or other trial. Subsection (d) does not limit

the maximum sentence that may be adjudged at the rehearing, new trial, or

other trial. 

 Subsection (2) is based on the last sentence of Article

63, as amended, Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209,

 &sect; 5(d)(2)(C), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

### (e) Definition.

This definition is taken from paragraph 81 _d_(2)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ paragraph 92 _b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 811. Stipulations

### (a) In general.

This subsection restates the first sentence of paragraph 54 _

 f_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Authority to reject.

This subsection affirms the authority of the military judge to

decline to accept a stipulation, as an exercise of discretion and in the

interest of justice. This authority was implicit in paragraph 54 _

f_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which suggested that stipulations should

not be accepted in certain circumstances. These examples are now included

in the discussion. _See also United States v. Cambridge_,

3 U.S.C.M.A. 377, 12 C.M.R. 133 (1953); _United States v. Field_,

27 C.M.R. 863 (N.B.R. 1958). 

### (c) Requirements.

This subsection makes clear that a stipulation can be received only

 with the consent of the parties. This consent must be manifested in some

manner before the military judge may receive the stipulation, although the

rule does not specify any particular form for the manifestation, as this

rests within the discretion of the trial judge. _United States v.

Cambridge, supra._ Although it is normally preferable to obtain

it, the express consent of the accused on the record is not always necessary

 for admission of a stipulation. In the absence of circumstances indicating

lack of consent by the accused (_see e.g., United States v.  Williams

_, 30 C.M.R. 650 (N.B.R. 1960)), the defense counsel's concurrence

in the stipulation will bind  the accused. _United States v. Cambridge,

supra._ If there is  any doubt, the accused should be personally

questioned. _See United States v. Barbeau_, 9 M.J. 569 (A.F.C.M.R.

1980). 

 The last three paragraphs of the discussion deal with

stipulation "which practically amount to a confession." Paragraph

54 _f_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), states that such a confession

"should not be received in evidence." Despite this admonition,

such stipulations were occasionally received in order to allow the defense

to avoid waiving certain issues by pleading guilty while saving the parties

the time and expense of a full trial when the accused's guilt, as a practical

if not legal matter, was conceded. _See, e.g., United States v. Rempe

_, 49 C.M.R. 367 (A.F.C.M.R. 1974). The Court of  Military Appeals

has approved this procedure, but only if an inquiry of the sort described

in the discussion is conducted. _United States v.  Bertelson_,

3 M.J. 314 (C.M.A. 1977). The definition of a stipulation which practically

amounts to a confession in the discussion is based on _Bertelson_,

along with _United States v. Schaffer_, 12 M.J. 425, 427-428

nn. 4.6 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Reagan_, 7 M.J.

490 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Aiello_, 7 M.J. 99 (C.M.A.

 1979); and _United States v. Long_, 3 M.J. 400 (C.M.A. 1977).

 These cases indicate that a stipulation practically amounts to a confession

 when it amounts to a _"de facto"_ plea of guilty,

 rather than simply one which makes out a _prima facie_ case.

The example in the discussion is taken  from _United States v. Long,

 supra._ 

### (d) Withdrawal.

This subsection is taken, substantially verbatim, from paragraph

54 _f_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), and restates current law. _

See also United States v. Daniels_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 52, 28 C.M.R. 276

(1959). 

### (e) Effect of stipulations.

This subsection modifies previous Manual rules in two respects.

 First, it states that a stipulation of fact is binding on the court-martial.

This is consistent with federal practice, _see e.g., Jackson v. United

States_, 330 F.2d 679 (8th Cir.), _cert. denied._ 379

U.S. 855 (1964), as well as the prevailing view in the vast majority of

states. _See_ 4 J. Wigmore, _Wigmore on Evidence_ &sect; 2590

(3d ed. 1940); 73 Am. Jur. 2d. _Stipulations_, &sect; 8

(1974); 83 C.J.S. Stipulations, &sect;&sect; 12-13 (1953). _

See also H. Hackfield & Co. v. United States_, 197 U.S. 442

(1905). Paragraph 154 _b_ of MCM, 1951, contained the following

 provision: "The court is not bound by a stipulation even if received.

For instance its own inquiry may convince the court that the stipulated

fact is not true." The provision was drawn  verbatim from paragraph

140 _b_ of MCM (Army), 1949, and of MCM(AF), 1949, and can

be traced to paragraph 126 _b_ of MCM, 1928. The Court of

Military Appeals questioned the validity of this provision in _United

States v.  Gerlach_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 383, 37 C.M.R. 3 (1966), but did

not have to resolve whether the court-martial was bound by a stipulation

of fact, since it held that the parties were. The above quoted language was

omitted from MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The analysis to the Manual does not explain

why. _See Analysis of Contents, Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969,

Revised Edition_, DA PAM 27-2 at 27-49 (1970). Despite

this omission, some courts-martial have apparently continued to apply the

earlier rule. _ See Military Criminal Law, Evidence_ DA PAM

27-22, AFP 111-8 at paragraph 6-2 (1975). There is no reason

not to follow federal practice on this matter. If the court-martial's "own

inquiry" indicates  that the stipulated facts may not be true, the

parties should be afforded the opportunity to withdraw from the stipulation

and to present evidence on the matter in question. 

 The second

change is in the treatment of stipulations of a document's contents. MCM,

1969 (Rev.), applied the same "observations" it made concerning

stipulations of facts to stipulations of documents' contents thus implying

that, by stipulating to a documents' contents, the parties agreed that

the contents are true. This may have been due to the treatment of admissions

concerning documents' contents as a matter of civil procedure in Federal

courts, _see_ Fed. R. Civ. P. 36 (1948) (since replaced by

 Fed. R. Civ. P. 36 (1970)); _see also Wigmore, supra_, &sect; 2596,

and the fact that stipulations of a documents' contents, like stipulations

of fact, are handed to the members of the court. Yet, it is clear that

the parties may stipulate that a document contains certain text or other

information, or that a given document is genuine, without necessarily agreeing

that the text or other information in the document is true. In this sense,

a stipulation as to a document's  contents is like a stipulation of expected

testimony, and the rule so treats it. 

 Otherwise, this subsection

essentially restates paragraph 54 _f_(1) and (2) of MCM, 1969

 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Bennett_, 18 U.S.C.M.A.

96, 39 C.M.R. 96 (1969) and _United States v. Gerlach, supra_ for

 further discussion of the effects of stipulations. If the parties fail to

object to inadmissible matters in a stipulation, this will normally constitute

a waiver of such objection. Mil. R. Evid. 103. _Cf. United States

v. Schell_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 410, 40 C.M.R. 122 (1969). _See

also Wigmore, supra_ at &sect; 2592. 

### (f) Procedure.

This subsection is based on the second paragraph in paragraph 54

 _f_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 812. Joint and common trials

 This rule is taken from paragraph 53 _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The rule itself substantially repeats the first sentence

in paragraph 53 _c_. The discussion refers to other rules

 dealing with joint or common trials, and includes the examples discussed

in paragraph 53 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It also incorporates

a statement on stipulations which appeared at paragraph 54 _f_(3)

 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), and a statement concerning severances from paragraph

61 _h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The rule does not change current

law. 

## Rule 813. Announcing personnel of the court-martial and accused

 This rule is based on paragraph 61 _c_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.) and is placed in Chapter 8 since the requirement for announcing

the presence or absence of parties usually recurs several times during the

 trial. The rule has been rephrased to acknowledge the responsibility of the

 military judge to ensure that the matters covered are reflected in the record.

Paragraph 61 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) required the trial counsel

to make these announcements. This rule leaves to the discretion of the military

 judge who will make the announcements. The importance of requiring such

announcements to be made on the record is emphasized in _United States

v. Nichelson_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 69, 39 C.M.R. 69 (1968). 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER IX. TRIAL PROCEDURE THROUGH FINDINGS

## Rule 901. Opening session

 _Introduction._ R.C.M. 901 through 903 set

out in chronological order the procedures to be followed before arraignment.

The order need not be followed rigidly. 

### (a) Call to order.

This subsection is based on the first sentence in paragraph 61 _

b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The purpose of the subsection is to establish

a definite point to indicate when a court-martial is in session. The first

paragraph in the discussion is taken from paragraph 61 _ a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), but the present provision has been expanded to include

comparing the record of the referral on the charge sheet with the convening

 orders to ensure that they are consistent. The other matters in paragraphs

61 _a_ and _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), are omitted

here as unnecessary. 

 The second paragraph in the discussion is

based on paragraph 58 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and serves

as a reminder of the Article 35 requirements. _See United States v.

Pergande_, 49 C.M.R. 28 (A.C.M.R. 1974). The failure to object is

normally a waiver of the statutory right. _United States v. Lumbus

_, 48 C.M.R. 613 (A.C.M.R. 1974). Because of the importance of the

right, however, the military judge should secure an affirmative waiver. _

See United States v. Perna_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 438, 4 C.M.R. 30 (1952); _

United States v. Pergande, supra._ 

### (b) Announcement of parties.

This subsection is based on paragraph 61 _c_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). Requiring an announcement is intended to guard against inadvertently

proceeding in the absence of necessary personnel and to ensure that the

record reflects the presence of required personnel. Failure to make the announcement

is not error if it otherwise appears that no essential personnel were absent.

### (c) Swearing reporter and interpreter.

This subsection and its discussion are taken directly from paragraph

 61 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (d) Counsel.

This subsection, except for subsection (4)(A) and (D), is based

on paragraphs 61 _e_ and _f_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). The qualifications of counsel and matters which disqualify counsel

are treated at R.C.M. 502(d) and are not repeated here. The subsection makes

clear that at trial the military judge is responsible for determining whether

counsel is disqualified, _Soriano v.  Hosken_, 9 M.J. 221

(C.M.A. 1980), and for seeing that appropriate action is taken. Of course,

if a detailed counsel is disqualified the responsibility will fall upon

the convening authority to rectify the problem. The discussion points out

that defects in the qualification of counsel are not jurisdictional. _

Wright v. United States_, 2 M.J. 9 (C.M.A. 1976). Subsection (4)(A)

has been added to conform to the requirements of _United States v.

Donohew_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 149, 39 C.M.R. 149 (1969). _Cf._ Fed.

R. Crim. P. 5(c). Subsection (4)(D) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 44(c) and _

United States v. Breese_, 11 M.J. 17 (C.M.A. 1981). _See

also United States v. Davis_, 3 M.J. 430 (C.M.A. 1977); _

United States v. Blakey_, 1 M.J. 247 (C.M.A. 1976); _United

States v. Evans_, 1 M.J. 206 (C.M.A. 1975). 

### (e) Presence of members.

This subsection is new. Its purpose is to eliminate unnecessary

 attendance by members. _Accord_ Article 39(a). 

## Rule 902. Disqualification of military judge

 _Introduction._ This rule is based on 28 U.S.C.

 &sect; 455, which is itself based on Canon III of the _ABA

Code of Judicial Conduct_, and on paragraph 62 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The

procedures prescribed by 28 U.S.C. &sect; 144 were not adopted. That

statute provides that whenever a party "files a timely and sufficient

affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal

bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such

judge shall proceed no further therein." This section does not establish

a different test from 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455 for disqualification

for prejudice or bias. Instead, 28 U.S.C. &sect; 144 provides a procedure

mechanism by which the disqualification determination may be made. _

United States v.  Sibla_, 624 F.2d 864 (9th Cir. 1980); _

see also Parrish v. Board of Commissioners of Alabama State Bar_,

524 F.2d 98 (5th Cir. 1975) (_en banc_), _cert. denied

_, 425 U.S. 944 (1976). 

 This procedure is not practicable

for courts-martial because of the different structure of the military judiciary

and the limited number of military judges. 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is, except for changes in terminology, identical

to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(a). _See also_ paragraph 62 _

f_(13) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Conley_,

4 M.J. 327 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Head_, 2 M.J.

131 (C.M.A. 1977). 

### (b) Specific grounds.

The stem and subsection (1) are, with changes in terminology, identical

to the stem and subsection (1) of 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(b). _

See also_ paragraph 62 _ f_(13) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 Note that any interest or bias to be disqualifying must be personal, not

 judicial, in nature. _Berger v. United States_, 255 U.S.

22 (1921); _Azhocar v. United States_, 581 F.2d 735 (9th

Cir. 1978), _cert. denied_, 440 U.S. 907 (1979); _

United States v. Lewis_, 6 M.J. 43 (C.M.A. 1978); _United

States v. Grance_, 2 M.J. 846 (A.C.M.R. 1976); _United States

v. Stewart_, 2 M.J. 423 (A.C.M.R. 1975). _See also United

States v. Lynch,_ 13 M.J. 394, 398, n. 3 (C.M.A. 1982) (Everett,

C.J. concurring). 

 Subsection (2) is based on paragraphs 62 _

f_(5), (6), and (11) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See United States

v. Goodman_, 3 M.J. 1 (C.M.A. 1977). These grounds are analogous

to the disqualifying activities in 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(b)(2). 

 Subsection

(3) is based on paragraphs 62 _f_(3), (4), (9), (10), and

(13) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 605; _

United States v. Cooper_, 8 M.J. 5 (C.M.A 1979); _United States

v. Bradley_, 7 M.J. 332 (C.M.A. 1979). The purpose of this section

is analogous to that of 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(b)(3). 

 Subsection

(4) is based on Article 26 and paragraph 62 _ f_(1) and (2)

and 62 _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev). The matters in 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(b)(4)

regarding financial interest in the proceedings are not of significance in

courts-martial. The remote possibility that a judge or a member of the family

might have a financial interest in the outcome of a court-martial is adequately

covered in subsection (5) of this rule. 

 Subsection (5) is taken

directly from 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(b)(5), with the added clarification

 that the interest in subsection (C) may be financial or otherwise. 

 The

discussion is based on 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(c). 

### (c) Definitions.

Subsections (1) and (2) are, with changes in terminology, identical

 to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(d)(1) and (2). Subsection (3) has been added

to clarify that the president of a special court-martial without a military

 judge is treated as any other member for purposes of qualifications and

challenges. _See_ R.C.M. 912. Subsection (3) of 28 U.S.C.

&sect; 455(d) is unnecessary. 

### (d) Procedure.

This section including the discussion is based on Article 41 and

 paragraph 62 _d, g_, and _h_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

### (e) Waiver.

This section is, with changes in terminology, identical to 28 U.S.C.

 &sect; 455(e). 

## Rule 903. Accused's elections on composition of court-martial

### (a) Time of elections.

This subsection is based on Articles 16, 18, 19, and 25. It is

similar to paragraphs 53 _d_(2)(c) and 61 _g_ and _

h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) insofar as it concerns the timing of requests

for enlisted members of trial by military judge alone. It parallels Fed.

R. Crim. P. 23(a). Section (b) of Fed. R. Crim. P. 23 is inapplicable in

the military, and the matters covered in Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(c) are covered

in R.C.M. 918(b). 

 Article 25 states that a request for enlisted

members must be made before the end of an Article 39(a) session, if any.

The first Article 39(a) session is appropriate to consider these matters.

Although the Court of Military Appeals has not decided the issue (_

United States v. Morris_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 319, 321, 49 C.M.R. 653,

655 n.2 (1975)), the Working Group concluded that this does not establish

a jurisdictional deadline. _Cf. United States v. Bryant_,

23 U.S.C.M.A. 326, 49 C.M.R. 660 (1975); _United States v. Morris,

 supra_ (Article 16 requirement that request be submitted before

 assembly is not jurisdictional). To permit greater flexibility, the military

judge is authorized to permit the defense to defer a request for enlisted

members until a later time. Such a request should be granted for good cause

only, bearing in mind the burden which it may impose on the Government. 

 A

request for trial by military judge alone should be made at the initial Article

39(a) session to simplify procedure and facilitate scheduling and preparation.

However, since Article 16 gives the accused a statutory right to wait until

assembly to request trial by military judge alone, subsection (2) allows

 automatic deferral of this request. 

 The discussion points out

the statutory limits on requesting enlisted members or trial by military

 judge alone. _See_ Articles 16, 18, and 25. 

### (b) Form of election.

This subsection is based on Articles 16 and 25. The amendment of

 Article 16 permits a request for trial by military judge alone to be made

orally on the record. Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209,

&sect; 3(a), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

### (c) Action on request.

This subsection is based on Articles 16 and 25. Subsection (2)(A)

is based on Article 16(1)(B) and on paragraph 53 _d_(2)(C)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It does not require an inquiry of the accused by the

 military judge, although, as the discussion points out, it is good practice

to do so, and failure to do so could be error if the record otherwise left

the accused's understanding of the rights in doubt. _See_ S.

Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1983); _United States v. Parkes

_, 5 M.J. 489 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Turner_,

20 U.S.C.M.A. 167, 43 C.M.R. 7 (1970); _United States v. Jenkins

_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 112, 42 C.M.R. 304 (1970). This is consistent with

prevailing federal civilian practice. _See, e.g., Estrada v. United

 States_, 457 F.2d 255 (7th Cir.), _cert. denied_,

409 U.S. 858 (1972); _United States v. Mitchell_, 427 F.2d

1280 (3d Cir. 1970); _United States v. Straite_, 425 F.2d

594 (D.C. Cir. 1970); _United States v. Hunt_, 413 F.2d 983

(4th Cir. 1969); _but see United States v. Scott_, 583 F.2d

362 (7th Cir. 1978) (establishing requirement for personal inquiry into

jury waiver in Seventh Circuit). _See generally_ 8AJ. Moore, _

Moore's Federal Practice_ Para. 23.03[2]

(1982 rev. ed.). 

 Subsection (2)(B) is based on Article 16(1)(B)

which makes trial by military judge alone contingent on approval by the

military judge. _See United States v. Morris, supra_ at 324,

49 C.M.R. at 658. The discussion is based on _United States v. Butler

_, 14 M.J. 72 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Ward_,

3 M.J. 365 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Bryant, supra._ 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (3) was amended to reflect clearly that

requests for trial by military judge alone need not be in writing. 

### (d) Right to withdraw request.

Subsection (1) is based on _United States v. Stipe_,

 23 U.S.C.M.A. 11, 48 C.M.R. 267 (1974). 

 Subsection (2) is based

on the fifth sentence of paragraph 39 _e_ and on paragraph

53 _d_ (2)(b) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), and current practice.

### (e) Untimely requests.

This subsection is based on Articles 16 and 25, and _United

 States v. Jeanbaptiste_, 5 M.J. 374 (C.M.A. 1978); _United

States v. Thorpe_, 5 M.J. 186 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States

 v. Wright_, 5 M.J. 106 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v.

Bryant, supra. See also United States v.  Holmen_, 586 F.2d 322 (4th

Cir. 1978). 

 Despite dicta in_United States v. Bryant,

supra_ at 328, 49 C.M.R. at 662 n. 2, that withdrawal must be in

writing, the rule prescribes no format for withdrawal. _Cf._ Article

16(1)(B), as amended, _see_ Military Justice Act of 1983,

Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 3(a), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

 _

1987 Amendment:_ Subsections (b)(1), (c)(1) and (c)(3) were amended

to reflect an amendment to Article 25(c)(1) UCMJ, in the "Military

Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII, &sect; 803, National

Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub. L. No.  99-661,

100 Stat. 3905 (1986). _See_ Analysis R.C.M. 503. 

## Rule 904. Arraignment

 This rule is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 10 and paragraph 65

 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence of Fed. R. Crim.

P. 10 has been deleted as unnecessary since in military practice the accused

 will have been served with charges before arraignment. Article 35; R.C.M.

602. the discussion is based on paragraph 65 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 905. Motions generally

 _Introduction._ This rule is based generally

on Fed. R. Crim. P. 12 and 47 and paragraphs 66 and 67 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Specific similarities and differences are discussed below. 

### (a) Definitions and form.

The first sentence of this subsection is taken from the first sentence

of paragraph 66 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It is consistent

with the first sentence of Fed. R. Crim. P. 47 and the second sentence of

Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(a). The second sentence is based on the second sentence

of paragraph 67 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), although to be consistent

 with Federal practice (_see_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b) (second

 sentence) and 47 (second sentence)) express authority for the military judge

to exercise discretion over the form of motions has been added. The third

sentence is based on the third sentence of Fed. R. Crim. P. 47 and is consistent

with the first sentence of paragraph 67 _c_ and the fourth

 sentence of paragraph 69 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The last

sentence in this subsection is based on the third sentence of paragraph

67 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Although no parallel provision

appears in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this standard is similar

to federal practice. _See Marteney v. United States_ , 216

F.2d 760 (10th Cir. 1954); _United States v. Rosenson_, 291

F. Supp. 867 (E.D. La. 1968), _affd_, 417 F.2d 629 (5th

Cir. 1969); _cert. denied_, 397 U.S. 962 (1970). The last

 sentence in Fed. R. Crim. P. 47, allowing a motion to be supported by affidavit,

is not included here. _ See_ subsection (h) of this rule and

Mil. R. Evid. 104(a). _See generally_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 47 _

Notes Of Advisory Committee on Rules_ n. 3. 

### (b) Pretrial motions.

This subsection, except for subsection (6), is based on Fed. R.

Crim. P. 12(b). Subsections (1) and (2) have been modified to conform to

military practice and are consistent with the first two sentences of paragraph

67 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (3) is consistent

with Mil. R. Evid. 304(d)(2)(A); 311(d)(2)(A); 321(c)(2)(A). The discussion

is based on paragraph 69A of MCM, 1969 (rev.). Subsection (4) is new. _

See_ R.C.M. 701; 703; 1001(e). Subsection (5) is also new. Subsection

(6) is based on paragraphs 46 _d_ and 48 _b_(4)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and_United States v. Redding_, 11 M.J.

100 (C.M.A. 1981). 

### (c) Burden of proof.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 57 _g_(1)

and 67 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The assignment of the burden

of persuasion to the moving party is a minor change from the language in

paragraph 67 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which placed the burden

on the accused "generally." The effect is basically the same,

however, since the former rule probably was intended to apply to motions

made by the accused. _See also United States v. Graham_, 22

U.S.C.M.A. 75, 46 C.M.R. 75 (1972). The exceptions to this general rule

in subsection (B) are based on paragraphs 68 _b_ (1), 68 _

c_, and 215 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

United States v. McCarthy_, 2 M.J. 26, 28 n. 1 (C.M.A. 1976); _

United States v. Graham, supra; United States v.  Garcia_, 5 U.S.C.M.A.

88, 17 C.M.R. 88 (1954). The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are silent

on burdens of proof. 

 Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(c) is not adopted. This

is because in courts-martial, unlike civilian practice, arraignment does

not necessarily, or even ordinarily, occur early in the criminal process.

In courts-martial, arraignment usually occurs only a short time before trial

and in many cases it occurs the same day as trial. Because of this, requiring

a motions date after arraignment but before trial is not appropriate, at

least as a routine matter. Instead, entry of pleas operates, in the absence

of good cause, as the deadline for certain motions. A military judge could,

subject to subsections (d) and (e), schedule an Article 39(a) session (_

see_ R.C.M. 803) for the period after pleas are entered but before

trial to hear motions. 

### (d) Ruling on motions.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(e). It is consistent

 with the first sentence in paragraph 67 _e_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). The admonition in the second sentence of that paragraph has been

deleted as unnecessary. The discussion is based on the third paragraph of

paragraph 67 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

1991 Amendment:_ The discussion was amended to reflect the change

to R.C.M. 908(b)(4). 

### (e) Effect of failure to raise defenses or objections.

The first two sentences in the subsection are taken from Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(f) and are consistent with paragraph 67 _b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The third sentence is based on paragraph 67 _a_

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly

 provide for waiver of motions other than those listed in Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b). (_But see_ 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3162(a)(2) which

 provides that failure by the accused to move for dismissal on grounds of

 denial of speedy trial before trial or plea of guilty constitutes waiver

of the right to dismissal under that section.) Nevertheless, it has been

contended that because Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2) provides that lack of jurisdiction

or failure to allege an offense "shall be noticed by the court at

 any time during the pendency of the proceedings," "it may,

by negative implications be interpreted as foreclosing the other defense

if not raised during the trial itself." 8A J. Moore, _Moore's

Federal  Practice_ Para. 12.03[1] (1982

rev. ed.). "Pendency of the proceedings" has been held to  include

the appellate process. _See United States v. Thomas_, 444

F.2d 919 (D.C. Cir. 1971). Fed. R. Crim. P. 34 tends to support this construction

insofar as it permits a posttrial motion in arrest of judgment only for lack

of jurisdiction over the offense or failure to charge an offense. There is

no reason why other motions should not be waived if not raised at trial. _

Moore's, supra_ at Para. 12.03[1]; _

accord_ C. Wright, _Federal Practice and Procedure_ &sect;193

(1969). _See also United States v. Scott_, 464 F.2d 832

(D.C. Cir. 1972); _United States v. Friedland_, 391 F.2d

378 (2d Cir. 1968), _cert. denied_, 404 U.S. 867 (1969). _

See generally United States ex rel. DiGiangiemo v.  Regan_, 528

F.2d 1262 (2d Cir. 1975). Decisions of the United States  Court of Military

Appeals are generally consistent with this approach. _See United States

v. Troxell_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 6, 30 C.M.R. 6 (1960) (statute of limitations

may be waived); _United States v. Schilling_, 7 U.S.C.M.A.

482, 22 C.M.R. 272 (1957) (former jeopardy may be waived). _Contra

United States v. Johnson_, 2 M.J. 541 (A.C.M.R. 1976). 

 _

1990 Amendment:_ Subsection (e) was amended to  clarify that "requests"

and "objections" include "motions". 

### (f) Reconsideration.

This subsection is new and makes clear that the military judge may

 reconsider rulings except as noted. The amendment of Article 62 (_

see_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209, &sect; 5(c),

97 Stat. 1393 (1983)), which deleted the requirement for reconsideration

when directed by the convening authority' does not preclude this. _

See_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 24 (1983). 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ The amendment to R.C.M. 905(f) clarifies that the

military judge has the authority to take remedial action to correct any errors

that have prejudiced the rights of an accused. _United States v. Griffith

_, 27 M.J. 42, 47 (C.M.A. 1988). Such remedial action may be taken

at a pre-trial session, during trial, or at a post-trial Article 39(a) session.

 _See also United States v. Scaff_, 29 M.J. 60, 65-66 (C.M.A.

 1989). The amendment, consistent with R.C.M. 1102(d), clarifies that post-trial

 reconsideration is permitted until the record of trial is authenticated. 

 The

amendment to the Discussion clarifies that the amendment to subsection (f)

does not change the standard to be used to determine the legal sufficiency

of evidence. R.C.M. 917(d); _see Griffith, supra; see also Scaff,

supra_. 

### (g) Effect of final determinations.

Except as noted below, this subsection is based on paragraph 71

 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on _Ashe v. Swenson_,

397 U.S. 436 (1970); _Oppenheimer v. United States_, 242 U.S.

85 (1916); _United States v. Marks_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 281, 45

C.M.R. 55 (1972); _Restatement of Judgements_, Chapter 3

(1942). _ See also Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen_,

 333 U.S. 591 (1948); _United States v. Moser_, 266 U.S. 236

 (1924); _United States v. Washington_, 7 M.J. 78 (C.M.A.

1979); _United States v. Hart_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 438, 42 C.M.R.

40 (1970); _United States v. Smith_, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 369, 15

C.M.R. 369 (1954). 

 Subsection (g) differs from paragraph 71 _

b_ in two significant respects. First, the term, "res judicata"

is not used in R.C.M. 905(g) because the term is legalistic and potentially

confusing. "Res judicata" generally includes several distinct

but related concepts: merger, bar, direct estoppel, and collateral estoppel. _

Restatement of Judgments_, Chapter 3  Introductory Note at 160 (1942). _

But see_ 1B J. Moore, _Moore's Federal Practice_

Para. 0.441(1) (1980 rev. ed.) which distinguishes collateral estoppel

from res judicata generally. Second, unique aspects of the doctrine of collateral

estoppel are recognized in the "except" clause of the first sentence

in the rule. Earlier Manuals included the concept of collateral estoppel

within the general discussion of res judicata (_see_ paragraph

72 _b_ of MCM (Army), 1949; paragraph 71 _ b_ of

MCM, 1951, paragraph 71 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _

see also United States v. Smith, supra_) without discussing its

distinguishing characteristics. Unlike other forms of res judicata, collateral

estoppel applies to determinations made in actions in which the causes of

action were different. 1B J. Moore, _supra_, Para. 0.441[1].

Because of this, its application is somewhat narrower. Specifically, parties

are not bound by determinations of law when the causes of action in the

two suits arose out of different transactions. _Restatement of Judgments,

supra_, &sect;&sect; 68, 70. _ See also Commissioner v. Sunnen,

supra._ This distinction is now recognized in the rule. 

 The

absence of such a clarifying provision in earlier Manuals apparently caused

the majority, despite its misgivings and over the dissent of Judge Brosman,

to reach the result it did in _United States v. Smith,  supra_.

When paragraph 71 _b_ was rewritten in MCM, 1969 (Rev.), the

 result in _Smith _ was incorporated into that paragraph, but

neither the concerns of the Court of Military Appeals nor the distinguishing

characteristics of collateral estoppel were addressed. _ See Analysis

of Contents of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969, Revised

Edition_, DA Pam 27-2 at 12-5 (July 1970). To the extent

that _Smith_ relied on the Manual, its result is no longer

required. _But see United States V Martin_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 346,

352, 24 C.M.R. 156, 162  (1957) (Quinn, C.J., joined by Ferguson, J. concurring

in the result). 

 The discussion is based on the sources indicated

above. _See also Restatement of Judgments, supra_ &sect; 49; _

United States v. Guzman_, 4 M.J. 115 (C.M.A. 1977). As to the effect

of pretrial determinations by a convening authority, _see_ Analysis,

R.C.M. 306(a). 

### (h) Written motions.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 47. 

### (i) Service.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 49(a) and (b), insofar

 as those provisions apply to motions. 

### (j) Application to convening authority.

This subsection is taken from paragraph 66 _b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) although certain exceptions provided elsewhere in these

rules (_e.g._, R.C.M. 906(b)(1)) have been established for

the first time. It is consistent with the judicial functions of the convening

authority under Article 64. It also provides a forum for resolution of disputes

before referral and in the absence of the military judge after referral.

It has no counterpart in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 

 Fed.

R. Crim. P. 12(g) and (h) are not included. Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(g) is covered

at R.C.M. 803 and 808. The matters in Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(h) would fall under

the procedures in R.C.M. 304 and 305. 

### (k) Production of statements on motion to suppress.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(i). 

## Rule 906. Motions for appropriate relief

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of paragraph 69 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The phrase concerning deprivation of rights

is new; it applies to such pretrial matters as defects in the pretrial advice

and the legality of pretrial confinement. Paragraph 69 _ a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) provided only for the accused to make motions for appropriate

relief. This rule is not so restricted because the prosecution may also

request appropriate relief. _See e.g., United States v. Nivens_,

21 U.S.C.M.A. 420, 45 C.M.R. 194 (1972). This change is not intended to

modify or restrict the power of the convening authority or other officials

 to direct that action be taken notwithstanding the fact that such action

might also be sought by the trial counsel by motion for appropriate relief

before the military judge. Specific modifications of the powers of such

officials are noted expressly in the rules or analysis. 

### (b) Grounds for appropriate relief.

This subsection has the same general purpose as paragraph 69 of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It identifies most of the grounds for motions for appropriate

relief commonly raised in courts-martial, and provides certain rules for

litigating and deciding such motions where these rules are not provided elsewhere

in the Manual. Specific sources for the rules and discussion are described

below.

 _2015 Amendment_: R.C.M. 906(b)(8) was revised to implement Articles 6b(a)(2)(E) and 6b(a)(4)(A), UCMJ, as created by Section 1701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013.

 Subsection (1) and the accompanying discussion are based

on Article 40 and paragraphs 58 _b_ and _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The rule provides that only a military judge may grant

a continuance. Paragraph 58 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which

provided for "postponement" has been deleted. Reposing power

to postpone proceedings in the convening authority is inconsistent with the

authority of the military judge to schedule proceedings and control the docket. _

See generally United States v. Wolzok_, 1 M.J. 125 (C.M.A. 1975).

To the extent that paragraph 58 _a_ extended to the military

judge the power to direct postponement, it was duplicative of the power to

grant a continuance and unnecessary.

 Subsection (2) is based on paragraph 48 _b_(4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Redding_, 11 M.J. 100 (C.M.A. 1981).

 Subsection (3) is based on paragraph 69 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

United States v. Johnson_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 710, 31 C.M.R. 296 (1962).

 Subsection

(5) and its discussion are based on paragraph 28 _b_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Collins_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 167,

36 C.M.R. 323 (1966); _United States v. Means_, 12 U.S.C.M.A.

C.M.R. 722 (A.B.R. 1963). _See also_ paragraphs 158 and 200 _

 a_(8) of MCM, 1969 (Rev). _But see United States v. Davis

_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 207, 36 C.M.R. 363 (1966) (thefts occurring at

different places and times over four-month period were separate).

 Subsection

(6) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f). Although not expressly provided for

in the previous Manual, bills of particulars have been recognized in military

practice. _See United States v. Alef_, 3 M.J. 414 (C.M.A.

1977); _United States v. Paulk_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 456, 32 C.M.R.

20 A.F.L. Rev. 22 (1978); Dunn, _Military Pleadings_, 17 A.F.L.

 Rev. 17 (Fall, 1975). The discussion is based on _United States V.

Mannino_, 480 F. Supp. 1182, 1185 (S.D. N.Y. 1979); _United

States v. Deaton_, 448 F. Supp. 532 (N.D. Ohio 1978); _see

bill, _see United States v.  Diecidue_, 603 F.2d 535, 563

(5th Cir. 1979); _United States v. Murray_, 527 F.2d 401,

411 (5th Cir. 1976); _United States v. Mannino, supra; United States

v. Hubbard_, 474 F. Supp. 64, 80-81 (D. D.C. 1979).

 Subsection

(7) is based on paragraphs 75 _e_ and 115 _a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(4); _

United States v. Killebrew_, 9 M.J. 154 (C.M.A. 1980); _

United States v. Chuculate_, 5 M.J. 143 (C.M.A. 1978). 

 Subsection

(8) is new to the Manual although not to military  practice. _See

_ Analysis, R.C.M. 305(j). 

 Subsection (9) is based on

paragraph 69 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 to the extent that the latter applies to severance of codefendants. Note

 that the Government may also accomplish a severance by proper withdrawal

of charges against one or more codefendants and rereferrals of these charges

to another court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 604. The discussion

is based on paragraph 69 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(10) is new. It roughly parallels Fed. R. Crim. P. 14, but is much narrower

because of the general policy in the military favoring trial of all known

charges at a single court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 601(e) and

discussion; _United States v. Keith_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 442, 4

 C.M.R. 34 (1952). Motions to sever charges have, in effect, existed through

the policy in paragraph 26c of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), against joining minor and

major offenses. _See, e.g., United States v. Grant_, 26 C.M.R.

692 (A.B.R. 1958). Although that provision has been eliminated, severance

of offenses may still be appropriate in unusual cases. _See generally

United States v. Gettz_, 49 C.M.R. 79 (N.C.M.R. 1974). 

 Subsection

(11) is based generally on paragraph 69 _ e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

and on Fed. R. Crim. P. 21. _See United States v. Nivens, supra; United

States v. Gravitt_, 5 U.S.C.M.A. 249, 17 C.M.R. 249 (1954). The

constitutional requirement that the trial of a crime occur in the district

in which the crime was committed (U.S. Const. Art. II, sec. 2, cl. 3; amend

VI) does not apply in the military. _Chenoweth v. VanArsdall_,

22 U.S.C.M.A. 183, 46 C.M.R. 183 (1973). Therefore Fed. R. Crim. P. 21(b)

 is inapplicable. In recognition of this, and of the fact that the convening

 authority has an interest, both financial and operational, in fixing the

place of the trial, the rule allows the situs of the trial to be set and

changed for the convenience of the Government, subject to judicial protection

of the accused's rights as they may be affected by that situs.

_See United States v. Nivens, supra._

 Subsection (12) is based on paragraph 76 _a_(5) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

_See also_ Analysis, R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B) and Analysis, R.C.M. 1003(c)(1)(C).

 _2015 Amendment_. This rule and related discussion is the focal point for addressing unreasonable multiplication of charges. If a practitioner seeks to raise a claim for multiplicity, that concept is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B) and related discussion. This rule has been amended because CAAF has recognized that practitioners and the courts have routinely confused the concepts of multiplicity and unreasonable multiplication of charges. _See, e.g., United States v. Campbell_, 71 M.J. 19, 23 (C.A.A.F. 2012) ("the terms multiplicity, multiplicity for sentencing, and unreasonable multiplication of charges in military practice are sometimes used interchangeably as well as with uncertain definition"); _United States v. Baker_, 14 M.J. 361, 372 (C.M.A. 1983) (Cook, J. dissenting) ("[t]hat multiplicity for sentencing is a mess in the military justice system is a proposition with which I believe few people familiar with our system would take issue").

 Multiplicity and unreasonable multiplication of charges are two distinct concepts. Unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence is a limitation on the prosecution's discretion to charge separate offenses.  Unreasonable multiplication of charges does not have a foundation in the Constitution but is instead based on the concept of reasonableness and is a prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. In contrast, multiplicity is based on the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and prevents an accused from being twice punished for one offense if it is contrary to the intent of Congress. A charge may be found not to be multiplicious but at the same time it may be dismissed because of unreasonable multiplication. _See United States v. Quiroz_, 55 M.J. 334, 337-38 (C.A.A.F. 2001).

 Use of the term "multiplicity (or multiplicious) for sentencing" is inappropriate. If a charge is multiplicious, meaning that it violates the Constitutional prohibition against Double Jeopardy, it necessarily results in dismissal of the multiplied offenses, therefore obviating any issue on sentencing with respect to that charge. _Campbell_, 71 M.J. at 23. A charge should not be found multiplicious for sentencing but not for findings. Thus, the more appropriate term for the military judge's discretionary review of the charges at sentencing is "unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence."  _Id._ at 24. The rule was changed to remove "multiplicity for sentencing" from the Manual, eliminating confusion and misuse.

 Subparagraphs (i) and (ii) were added to the rule to clarify the distinction between unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and to sentence. Although these concepts have existed for years (_see_ Michael J. Breslin & LeEllen Coacher, _Multiplicity and Unreasonable Multiplication of Charges: A Guide to the Perplexed_, 45 A.F.L. Rev. 99 (1998) for a history of the terms), they were not defined in previous editions of the Manual. The definitions were adopted from _Quiroz, Campbell_, and recommendations from Christopher S. Morgan, _Multiplicity: Reconciling the Manual for Courts-Martial_, 63 A.F.L. Rev. 23 (2009). It is possible that two offenses are not unreasonably multiplied for findings but are so for sentencing; these additions explain how this can be so. _See, e.g., Campbell_, 71 M.J. at 25 (military judge did not abuse his discretion by finding that there was not an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings but that there was an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence).

 The discussion sections were added to address concerns that CAAF voiced in dicta in Campbell. In previous editions of the Manual, military judges often used the discussion section in R.C.M. 1003(c)(1) to determine when relief was warranted for unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence.  The Campbell court stated in a footnote: "It is our view that after Quiroz, the language in the Discussion to R.C.M. 1003(c)(1)(C) regarding 'a single impulse or intent,' is dated and too restrictive. The better approach is to allow the military judge, in his or her discretion, to merge the offense for sentencing purposes by considering the Quiroz factors and any other relevant factor . . . ." _Campbell_, 71 M.J. at 24 n.9.  The Discussion was changed to address the Quiroz factors and remove any reference to the "single impulse or intent" test, as suggested by CAAF. The committee also decided to move the Discussion section from R.C.M. 1003(b)(8)(C) to this rule because R.C.M. 1003 deals exclusively with sentencing and a motion for appropriate relief due to unreasonable multiplication of charges can be raised as an issue for findings or for sentence under this Rule. Therefore, it is more appropriate to address the issue here.

 For more information on multiplicity and how it relates to unreasonable multiplication of charges, see Michael J. Breslin & LeEllen Coacher, _Multiplicity and Unreasonable Multiplication of Charges: A Guide to the Perplexed_, 45 A.F.L. Rev. 99 (1998); Christopher S. Morgan, _Multiplicity: Reconciling the Manual for Courts-Martial_, 63 A.F.L. Rev. 23 (2009); Gary E. Felicetti, _Surviving the Multiplicty/LIO Family Vortex_, Army Law.R, Feb. 2011, at 46.

 The language in the discussion section of the 2012 edition of the Manual referring to the _Campbell_ decision was removed because it is no longer necessary, as the rules themselves have been edited to remove any reference to "multiplicious for sentencing" and additional discussion sections were added to eliminate any confusion with the terms.

 Subsection (13) is new to the Manual, although motions _in limine_ have

been recognized previously. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 104(c);

_United States v. Cofield_, 11 M.J. 422 (C.M.A. 1981); Siano,

_Motions in Limine_, The Army Lawyer, 17 (Jan. 1976). 

 

_1994 Amendment._ The Discussion to subparagraph (13) was amended

to reflect the holding in _United States v. Sutton_, 31 M.J.

11 (C.M.A. 1990). The Court of Military Appeals in _Sutton _ held

that its decision in_United States v. Cofield_, 11 M.J. 422

(C.M.A. 1981), should not be relied upon to determine reviewability of preliminary

rulings in courts-martial. Instead, reviewability of preliminary rulings

will be controlled by_Luce v. United States_, 469 U.S. 38

(1984). 

 Subsection (14) is based on paragraph 69 _f_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 706, R.C.M. 909,

and Analysis, R.C.M. 916(k).

## Rule 907. Motions to dismiss

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 68 and 214 of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

 Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a) is inapposite because the trial

counsel may not independently request dismissal of charges, and unnecessary

because the convening authority already has authority to withdraw and to

dismiss charges. _See_ R.C.M. 306(c)(1); 401(c)(1); 604. The

matters contained in Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(b) are addressed by R.C.M. 707

and 907(b)(2)(A). 

### (b) Grounds for dismissal.

This subsection lists common grounds for motions to dismiss. It

is not intended to be exclusive. It is divided into three subsections. These

correspond to nonwaivable (subsection (1)) and waivable (subsection (2)

and (3)) motions to dismiss (_see_ R.C.M. 905(e) and analysis),

and to circumstances which require dismissal (subsections (1) and (2)) and

those in which dismissal is only permissible (subsection (3).

 Subsection (1) is based on paragraph 68 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2) and 34.

 Subsection (2)(A) is based on paragraph 68 _i_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3162(a)(2). The rules for speedy

trial are covered in R.C.M. 707.

 _2005 Amendment_:  The discussion was based upon the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-136, &sect; 551, 117 Stat. 1481 (2003).  The amendment to Art. 43, UCMJ creates a statute of limitations period that extends until a child-victim attains the age of 25 years for certain specified UCMJ and federal offenses committed on or after 24 November 1998.  Due to Ex Post Facto considerations, allowance is required for those child abuse cases in which the five-year statute of limitations was expired at the time the amendment to Article 43, UCMJ, became effective.  _See generally Stogner v. California_, 539 U.S. 607, 609 (2003).  All child abuse offenses committed prior to that date would be subject to the previous five-year statute of limitations that would expire on the day prior to the effective date of the amendment - November 24, 2003.  The referenced case permits unexpired periods to be extended by the new statute, but does not allow the statute to renew an expired period.

 _2007 Amendment_:  The discussion was changed based upon the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-163, &sect; 553, 119 Stat. 3136 (2006).  The amendment to Art. 43, UCMJ creates a statute of limitations period that extends through the life of a child-victim or for 5 years, whichever is longer, for certain specified UCMJ and federal offenses.  At least one court has ruled that the new statute of limitations applied retrospectively to all offenses for which the original statute had not expired on the date when the extensions were enacted.  _See United States v. Ratliff_, 65 M.J. 806 (N.M.C.C.A. 2007), _stay granted United States v. Ratliff_, 2007 CAAF LEXIS 1598 (C.A.A.F., Dec. 3, 2007).

 Subsection (2)(B) is based on the first two paragraphs in paragraph 68 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Troxell_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 6, 30 C.M.R.

 6 (1960); _United States v. Rodgers_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 226, 24

 C.M.R. 36 (1957). The discussion is based on paragraphs 68 _c_

and 215 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States

 v. Arbic_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 292, 36 C.M.R. 448 (1966); _United

States v. Spain_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 410, 27 C.M.R. 484 (1959); _

United States v. Reeves_, 49 C.M.R. 841 (A.C.M.R. 1975). 

 _

1987 Amendment:_ The discussion under subsection (b)(2)(B) was revised

to reflect several amendments to Article 43, UCMJ, contained in the "Military

 Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII, &sect; 805, National

Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-661,

 100 Stat. 3905, (1986). These amendments were derived, in part, from Chapter

 213 of Title 18, United States Code. 

 _1990 Amendment:

_ The fourth paragraph of the discussion under subsection (b)(2)(B)

was amended to reflect the holding in _United States v. Tunnell_,

 23 M.J. 110 (C.M.A. 1986). 

 Subsection (2)(C) is based on paragraph

215 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and Article 44. _See also

_ paragraph 56 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Concerning the applicability

to courts-martial of the double jeopardy clause (U.S. Const. Amend. V), _

see Wade v. Hunter_, 336 U.S. 684 (1949); _United States

v. Richardson_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 54, 44 C.M.R. 108  (1971). _

See also United States v. Francis_, 15 M.J. 424 (C.M.A. 1983). 

 Subsection

(2)(C)(i) is based on Article 44(c). The applicability of _Crist

v. Bretz_, 437 U.S. 28 (1978) was considered. _Crist_ held

that, in jury cases, jeopardy attaches when the jury is empanelled and sworn.

For reasons stated below, the Working Group concluded that the beginning

of the presentation of evidence on the merits, which is the constitutional

standard for nonjury trial (_Crist v. Bretz, supra_ at 37

n. 15; _Serfass v. United States_, 420 U.S. 377 (1975)) and

is prescribed by Article 44(c), is the proper cutoff point. 

 There

is no jury in courts-martial. _O'Callahan v. Parker_, 395

U.S. 258 (1969); _Ex parte Quirin_, 317 U.S. 1 (1942); _

United States v. Crawford_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 31, 35 C.M.R. 3, (1964). _

See also United States v. McCarthy_, 2 M.J. 26, 29 n.3 (C.M.A. 1976).

Members are an essential jurisdictional element of a court-martial. _

United States v. Ryan_, 5 M.J. 97 (C.M.A. 1978). Historically the

members, as an entity, served as jury _ and_ judge, or, in

other words, as the "court." W. Winthrop, _Military Law

and Precedents_ 54-55, 173 (2d. ed., 1920 reprint). Assembling

the court-martial has not been the last step before trial on the merits. _

See_ paragraph 61 _j_ and appendix 8 _b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.); paragraph 61 _h_ and _i_ and

appendix 8 _a_ of MCM, 1951; paragraph 61 of MCM, 1949 (Army);

paragraph 61 of MCM, 1928; W. Winthrop,_supra_ at 205-80.

Congress clearly contemplated that the members may be sworn at an early

point in the proceedings. _See_ Article 42(a); H. Rep. No.

491, 81st Cong. 1st Sess. 22 (1949). 

 The role of members has

become somewhat more analogous to that of a jury. _See, e.g._,

 Article 39(a). Nevertheless, significant differences remain. When they are

 present, the members with the military judge constitute the court-martial

and participate in the exercise of contempt power. Article 48. _

See_ R.C.M. 809 and analysis. Moreover members may sit as a special

court-martial without a military judge, in which case they exercise all

judicial functions. Articles 19; 26; 40; 41; 51; 52. 

 The holding

in _Crist_ would have adverse practical effect if applied

in the military. In addition to being unworkable in special court-martial

without a military judge, it would negate the utility of Article 29, which

provides that the assembly of the court-martial does not wholly preclude

later substitution of members. This provision recognizes that military exigencies

or other unusual circumstances may cause a member to be unavailable at any

stage in the court-martial. It also recognizes that the special need of the

military to dispose of offenses swiftly, without necessary diversion of personnel

and other resources, may justify continuing the trial with substituted members,

rather that requiring a mistrial. This provision is squarely at odds with

civilian practice with respect to juries and, therefore, with the rationale

in _ Crist_. 

 Subsection (2)(C)(ii) is based on

paragraph 56 of MCM, 1969 (Rev). _See also Wade v. Hunter, supra;

 United States v. Perez_, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579 (1824). "Manifest

necessity" is the traditional justification for a mistrial. _

Id. See United States v. Richardson, supra. Cf._ Article 44(c),

which does not prohibit retrial of a proceeding terminated on motion of the

accused. _See also_ Analysis, R.C.M. 915. 

 Subsection

(2)(C)(ii) is taken from Article 44(b). _See United States v. Richardson,

supra. See also_ Article 63. _But see_ R.C.M. 810(d). 

 Subsection(2)(C)(iv)

is new. It is axiomatic that jeopardy does not attach in a proceeding which

lacks jurisdiction. _Ball v. United States_, 163 U.S. 662

(1973). Therefore, if proceedings are terminated before findings because

the court-martial lacks jurisdiction, retrial is not barred if the jurisdictional

defect is corrected. For example, if during the course of trial it is discovered

that the charges were not referred to the court-martial by a person empowered

to do so, those proceedings would be terminated. This would not bar later

referral of those charges by a proper official to a court-martial. _

Cf. Lee v. United States_, 432 U.S. 23 (1977); _Illinois v.

Somerville_, 410 U.S. 458 (1973). _See also United States

v. Newcomb_, 5 M.J. 4 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Hardy

_, 4 M.J. 20 (C.M.A. 1977) authorizing re-referral of charges where

earlier proceedings lacked jurisdiction because of defects in referral and

composition. Res judicata would bar retrial by a court-martial for a jurisdictional

defect which is not "correctable." _See, e.g._,

R.C.M. 202 and 203. _See also_ R.C.M. 905(g). 

 By

its terms, the rule permits a retrial of a person acquitted by a court-martial

which lacks jurisdiction. The Court of Military Appeals decision in _

United States v. Culver_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 141, 46 C.M.R. 141 (1973)

does not preclude this, although that decision raises questions concerning

this result. There was no majority opinion in _Culver_. Judge

Quinn held that the defect (absence of a written judge alone request) was

not jurisdictional. In the alternative, Judge Quinn construed paragraph 81 _

d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and the automatic review structure in courts-martial

as precluding retrial on an offense of which the accused had been acquitted.

(Note that R.C.M. 810(d), using slightly different language, continues the

same policy of limiting the maximum sentence for offenses tried at an "other

 trial" to that adjudged at the earlier defective trial.) Judge Duncan,

concurring in the result in _ Culver_, found that although

the original trial was jurisdictionally defective, the defect was not so

fundamental as to render the proceedings void. In Judge Duncan's view, the

original court-martial had jurisdiction when it began, but "lost"

it when the request for military judge alone was not reduced to writing.

Therefore, the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment and Article

44 barred the second trial for an offense of which the accused had been acquitted

at the first. Chief Judge Darden dissented. He held that because the earlier

court-martial lacked jurisdiction, the proceedings were void and did not

bar the second trial. Thus in _Culver_, two judges divided

over whether the double jeopardy clause bars a second trial for an offense

of which the accused was acquitted at a court-martial which lacked jurisdiction

because of improper composition. The third judge held retrial was barred

on non constitutional grounds. 

 Subsection (2)(D) is based on paragraph

68 _e f, g_ , and _h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

As to subsection (iv) _see United States v. Williams_.  10

U.S.C.M.A. 615, 28 C.M.R. 181 (1959). 

 Subsection (3) sets out

grounds which, unlike those in subsection (1) and (2), do not _require

_ dismissal when they exist. The military judge has discretion whether

to dismiss or to apply another remedy (such as a continuance in the case

of subsection (3)(A), or sentencing instructions in the case of subsection

(3)(B)). _But see United States v. Sturdivant_, 13 M.J. 323

(C.M.A. 1982). _See also United States v. Baker_, 14 M.J.

 361 (C.M.A. 1983). 

 Subsection (3)(A) and the discussion are based

on paragraph 69 _b_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(3)(B) is based on paragraph 26 _b_, 74 _b_(4),

and 76 _a_(5) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v.

 Gibson_, 11 M.J. 435 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Stegall

_, 6 M.J. 176 (C.M.A. 1979); _ United States v. Williams_,

18 U.S.C.M.A. 78, 39 C.M.R. 78 (1968).

 _2015 Amendment._ This rule and related discussion is the focal point for addressing claims of multiplicity. If a practitioner seeks to raise a claim for unreasonable multiplication of charges, that concept is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12) and related discussion. The heading of this rule was added to signify that this rule deals exclusively with multiplicity, and not unreasonable multiplication of charges.  The discussion section of this rule was amended because the committee believed that a more thorough definition of multiplicity was appropriate in light of CAAF's suggestion in _United States v. Campbell_, 71 M.J. 19, 23 (C.A.A.F. 2012), that the concepts of multiplicity and unreasonable multiplication of charges are often confounded.

 The discussion of multiplicity is derived from the Supreme Court's holding in _Blockburger v. United States_, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), and CMA's holding in _United States v. Teters_, 37 M.J. 370 (C.M.A. 1993). The Court in _Blockburger_ wrote: "[W]here the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not." _Blockburger_, 284 U.S. at 304. Military courts departed from the _Blockburger_ analysis; however, the CMA's decision in _Teters_ clearly re-aligned the military courts with the federal courts, and multiplicity is now determined in the military courts by the _Blockburger/Teters_ analysis outlined in the discussion section. Any reference to the "single impulse" or "fairly embraced" tests is outdated and should be avoided.

 Two offenses that arise from the same transaction may not be multiplicious, even if each does not require proof of an element not required to prove the other, if the intent of Congress was that an accused could be convicted of and punished for both offenses arising out of the same act. The _Blockburger/Teters_ analysis applies only when Congress did not intend  that the offenses be treated as separate. If Congress intended to subject an accused to multiple punishments for the same transaction, and that intent is clear, the _Blockburger/Teters_ elements comparison is unnecessary. _See, e.g., Missouri v. Hunter_, 459 U.S. 359, 368-69 (1983) ("[S]imply because two criminal statutes may be construed to proscribe the same conduct under the Blockburger test does not mean that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the imposition, in a single trial, of cumulative punishments pursuant to those statutes. . . . Where . . . a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe the 'same' conduct under _Blockburger_, a court's task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.").

 The language in the discussion section of the 2012 edition of the Manual referring to the _Campbell_ decision was removed because it is no longer necessary, as the Rules themselves have been edited to remove any reference to "multiplicious for sentencing" and additional discussion sections were added to eliminate any confusion with the terms.

## Rule 908. Appeal by the United States

 _Introduction._ This rule is based on Article

 62, as amended, Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-209,

&sect; 5(c)(1), 97 Stat 1393 (1983). _See also_ S.

Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st. Sess. 23 (1983); 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3731.

Article 62 now provides the Government with a means to seek review of certain

rulings or orders of the military judge. The need for such procedure has

been recognized previously. _See United States v. Rowel_,

1 M.J. 289, 291 (C.M.A. 1976) (Fletcher, C.J., concurring). _See

also Dettinger v. United States_, 7 M.J. 216 (C.M.A. 1978). It is

not expected that every ruling or order which might be appealed by the Government

will be appealed. Frequent appeals by the Government would disrupt trial

dockets and could interfere with military operations and other activities,

and would impose a heavy burden on appellate courts and counsel. Therefore

this rule includes procedures to ensure that the Government's right to appeal

 is exercised carefully. _See_ S. Rep. No. 53 _ supra

_ at 23. 

### (a) In general.

This subsection repeats the first sentence of Article 62(a). 

 _

1998 Amendment_: The change to R.C.M. 908(a) resulted from the amendment

to Article 62, UCMJ, in section 1141, National Defense Authorization Act

for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 466-67

(1996). It permits interlocutory appeal of rulings disclosing classified

information. 

### (b) Procedure.

Subsection (1) provides the trial counsel with a mechanism to ensure

 that further proceedings do not make an issue moot before the Government

can file notice of appeal. 

 The first sentence in subsection (2)

is based on the second sentence of Article 62(a). The second sentence in

subsection(2) authorizes an initial measure to ensure that a decision to

file notice of appeal is carefully considered. The Secretary concerned may

require trial counsel to secure authorization from another person, such

as the convening authority, the convening authority's designee, or the staff

judge advocate. Because the decision whether to file the notice must be

made within 72 hours, it probably will not be practicable in many cases

to secure authorization from a more distant authority (_see_

subsection (b)(5) and Analysis, below), but nothing in this subsection prohibits

requiring this authorization to be secured from, for example, the chief of

appellate Government counsel or a similar official in the office of the

Judge Advocate General. Note that the Secretary concerned is not required

to require authorization by anyone before notice of appeal is filed. The

 provision is intended solely for the benefit of the Government, to avoid

disrupting trial dockets and the consequences this has on command activities,

 and to prevent overburdening appellate courts and counsel. The accused has

no right to have the Government forego an appeal which it might take. _

But see_ R.C.M. 707(c)(1)(D). The authorization may be oral and no

 reason need be given. 

 Subsection (3) is based on the second and

third sentences of Article 62(a). The second sentence is added to permit

decisions by defense counsel and the military judge on how to proceed as

to any unaffected charges and specifications under subsection (4).

 Subsection

(4) is necessary because, unlike in Federal civilian trials (_see

Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a)), unrelated offenses_ may be and often are

tried together in courts-martial. Consequently, a ruling or order which is

appealable by the Government may affect only some charges and specifications.

As to those offenses, the pendency of an appeal under this rule necessarily

halts further proceedings. It does not necessarily have the same effect on

other charges and specifications unaffected by the appeal. Subsection (4)

provides several alternatives to halting the court-martial entirely, even

as to charges and specifications unaffected by the appeal. Subsection (4)(A)

permits motions to be litigated as to unaffected charges and specifications,

regardless of the stage of the proceedings. Subsection (4)(B) permits unaffected

charges and specifications to be served, but only before trial on the merits

has begun, that is, before jeopardy has attached. _See_ R.C.M.

907(b)(2)(C) and Analysis. Once jeopardy has attached, the accused is entitled

to have all the charges and specification resolved by the same court-martial. _

Cf. Crist v. Bretz_, 437 U.S. 28 (1978). It is expected that in

most cases, rulings or orders subject to appeal by the Government will be

made before trial on the merits has begun. _See_ R.C.M. 905(b)

 and (e); Mil. R. Evid. 304(d), 311(d), and 321(c). Subsection (4)(C) provides

a mechanism to alleviate the adverse effect an appeal by the Government may

have on unaffected charges and specifications. Thus witnesses who are present

but whom it may be difficult and expensive to recall at a later time may,

at the request of the proponent party and in the discretion of the military

judge, be called to testify during the pendency of any appeal. Such witnesses

may be called out of order. _See also_ R.C.M. 801(a); 914;

 Mil. R. Evid. 611. Note, however, that a party cannot be compelled to call

such witnesses or present evidence until the appeal is resolved. This is

because a party's tactics may be affected by the resolution of the appeal.

Note also that if similar problems arise as to witnesses whose testimony

 relates to an affected specification, a deposition could be taken, but it

 could not be used at any later proceedings unless the witness was unavailable

or the parties did not object. 

 Subsection (5) ensures that a record

will be prepared promptly. Because the appeal ordinarily will involve only

specific issues, the record need be complete only as to relevant matters.

Defense counsel will ordinarily have the opportunity to object to any omissions. _

 See_ R.C.M. 1103(i)(1)(B). Furthermore, the military judge and

the Court of Criminal Appeals may direct preparation of additional portions

 of the record. 

 Subsection (6) provides for the matter to be forwarded

promptly. No specific time limit is established, but ordinarily the matters

specified should be forwarded within one working day. Note that the record

need not be forwarded at this point as that might delay disposition. If the

record is not ready, a summary may be forwarded for preliminary consideration

before completion of the record. An appropriate authority will then decide

 whether to file the appeal, in accordance with procedures established by

the Judge Advocate General. _See_ S.Rep. No. 53, _

supra_ at 23. This is an administrative determination; a decision

not to file the appeal has no effect as precedent. Again, no specific time

limit is set for this decision, but it should be made promptly under the

circumstances. 

 Subsection (7) is based on Article 62(b). 

 Subsection

(8) ensures that trial participants are notified in the event no appeal is

filed. 

 _1991 Amendment:_ Subsection (4) was amended

to state explicitly that, upon timely notice of appeal, the legal effect

of an appealable ruling or order is stayed pending appellate resolution.

Although most military practitioners understood this necessary effect of

an appeal under the rule, some civilian practitioners were confused by the

absence of an explicit statement in the rule. 

 New subsection

(9) is based on 18 U.S.C. &sect;  3143(c) governing the release of

an accused pending appeal by the United States of an order of dismissal of

an indictment or information, or an order suppressing evidence. Since appeals

by the United States under Article 62, U.C.M.J., contemplate a situation

 in which the accused has not been convicted, a commander's decision whether

to subject the individual to continued confinement after an appeal has been

taken should be based on the same considerations which would authorize the

imposition of pretrial confinement. 

### (c) Appellate proceedings.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 70(b) and (c). 

 Subsection

(2) is based on Article 62(b). 

 Subsection (3) is based on Article

67(b) and (h) and on 28 U.S.C. &sect;  1259. Note that if the decision

of the Court of Criminal Appeals permits it (i.e., is favorable to the Government)

the court-martial may proceed as to the affected charges and specifications

notwithstanding the possibility or pendency of review by the Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces or the Supreme Court. Those courts could stay the proceedings.

The penultimate sentence is similar in purpose to Article 66(e) and 67(f).

### (d) Military judge.

This subsection is necessary because Article 62 authorizes appeals

by the Government only when a military judge is detailed. 

 _

1998 Amendment:_ The change to R.C.M. 908(a) resulted from the amendment

to Article 62, UCMJ, in section 1141, National Defense Authorization Act

for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 466-67 (1996).

 It permits interlocutory appeal of rulings disclosing classified information.

## Rule 909. Capacity of the accused to stand trial by court-martial

 This rule is based on paragraphs 120 _a_ and

 _d_, and 122 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It has been reorganized

and minor changes were made in some language in order to conform to the format

and style of the Rules for Courts-Martial. The procedures for examining the

mental capacity of the accused are covered in R.C.M. 706. Matters referring

solely to the accused's sanity at the time of the offense are treated at

R.C.M. 916(k). The rule is generally consistent with 18 U.S.C. &sect; 4244.

The standard of proof has been changed from beyond reasonable doubt to a

preponderance of the evidence. This is consistent with the holdings of those

federal courts which have addressed the issue. _United States v. Gilio

_ , 538 F.2d 972 (3d. Cir. 1976), _cert. denied_,

429 U.S. 1038 (1977); _United States v. Makris_, 535 F.2d

899 (5th Cir. 1976), _cert. denied_, 430 U.S. 954 (1977). 

 _

February 1986 Amendment:_ Following passage of the Insanity Defense

Reform Act, ch. IV, Pub.L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2058 (1984), the rule

was changed pursuant to Article 36, to conform to 18 U.S.C. &sect; 4241(d). 

 _

1998 Amendment:_ The rule was changed to provide for the hospitalization

of an incompetent accused after the enactment of Article 76b, UCMJ, in section

1133 of the Nation Defense Authorization act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub.

L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 464-66 (1996). 

## Rule 910. Pleas

 _Introduction._ This rule is based generally

on Article 45; paragraph 70 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); and on Fed. R. Crim. P.

11. _See also_ H.Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 23-24

(1949); S.Rep. No. 486, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 20-21 (1949). The format

 generally follows that of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11. 

### (a) In general.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 45 and paragraph 70 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The first sentence parallels the first sentence

in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(1), except that no provision is made for pleas

of nolo contendere. Such a plea is unnecessary in courts-martial. _

 Hearings on H. R. 4080 Before A Subcomm, of the Comm. on Armed Services

of the House of Representatives_. 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 1054 (1949). _

See_ 8A.J. Moore, _Moore's Federal Practice_ Para. 11.07(1)

(1980 rev. ed)  concerning the purpose of nolo pleas in civilian practice,

and a discussion of the controversy about them. Furthermore, the practice

connected with nolo pleas (_see_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(f) which

does not require that a factual basis be established in order to accept a

plea of nolo contendere; _see also Moore's supra_ at Para. 11.07(1)

is inconsistent with Article 45. The second sentence on Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a) is covered under subsection (b) of this rule insofar as it pertains

 to military practice. 

 _1993 Amendment:_ The amendment

to R.C.M. 910(a)(1) removed the necessity of pleading guilty to a lesser

included offense by exceptions and substitutions. This parallels the amendment

to R.C.M. 918(a)(1), allowing a finding of guilty to a named lesser included

offense without mandating the use of exceptions and substitutions, made

to correspond more closely to verdict practice in federal district courts. _

See_ Analysis comments for R.C.M. 918(a)(1). 

 Subsection

(2) is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2). Conditional guilty pleas can conserve

judicial and governmental resources by dispensing with a full trial when

the only real issue is determined in a pretrial motion. As in the federal

courts, the absence of clear authority in courts-martial for such a procedure

has resulted in some uncertainty as to whether an accused could preserve

some issues for appellate review despite a plea of guilty. _See e.g.,

 United States v. Schaffer_, 12 M.J. 425 (C.M.A. 1982); _

United States v. Mallett_, 14 M.J. 631 (A.C.M.R. 1982). Now such

issues may be preserved, but only in accordance with this subsection. _

See_ also subsection (j) of this rule. 

 There is no right

to enter a conditional guilty plea. The military judge and the Government

each have complete discretion whether to permit or consent to a conditional

guilty plea. Because the purpose of a conditional guilty plea is to conserve

judicial and government resources, this discretion is not subject to challenge

by the accused. The rationale for this discretion is further explained in

Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 advisory committee note:

    The requirement of approval by the court is most appropriate, as it ensures,

for example, that the defendant is not allowed to take an appeal on the matter

which can only be fully developed by proceeding to trial (citation omitted).

As for consent by the government, it will ensure that conditional pleas

will be allowed only when the decision of the court of appeals will dispose

of the case either by allowing the pleas to stand or by such action as compelling

dismissal of the indictment or suppressing essential evidence. Absent such

circumstances, the conditional plea might only serve to postpone the trial

and require the government to try the case after substantial delay, during

which time witnesses may be lost, memories dimmed, and the offense grown

so stale as to lose jury appeal. The government is in a unique position to

determine whether the matter at issue would be case-dispositive, and, as

a party to the litigation, should have an absolute right to refuse to consent

to potentially prejudicial delay.

 The last sentence of subsection (a)(2) has been added to the language of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).

 This permits the Secretary concerned to require that consent of the Government

 be obtained at higher echelons or at a centralized point. The consequences

of overuse of conditional guilty pleas will be visited upon appellate courts

and activities and the consequences of inappropriate use of them will typically

fall on a command or installation different from the one where the original

court-martial sat. Thus, it may be deemed appropriate to establish procedures

to guard against such problems. 

### (b) Refusal to plead, irregular plea.

The subsection is based on Article 45(a) and paragraph 70 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It parallels the second sentence of Fed.

R. Crim. P. 11(a), but is broadened to conform to Article 45(a). The portion

 of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a) concerning corporate defendants does not apply

in courts-martial. The discussion is based on the last sentence of the first

paragraph of paragraph 70 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (c) Advice of accused.

This subsection is taken from Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c) and is consistent

with paragraph 70 _b_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See

also_ H.R. Rep. No. 491, _ supra_ at 23-24; S.Rep.

No. 486, _supra_ at 20-21; _Boykin v. Alabama

_, 395 U.S. 238 (1969); _McCarthy v. United States_,

394 U.S. 459 (1969); _United States v. Care_, 18 U.S.C.M.A.

535, 40 C.M.R. 247 (1969). 

 As to subsection (1), the requirement

that the accused understand the elements of the offense is of constitutional

dimensions. _Henderson v. Morgan_, 426 U.S. 637 (1976); _

see also United States v. Care, supra_. The elements need not be

listed as such, seriatim, if it clearly appears that the accused was apprised

of them in some manner and understood them and admits (_see_ subsection

(e) of this rule) that each element is true. _See Henderson v. Morgan,

supra; United States v. Grecco_, 5 M.J. 1018 (C.M.A. 1976); _

United States v. Kilgore_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 35, 44 C.M.R. 89 (1971). _

But see United States v. Pretlow_, 13 M.J. 85 (C.M.A. 1982). 

 Advice

concerning a mandatory minimum punishment would be  required only when the

accused pleads guilty to murder under clause (1) or (4) of Article 118. The

accused could only do so if the case had been referred as not capital. As

to advice concerning the maximum penalty, the adoption of the language of

the federal rule is not intended to eliminate the requirement that the advice

state the maximum including any applicable escalation provisions. As to

misadvice concerning the maximum penalty _ see United States v. Walls

_, 9 M.J. 88 (C.M.A. 1981). 

 Subsection (2) of Fed. R.

 Crim. P. 11(c) has been modified because of the absence of a right to counsel

 in summary courts-martial. _See_ R.C.M.1301(e) and Analysis.

In other courts-martial, full advice concerning counsel would ordinarily

have been given previously (_see_ R.C.M.901(d)(4)) and need

not be repeated here. The discussion is based on paragraph 70 _b_(1)

 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and H.Rep. 491, _supra_ at 23-24,

S.Rep. 486, _supra_ at 20-21. 

 Subsections

(3), (4), and (5) have been taken without substantial change from Fed. R.

Crim. P. 11(c). Subsections (3) and (4) are consistent with the last paragraph

and paragraph 70 _b_ (2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection

(5) corresponds to Mil. R. Evid. 410. As to the effect of failure to give

the advice in subsection (5) _see United States v. Conrad_ ,

598 F.2d 506 (9th Cir. 1979). 

### (d) Ensuring that the plea is voluntary.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d) and is consistent

 with paragraph 70 _b_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). As to the requirement

to inquire concerning the existence of a plea agreement, _see United

 States v. Green_, 1 M.J. 453 (C.M.A. 1976). 

### (e) Determining accuracy of plea.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(f), except that

 "shall" replaces "should" and it is specified that

the military judge must inquire of the accused concerning the factual basis

of the plea. This is required under Article 45(b) and is consistent with

paragraph 70 _b_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ H.R. Rep. 491, _ supra_ at 23-24; S.Rep. 486, _

supra_ at 20-21; _United States v.  Davenport_,

9 M.J. 364 (C.M.A. 1980); _United States v. Johnson_, 1 M.J.

36 (C.M.A. 1975); _ United States v. Logan_, 22 U.S.C.M.A.

349, 47 C.M.R. 1 (1973). Notwithstanding the precatory term "should,"

the factual basis inquiry in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(f) is, in practice, mandatory,

although the means for establishing it are broader. _See_ J.

Moore, _supra_ at Para.11.02(2). _See also ABA Standards,

Pleas of Guilty_ &sect;1.6 (1978). The last sentence requiring that

the accused be placed under oath is designed to ensure compliance with Article

45 and to reduce the likelihood of later attacks on the providence of the

 plea. This is consistent with federal civilian practice. _See_

Fed.R.Evid. 410. 

 The first paragraph in the discussion is also

based on _ United States v. Jemmings_, 1 M.J. 414 (C.M.A.

1976); _United States v. Kilgore, supra; United States v. Care, supra.

See also United States v. Crouch_, 11 M.J. 128 (C.M.A. 1981). 

 The

second paragraph in the discussion is new and is based on _United

States v. Moglia_, 3 M.J. 216 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States

v. Luebs_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 475, 43 C.M.R. 315 (1971); _United

States v. Butler_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 247, 43 C.M.R. 87 (1971). 

### (f) Plea agreement inquiry.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e), with substantial

 modifications to conform to plea agreement procedures in the military. _

See_ R.C.M. 705 and Analysis. The procedures here conform to those

prescribed in _United States v. Green, supra. See also United  States

v. Passini_, 10 M.J. 109 (C.M.A. 1980). 

 It is not intended

 that failure to comply with this subsection will necessarily result in an improvident plea.

 _See United States v. Passini, supra; cf. United States v. Davenport, supra. Contra United States v.  King_, 3 M.J.

458 (C.M.A. 1977). Proceedings in revision may be appropriate to correct

a defect discovered after final adjournment. _United States v. Steck

_, 10 M.J. 412 (C.M.A. 1981). Even if a prejudicial defect in the

agreement is found, as a result of an inadequate inquiry or otherwise, allowing

withdrawal of the plea is not necessarily the appropriate remedy. _

See Santobello v. New York_, 404 U.S. 257 (1971); _United

States v. Kraffa_, 11 M.J. 453 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States

v. Cifuentes_, 11 M.J. 385 (C.M.A. 1981). If an adequate inquiry

is conducted, however, the parties are normally bound by the terms described

on the record. _Id,; United States v. Cooke_ , 11 M.J. 257

 (C.M.A. 1981). _But see United States v. Partin_, 7 M.J. 409

(C.M.A. 1979) (the parties were not bound by military judge's interpretation

which had the effect of adding illegal terms to the agreement; the plea

was held provident). 

### (g) Findings.

This subsection is based on the last paragraph of paragraph 70 _

b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Articles 39(a)(3)

and 52(a)(2). The discussion is new and recognizes that it may be unnecessary

and inappropriate to bring to the member's attention the fact that the accused

has pleaded guilty to some offenses before trial on the merits of others. _

See United States v. Nixon_, 15 M.J. 1028 (A.C.M.R. 1983). _

See also United States v. Wahnon_, 1 M.J. 144 (C.M.A. 1975). 

 _

1990 Amendment:_ The discussion to the subsection was changed in

light of the decision in _United States v. Rivera_, 23 M.J.

89 (C.M.A.), _cert. denied_, 479 U.S. 1091 (1986). 

### (h) Later action.

Subsection (1) is based on the fourth and fifth sentences of the

 penultimate paragraph of paragraph 70 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Note that once a plea of guilty is accepted the accused may withdraw it only

 within the discretion of the military judge. Before the plea is accepted,

the accused may withdraw it as a matter of right. _See United States

v. Leonard_, 16 M.J. 984 (A.C.M.R. 1983); _United States

v. Hayes_, 9 M.J. 825 (N.C.MR. 1980). 

 Subsection (2)

is based on the first two sentences in the penultimate paragraph of paragraph

70 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on Article 45(a). _

See also_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(d). The  discussion is based on _

United States v. Cooper_, 8 M.J. 5 (C.M.A. 1979); _United

States v. Bradley_, 7 M.J. 332 (C.M.A. 1979). Subsection (3) is

based on _United States v. Green, supra. See also United States

v. Kraffa, supra._ 

### (i) Record of proceedings.

This subsection is based on subparagraph (4) of the first paragraph

 of paragraph 70 _b_ of MCM, 1969. _See also_ Article

54; H.R. Rep. No. 491, _ supra_ at 24; S. Rep. No. 486, _

supra_ at 21; _ABA Standards, Pleas of Guilty supra_ at

&sect;1.7. This subsection parallels Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(g), except insofar

as the former allows for nonverbatim records in inferior courts-martial. _

See_ Article 54(b). 

### (j) Waiver.

This subsection replaces the third paragraph in paragraph 70 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which listed some things a guilty plea did

not waive, and which was somewhat misleading in the wake of the pleading

standards under _United States v. Alef_, 3 M.J. 414 (C.M.A.

1977). This subsection is based on _Menna v. New York_, 423

U.S. 61 (1975); _Tollett v. Henderson_, 411 U.S. 258 (1973); _

Parker v. North Carolina_, 397 U.S. 790 (1970); _McMann v.

 Richardson_, 397 U.S. 759 (1970); _Brady v. United States

_, 397 U.S. 742 (1970); _United States v. Engle_,

1 M.J. 387 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v. Dusenberry_, 23

U.S.C.M.A. 287, 49 C.M.R. 536 (1975); _United States v. Hamil_,

15 U.S.C.M.A. 110, 35 C.M.R. 82 (1964). _See also_ subsection

 (a)(2) of this rule and its analysis. 

## Rule 911. Assembly of the court-martial

 The code fixes no specific point in the court-martial for

 assembly although, as noted in the discussion, it establishes assembly as

a point after which the opportunities to change the composition and membership

of the court-martial are substantially circumscribed. _See United

States v.  Morris_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 319, 49 C.M.R. 653 (1975); _

United States v. Dean_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 212, 43 C.M.R. 52 (1970). 

 The

purpose of this rule is simply to require an overt manifestation of assembly

in order to mark clearly for all participants the point at which the opportunities

to elect freely as to composition or to substitute personnel has ended.

Failure to make the announcement described in the rule has no substantive

 effect other than to leave open a dispute as to whether a change in composition

or membership was timely. 

 The rule prescribes no specific point

for assembly. The points noted in the discussion are based on paragraph

61 _j_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It is normally appropriate to

assemble the court-martial at these points to protect the parties from untimely

changes in membership or composition. In some circumstances flexibility

is desirable, as when the military judge approves a request for trial by

military judge alone, but recognizes that it may be necessary to substitute

another judge because of impending delays. The discussion is also based

on paragraphs 53 _d_(2)(c) and 61 _b_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 912. Challenge of selection of members; examination and challenges of members

### (a) Pretrial matters.

Subsection (1) recognizes the usefulness of questionnaires to expedite

voir dire. Questionnaires are already used in some military jurisdictions.

This procedure is analogous to the use of juror qualification forms under

28 U.S.C. &sect; 1864(a). _See also_ ABA Standards, Trial

by Jury &sect; 2.1(b) (1979). It is not intended that questionnaires will

be used as a complete substitute for voir dire. As to investigations of

members, _see also ABA Standards, The Prosecution Function_ &sect;

3-5.3(b) (1979); _The Defense Function_ &sect; 4-7.2(b) (1979). 

 Subsection

(2) recognizes that in order to challenge the selection of the membership

of the court-martial (_see_ subsection (b) of this rule) discovery

of the materials used to select them is necessary. Such discovery is already

common. _See, e.g., United States v. Greene_, 20 U.S.C.M.A.

 232, 43 C.M.R. 72 (1970); _United States v. Herndon_, 50 C.M.R.

 166 (A.C.M.R. 1975); _United States v. Perry_, 47 C.M.R.

89 (A.C.M.R. 1973). The purpose of this procedure is analogous to that

of 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1867(f) and 1868. The rule is a discovery device;

it is not intended to limit the types of evidence which may be admissible

concerning the selection process. 

### (b) Challenge of selection of members.

This subsection is based on 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1867(a), (b) and (d).

 Other subsections in that section are inapposite to the military. No similar

provision appeared in MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Nevertheless, a motion for appropriate

 relief challenging the selection of members and requesting a new one was

 recognized. _See United States v. Daigle_, 1 M.J. 139 (C.M.A.

1975); _United States v. Young_, 49 C.M.R. 133 (A.F.C.M.R.

1974). Except for matters affecting the composition of the court-martial

(_see_ Article 16 and 25(a), (b) and (c)), improper selection

 of members is not a jurisdictional defect. _ United States v. Daigle,

supra._ _See also_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 18th

Sess. 12 (1983). _ Cf. United States v. Blaylock_, 15 M.J.

190 (C.M.A. 1983). The issue may be waived if not raised in a timely manner.

### (c) Stating of grounds for challenge.

This subsection is based on the second sentence of paragraph 62_

b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (d) Examination of members.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(a). Paragraph 62_

b_ and _h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) discussed questioning

members. Paragraph 62_ b_ provided that "... the trial

 or defense counsel may question the court, or individual members thereof." _

United States v. Slubowski_, 7 M.J. 461 (C.M.A. 1979), _reconsideration

not granted by equally divided court_, 9 M.J. 264 (C.M.A. 1980),

held that this provision did not establish a right of the parties to personally

question members. Instead, the court recognized that the procedures in Fed.

R. Crim. P. 24(a) are applicable to the military. _See also United

States v. Parker_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 274, 19 C.M.R. 400 (1955). Therefore,

subsection (d) does not change current practice. 

 The discussion

is based generally on paragraph 62_b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

and encourages permitting counsel to question personally the members. _

See United States v. Slubowski, supra_ at 463 n.4; ABA Standards,

Trial by Jury &sect; 2.4 (1979). As to the scope of voir dire generally, _

see Ristaino v.  Ross_, 424 U.S. 589 (1977); _United States

v. Baldwin_ , 607 F.2d 1295 (9th Cir. 1979); _United States

v. Barnes_, 604 F.2d 121 (2d Cir. 1979); _ United States v.

Slubowski, supra; United States v. Parker, supra._ The second paragraph

of the discussion is based on _ABA Standards, The Prosecution Function

_ &sect; 3-5.3(c). (1979); _The Defense Function_ &sect;  4-7.2(c)

(1979). 

### (e) Evidence.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of paragraph 62_

 h_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (f) Challenges and removal for cause.

 _See generally_ Article 41(a). Subsection (1) is

based on Article 25 and paragraph 62 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The examples in the last paragraph of paragraph 62 _f_ have

 been placed in the discussion. 

 Subsection (2) is based on paragraphs

62 _d_ and _h_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(3) is based on Article 41(a) and paragraph 62_ h_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The first sentence is new. MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was silent on this

matter. The procedure is intended to protect the parties from prejudicial

disclosures before the members, and is in accord with practice in many courts-martial.

Paragraph 62 _h_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) advised that the

military judge "should be liberal in passing on challenges, but need

 not sustain a challenge upon the mere assertion of the challenger."

The precatory language has been deleted from the rule as an unnecessary statement.

This deletion is not intended to change the policy expressed in that statement. 

 The

waiver rule in subsection (4) is based on _United States v. Beer_,

6 U.S.C.M.A. 180, 19 C.M.R. 306 (1955). _See also_ _

United States v. Dyche_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 430, 24 C.M.R. 240 (1957); _

United States v. Wolfe_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 247, 24 C.M.R. 57 (1957).

Grounds (A) and (B) in subsection (f)(1) may not be waived, except as noted. _

See generally_ H. R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong, 1st Sess. 17-18 (1949); _

United States v. Newcomb_, 5 M.J. 4  (C.M.A. 1978). Membership of

enlisted members of the enlisted members of the accused's unit has been held

not to be jurisdictional, and, therefore, may be waived. _United

States v. Wilson_, 16 M.J. 678 (A.C.M.R. 1983); _United States

v. Kimball,_ 13 M.J. 659 (N.M.C.M.R. 1982); _United States

v. Tagert_, 11 M.J. 677 (N.M.C.M.R. 1981); _United States v.

Scott_, 25 C.M.R. 636 (A.B.R. 1957). _ Contra_ _

United States v. Anderson_, 10 M.J. 803 (A.F.C.M.R. 1981). The

Court of Military Appeals has held that the presence of a statutorily ineligible

member is not a jurisdictional defect. _United States v. Miller_,

3 M.J. 326 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Beer, supra._ Ineligibility

of  enlisted members from the accused's unit is designed to protect the

accused from prejudice and does not affect their competency. _See

Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services

_, 81st Cong. 1st Sess. 1140, 1150-52 (1949). _See also_ S.

Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 12(1983). 

 The second sentence

in subsection (4) is based on _United States v. Seabrooks_,

48 C.M.R. 471 (N.C.M.R. 1974). _See also_ _United States

v. Jones_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 283, 22 C.M.R. 73 (1956). This is consistent

with federal practice. _See, e.g., United States v. Richardson_,

582 F.2d 968 (5th Cir. 1978). The third sentence clarifies the effect of

using or failing to use a peremptory challenge after a challenge for cause

is denied. This has been a subject of some controversy. _See United

States v. Harris_, 13 M.J. 288 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States

v. Russell_, 43 C.M.R. 807 (A.C.M.R. 1971) and cases cited therein.

Failure to use a peremptory challenge at all has been held to waive any issue

as to denial of a challenge for cause. _United States v. Henderson

_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 556, 29 C.M.R. 372 (1960). Because the right to

a peremptory challenge is independent to the right to challenge members for

cause, _see_ Article 41, that right should not be forfeited

when a challenge for cause has been erroneously denied. _See United

States v. Baker_, 2 M.J. 773 (A.C.M.R. 1976). _See also_ _

United States v. Rucker_, 557 F.2d 1046 (4th Cir. 1977); _

United States v. Nell_, 526 F.2d 1223 (5th Cir. 1976). _

See generally Swain v. Alabama_, 380 U.S. 202 (1965). The requirement

that a party peremptorily challenging a member it has unsuccessfully challenged

for cause state that it would have peremptorily challenged another member

is designed to prevent a "windfall" to a party which had no intent

 to exercise its preemptory challenge against any other member. _

See United States v. Harris, supra_; _United States v. Shaffer

_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 76, 6 C.M.R. 75 (1952); _United States v.

Cooper_, 8 M.J. 538 (N.C.M.R. 1979).

 _2005 Amendment_:  This rule change is intended to conform military practice to federal practice and limit appellate litigation when the challenged panel member could have been peremptorily challenged or actually did not participate in the trial due to a peremptory challenge by either party.  This amendment is consistent with the President's lawful authority to promulgate a rule that would result in placing before the accused the hard choice faced by defendants in federal district courts - to let the challenged juror sit on the case and challenge the ruling on appeal or to use a peremptory challenge to remove the juror and ensure an impartial jury.  _See United States v. Miles_, 58 M.J. 192 (C.A.A.F. 2003); _United States v. Wiesen_, 56 M.J. 172 (C.A.A.F. 2001), _petition for reconsideration denied_, 57 M.J. 48 (C.A.A.F. 2002); _United States v. Armstrong_, 54 M.J. 51 (C.A.A.F. 2000).

### (g) Peremptory challenges.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 41(b). The second sentence is

new. Paragraph 62 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) stated that a peremptory

challenge "may be used before, during, or after challenges for cause."

Subsection (1) does not prevent a party from exercising a peremptory challenge

before challenges for cause, but it protects a party against being compelled

to use a peremptory challenge before challenges for cause are made. Each

party is entitled to one peremptory challenge. Article 41(b); _United

States v. Calley_, 46 C.M.R. 1131, 1162 (A.C.M.R.), aff'd, 23 U.S.C.M.A.

534, 48 C.M.R. 19 (1973). _But see United States v. Harris, supra

_ at 294 n. 3 (C.M.A. 1982) (Everett, C.J., dissenting). Fed. R.

 Crim. P. 24(b) is inapplicable. 

 _1994 Amendment._ The

Discussion for R.C.M. 912(g)(1) was amended to incorporate _Batson

v. Kentucky_, 476 U.S. 79 (1986); _United States v. Curtis

_, 33 M.J. 101 (C.M.A. 1991), _cert. denied_, 112

S.Ct. 1177 (1992); _United States v. Moore_, 28 M.J. 366

(C.M.A. 1989); and _United States v. Santiago-Davila_, 26 M.J.

 380 (C.M.A. 1988). 

 Subsection (2) is based on _United

States v. White_ , 22 C.M.R. 892 (A.B.R. 1956); _United States

v. Graham_, 14 C.M.R. 645 (A.F.B.R. 1954). _See also_ _

United States v. Fetch_, 17 C.M.R. 836 (A.F.B.R. 1954). The  discussion

is based on the last sentence of paragraph 62_ d_ and the

last sentence of paragraph 62_ h_(4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 The last sentence in the discussion is also based on_United States

v. Lee_, 31 C.M.R. 743 (A.F.B.R. 1962). 

### (h) Special courts-martial without a military judge.

This subsection is based on Articles 41, 51(a), and 52(c) and on

 paragraph 62_ h_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (i) Definitions.

Subsection (2) is based on paragraph 63 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also_ _United States v. Griffin_, 8 M.J. 66

(C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Wilson_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 656,

23 C.M.R. 120 (1957); _United States v. Moore_, 4 U.S.C.M.A.

675, 16 C.M.R. 249 (1954). The distinction between witnesses for the prosecution

and witnesses for the defense has been eliminated for purpose of challenges,

 notwithstanding the statutory basis for the former (Article 25(d)(2)) but

not the latter. Disqualification as a witness for the prosecution has been

held to be waivable. _United  States v. Beer_, 6 U.S.C.M.A.

180, 19 C.M.R. 306 (1955). Consequently, there is no substantive distinction

 between either ground. 

 Subsection (3) is taken from paragraph

64 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _Cf. United States v. Goodman_, 3

M.J. 1 (C.M.A. 1977) (military judge as investigator). 

## Rule 913. Presentation of the case on the merits

### (a) Preliminary instructions.

This subsection is based on Appendix 8 at 10-11 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _See also_ _United States v. Waggoner_, 6

M.J. 77 (C.M.A. 1978). 

 _1990 Amendment:_ The second

sentence to the rule and the discussion which follows are based on the decision

in _United States v. Rivera_, 23 M.J. 89 (C.M.A. 1986). _

See also_ _United States v. Wahnon_, 1 M.J. 144 (C.M.A.

1975). 

### (b) Opening statement.

This subsection is based on the first of paragraph of paragraph

44 _g_(2) and the first paragraph of paragraph 48_

i_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is taken from_ABA Standards,

 The Prosecution Function_ &sect; 3-5.5 (1979); _The

 Defense Function_ &sect; 4-7.4 (1979). 

### (c) Presentation of evidence.

Subsection (1) is based on paragraph 54a of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), except

 that (E), _Additional rebuttal evidence_, has been added

to expressly note the occasional need for further rebuttal. 

 Subsection

(2) is based on the first sentence of Fed. R. Crim. P. 26. The first paragraph

of the discussion of subsection (2) is based on paragraphs 44_ g_(2),

 48_ i_, and 54 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and

Mil. R. Evid. 611 and 614. The second paragraph of the discussion is based

on paragraphs 54 _d_ and _g_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

 Subsection (3) and the discussion are based on paragraph

 54_ e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev). 

 Subsection (4) is

based on paragraph 54_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(5) is based on the fourth sentence of the second paragraph of paragraph

71 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and is consistent with current

practice. 

## Rule 914. Production of statements of witnesses

 _Introduction._ This rule is based on Fed.

R. Crim. P. 26.2. Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2 is based on the Jencks Act, 18

U.S.C. &sect; 3500, which has long been applied in courts-martial. _

United States v. Albo_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 30, 46 C.M.R. 30 (1972); _

United States v. Walbert_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 34, 33 C.M.R. 246 (1963); _

United States v. Heinel_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 259, 26 C.M.R. 39 (1958). _

See United States v. Jarrie_, 5 M.J. 193 (C.M.A. 1978); _ United

States v. Herndon_, 5 M.J. 175 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States

v. Scott_, 6 M.J. 547  (A.F.C.M.R. 1978) (applied to statements

made during Article 32 investigation and demand at trial); _ United

States v. Calley_, 46 C.M.R. 1131 (A.C.M.R.), _aff'd_,

22 U.S.C.M.A. 534, 48 C.M.R. 19 (1973); Kesler, _The Jencks Act: An

Introductory Analysis_, 13 The Advocate 391 (Nov- Dec. 1981); Lynch, _

Possession Under the Jencks Act_, 10 A.F.JAG Rptr 177 (Dec. 1981);

O'Brien, _The Jencks Act- A Recognized Tool for Military Defense Counsel

_ , 11 The Advocate 20 (Jan- Fed 1979); Waldrop, _The Jencks

Act_, 20 A.F.L. Rev. 93 (1978); Bogart, _Jencks Act_,

27 JAG J. 427 (1973); West, _Significance of the Jencks Act in Military

 Law_, 30 Mil. L. Rev. 83 (1965). Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2 expands the

Jencks Act by providing for disclosure by the defense as well as the prosecution,

based on _United States v. Nobles_, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). Otherwise,

 it is not intended to change the requirements of the Jencks Act. Fed. R.

Crim. P. 26.2 Advisory Committee Note (Supp. v. 1981). Prosecution compliance

 with R.C.M. 701 should make resort to this rule by the defense unnecessary

in most cases. 

 This rule, like Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2, applies

at trial. It is not a discovery rule (_United States v. Ciesielski

_, 39 C.M.R. 839 (N.M.C.R. 1968)), and it does not apply to Article

32 hearings (_contra_, _United States v. Jackson_,

33 C.M.R. 884, 890 nn.3, 4 (A.F.B.R. 1963)). It is a distinct rule from the

rule requiring production for inspection by an opponent of memoranda used

by a witness to refresh recollection. _United States v. Ellison_,

46 C.M.R. 839 (A.F.C.M.R. 1972); _cf._ Mil. R. Evid. 612

and accompanying Analysis. The rule is not intended to discourage voluntary

disclosure before trial, even where R.C.M. 701 does not require disclosure,

so as to avoid delays at trial. Further, this rule does not foreclose other

avenues of discovery. 

### (a) Motion for production.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(a). It has been

 reworded to clarify what statements must be produced. "(I)n the possession

of the United States," and "in the possession of the accused

or defense counsel" are substituted for "in their possession"

 to make clear that the rule is not limited to statements in the personal

possession of counsel. _ See_ 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3500(a). As

to the meaning of "in the possession of the United States," _

 see United States v. Calley, supra_ (testimony at congressional

hearing); _see also United States v. Ali_, 12 M.J. 1018

(A.C.M.R. 1982) (statements in possession of commander); _United States

 v. Boiser_, 12 M.J. 1010 (A.C.M.R. 1982) (notes of undercover informant); _

United States v. Fountain_, 2 M.J. 1202 (N.C.M.R. 1976); _

United States v. Brakefield_, 43 C.M.R. 828 (A.C.M.R. 1971) (notes

taken by government psychiatrist). 

### (b) Production of entire statement.

This subsection is taken from Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(b). 

### (c) Production of excised statement.

This subsection is taken from Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(c). Failure

of a judge to make the required examination on request is error. _

United States v. White_, 37 C.M.R. 791 (A.F.B.R. 1966) (decision

under Jencks Act). Failure to preserve the statement after denial or excision

frustrates appellate review and is also error under decisions interpreting

18 U.S.C. &sect; 3500. _United States v. Dixon_, 8 M.J. 149

(C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Jarrie, supra._ However,

the statement need not be appended to the record (where it would become

public) because it is not error to consider the statement when forwarded

separately as this rule provides. _United States v. Dixon, supra._

### (d) Recess for examination of the statement.

This subsection is taken from Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(d). 

### (e) Remedy for failure to produce statement.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(e). Although not

 expressly mentioned there, the good faith loss and harmless error doctrines

under the Jencks Act would apparently apply. _See United States v.

Patterson_, 10 M.J. 599 (A.F.C.M.R. 1980); _United States

v. Kilmon_, 10 M.J. 543 (N.C.M.R. 1980), _United States v.

Dixon, United States v. Scott, United States v. Jarrie, and United States

v. White, all supra._ Note, however, that under the Jencks Act decisions

the  accused need not demonstrate prejudice on appeal (_United States

v. Albo, supra;_ _but see United States v. Bryant_,

439 F.2d 642 (D.C. Cir. 1971); _United States v. Ali_, and_

 United States v. Boiser_, both _supra_) and that

the military judge may not substitute the judge's assessment of the usefulness

of the statement for the assessment of the accused and defense counsel _

 (United States v. Dixon and United States v. Kilmon_, both_

 supra)._ 

### (f) Definitions.

This subsection is taken from Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.6(f). 

 In

subsection (1) the inclusion of statements approved or adopted by a witness

is consistent with 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3500(e)(1). _ See United States

v. Jarrie_ and _ United States v. Kilmon_, both _

supra._ 

 In subsection (2) the inclusion of substantially

verbatim recordings or transcriptions exceeds some interpretations under

18 U.S.C. &sect; 3500. _See, e.g., United States v. Matfield_,

4 M.J. 843 (A.C.M.R.), _pet. denied.,_ 5 M.J. 182 (1978) (testimony

in a prior court-martial not accessible under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3500 but

accessible under a general "military due process" right to discovery).

## Rule 914A. Use of remote live testimony of a child

 _1999 Amendment:_ This rule allows the military

judge to determine what procedure to use when taking testimony under Mil.

R. Evid. 611(d)(3). It states that normally such testimony should be taken

via a two-way closed circuit television system. The rule further prescribes

the procedures to be used if a television system is employed. The use of

two-way closed circuit television, to some degree, may defeat the purpose

of these alternative procedures, which is to avoid trauma to children. In

such cases, the judge has discretion to direct one-way television communication.

The use of one-way closed circuit television was approved by the Supreme

Court in _Maryland v. Craig_, 497 U.S. 836 (1990). This amendment

also gives the accused an election to absent himself from the courtroom

to prevent remote testimony. Such a provision gives the accused a greater

role in determining how this issue will be resolved.

 _2007 Amendment_:  The rule was amended to allow for technological advances in the methods used to transmit audio and visual information.

## Rule 914B. Use of remote testimony.

_2007 Amendment_:  This rule describes the basic procedures that will be used when testimony of any witnesses, other than child witnesses pursuant to R.C.M. 914A, is received via remote means.

## Rule 915. Mistrial

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on the second and third sentences of paragraph

56 _e_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See generally Oregon

v. Kennedy_, 456 U.S. 667 (1982); _Arizona v. Washington

_, 434 U.S. 497 (1978); _ Lee v. United States_, 432

U.S. 23 (1977); _United States v.  Dinitz_, 424 U.S. 600 (1976); _

Illinois v. Somerville_ , 410 U.S. 458 (1973); _United States

v. Jorn_, 400 U.S. 470 (1971); _United States v. Perez_,

22 U.S. (9  Wheat) 579 (1824); _United States v. Richardson_,

21 U.S.C.M.A. 54, 44 C.M.R. 108 (1971); _United States v. Schilling

_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 482, 22 C.M.R. 272 (1957). 

### (b) Procedure.

This subsection is based on paragraph 56 _e_(2) of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Because consent or lack thereof by the defense to a mistrial

may be determinative of a former jeopardy motion at a second trial, the

views of the defense must be sought. 

### (c) Effect of a declaration of mistrial.

Subsection (1) is based on the first sentence of paragraph 56 _

 e_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note that dismissal of charges may have

the same effect as declaring a mistrial, depending on the grounds for dismissal. _

See Lee v. United States_ and _Illinois v. Somerville,_ both _

supra._ Subsection (2) is based on the first two sentences of  paragraph

56_ e_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev). _See also_ _

Oregon v. Kennedy, supra; United States v. Scott_, 437 U.S. 82 (1978); _

Arizona v. Washington, United States v. Dinitz, Illinois v. Somerville_,

and _United States v. Jorn, all supra; Gori v. United States_,

367 U.S. 364 (1961); _United States v. Richardson, supra._ Subsection

(2) notes, as paragraph 56 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) did not,

that a declaration of a mistrial after findings does not trigger double jeopardy

 protections. _See United States v. Richardson, supra._ Moreover

 subsection (2) notes that certain types of prosecutorial misconduct resulting

in mistrial will trigger double jeopardy protections. _See United

 States v. Jorn_, and _United States v. Gori,_ both_

 supra._ _See also _ _ United States v. Dinitz

_, and_ Illinois v. Sommerville,_ both _supra.

_ 

## Rule 916. Defenses

### (a) In general.

This subsection and the discussion are based on the third paragraph

 of paragraph 214 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Motions in bar of trial,

which were also covered in paragraph 214, are now covered in R.C.M. 907

since they are procedurally and conceptually different from the defenses

treated in R.C.M. 916. 

### (b) Burden of proof.

This subsection is based on the fourth paragraph of paragraph 214

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ paragraph 112 _a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See, e.g., United States v. Cuffee_, 10

M.J. 381 (C.M.A. 1981). The first paragraph in the discussion is based

on the fifth paragraph of paragraph 214 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second paragraph

in the discussion is based on _United States v. Garcia_, 1

M.J. 26 (C.M.A. 1975); _United States v. Walker_,  21 U.S.C.M.A.

376, 45 C.M.R.150 (1972); _United States v. Ducksworth_,

13 U.S.C.M.A. 515, 33 C.M.R. 47 (1963); _United States v. Bellamy

_, 47 C.M.R. 319 (A.C.M.R. 1973). It is unclear whether, under some

 circumstances, an accused's testimony may negate a defense which might otherwise

have been raised by the evidence. _See United States v. Garcia, supra.

_ 

 _1986 Amendment:_ The requirement that

the accused prove lack of mental responsibility was added to implement Article

50 _a_, which was added to the UCMJ in the "Military

Justice Amendments of 1986," Tit. VIII, &sect; 802, National Defense

Authorization Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub.L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905

(1986). Article 50a(b) adopted the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 20(b), created

by the Insanity Defense Reform Act, ch. IV, Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat.

2057 (1984). _See generally Jones v. United States_, 463

U.S. 354, 103 S. Ct. 3043, 3051 n.17 (1983); _Leland v. Oregon_,

343 U.S. 790, 799 (1952); S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 224-25 (1983),

reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 1, 226-27. 

 _

1998 Amendment:_ In enacting section 1113 of the National Defense

Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186,

462 (1996), Congress amended Article 120, UCMJ, to create a mistake of fact

defense to a prosecution for carnal knowledge. The accused must prove by

a preponderance of the evidence that the person with whom he or she had sexual

intercourse was at least 12 years of age, and that the accused reasonably

believed that this person was at least 16 years of age. The changes to R.C.M.

916(b) and (j) implement this amendment.

 _2007 Amendment_:  Changes to this paragraph, deleting "carnal knowledge", are based on section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006, which supersedes the previous paragraph 45, Rape and Carnal Knowledge, in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct.

 _2015 Amendment_. Changes to this paragraph are based on section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011, which superseded the previous paragraph 45, "Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct," in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with "Rape and sexual assault generally." In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 added paragraph 45b, "Rape and sexual assault of a child," and paragraph 45c, "Other sexual misconduct".

### (c) Justification.

This subsection and the discussion are based on paragraph 216_

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United

States v. Evans._ 17 U.S.C.M.A. 238, 38 C.M.R. 36 (1967); _

United States v. Regalado_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 480, 33 C.M.R. 12 (1963); _

United States v. Hamilton_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 130, 27 C.M.R. 204 (1959).

The last sentence in the discussion is based on the second sentence of paragraph

195_ b_ of MCM (1951). 

### (d) Obedience to orders.

This subsection is based on paragraph 216_d_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Calley_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 534,

48 C.M.R. 19 (1973); _United States v. Cooley_, 16 U.S.C.M.A.

24, 36 C.M.R. 180 (1966). _See also_ _United States

v. Calley_, 46 C.M.R. 1131 (A.C.M.R. 1973). 

### (e) Self-defense.

Subsection (1) is based on the first paragraph of paragraph 216

 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on the

second paragraph of paragraph 216 _ c_ of MCM 1967 (Rev.). _

See also_ _United States v. Jackson_, 15 U.S.C.M.A.

603, 36 C.M.R. 101 (1966). 

 Subsection (2) is new and is based

on _United States v. Acosta-Vergas_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 388, 32

C.M.R. 388 (1962). 

 Subsection (3) is based on the fourth paragraph

of paragraph 216_ c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ _United States v. Sawyer_, 4 M.J. 64 (C.M.A. 1977).

The second paragraph in the discussion is based on _United States

v. Jones_, 3 M.J. 279 (1977). _See also_ _

United States v. Thomas,_ 11 M.J. 315 (C.M.A. 1981). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ References to subsections "(c)(1) or (2)"

was changed to "(e)(1) or (2)" to correct an error in MCM, 1984. 

 Subsection

(4) is based on the third paragraph of paragraph 216 _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United States v. Yabut

_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 393, 43 C.M.R. 233 (1971); _United States

v. Green_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 545, 33 C.M.R. 77 (1963); _United

States v. Brown_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 485, 33 C.M.R. 7  (1963). The second

paragraph in the discussion is based on _United States v. Smith_,

13 U.S.C.M.A. 471, 33 C.M.R. 3 (1963). 

 Subsection (5) is based

on paragraph 216c of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which described self-defense in terms

which also apply to defense of another. It is also based on _United

States v. Styron_, 21 C.M.R. 579 (C.G.B.R. 1956); _United

States v. Hernandez_, 19 C.M.R. 822 (A.F.B.R. 1955). _But

see_ R. Perkins, _Criminal Law_ 1018-1022 (2d ed.

1969). 

### (f) Accident.

This subsection and the discussion are based on paragraph 216_

 b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United

States v. Tucker_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 551, 38 C.M.R. 349 (1968); _

United States v. Redding_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 242, 24 C.M.R. 22 (1963); _

United States v. Sandoval_, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 61, 15 C.M.R. 61 (1954); _

United States v. Small_, 45 C.M.R. 700 (A.C.M.R. 1972). 

### (g) Entrapment.

This subsection and the discussions are based on paragraph 216_

 e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United

States v. Vanzandt_, 14 M.J. 332 (C.M.A. 1982). 

### (h) Coercion or duress.

This subsection is based on paragraph 216 _f_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Paragraph 216 _f_ required that the fear

of the accused be that the accused would be harmed. This test was too narrow,

as the fear of injury to relatives or others may be a basis for this defense. _

United States v. Jemmings_, 1 M.J. 414 (C.M.A. 1976); _United

States v. Pinkston_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 261, 39 C.M.R. 261 (1969). The

discussion is based on _United States v. Jemmings, supra._

### (i) Inability.

This subsection is based on paragraph 216 _g_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See United States v. Cooley, supra; United States

v. Pinkston_ , 6 U.S.C.M.A. 700, 21 C.M.R. 22 (1956); _United

States v. Heims_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 418, 12 C.M.R. 174 (1953). 

### (j) Ignorance or mistake of fact.

This subsection is based on paragraph 216 _i_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Jenkins_, 22 U.S.C.M.A.

365, 47 C.M.R. 120 (1973); _United States v. Hill_, 13 U.S.C.M.A.

158, 32 C.M.R. 158, (1962); _United States v. Greenwood_,

_, 3 M.J. 962 (N.C.M.R.), _pet  denied_, 4 M.J. 124

(1977); _United States v. Coker_, 2. M.J. 304 (A.F.C.M.R. 1976),

rev'd on other grounds, 4 M.J. 93 (C.M.A. 1977). _See also_ _

United States v. Calley_, 46 C.M.R. 1131, 1179 (A.C.M.R. 1973), _

aff'd_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 534, 48 C.M.R. 19 (1973). 

 _

1998 Amendment:_ In enacting section 1113 of the National Defense

Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186,

462(1996), Congress amended Article 120, UCMJ to create a mistake of fact

defense to a prosecution for carnal knowledge. The accused must prove by

a preponderance of the evidence that the person with whom he or she had sexual

intercourse was at least 12 years of age, and that the accused reasonably

believed that this person was at least 12 years of age, and that the accused

reasonably believed that this person was at least 16 years of age. The changes

to R.C.M. 916(b) and (j) implement this amendment.

 _2007 Amendment_:  Changes to this paragraph, deleting "carnal knowledge" and consistent language, are based on section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006, which supersedes the previous paragraph 45, Rape and Carnal Knowledge, in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct.

 Paragraph (j)(3) is new and is based on the mistake of fact defense incorporated in section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006, which supersedes the previous paragraph 45, Rape and Carnal Knowledge, in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct.

 _2015 Amendment_. Changes to this paragraph are based on section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011, which superseded the previous paragraph 45, "Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct," in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with "Rape and sexual assault generally." In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 added paragraph 45b, "Rape and sexual assault of a child," and paragraph 45c, "Other sexual misconduct".

 Paragraph (j)(3) was deleted based on the changes to Article 120 and in light of the fact that CAAF ruled that the statutory burden shift to the accused in the 2007 version of Article 120 was unconstitutional and the subsequent burden shift to the government to disprove consent beyond a reasonable doubt once the accused had raised the affirmative defense of consent by a preponderance of the evidence resulted in a legal impossibility. _United States v. Prather_, 69 M.J. 338 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. Medina_, 69 M.J. 462 (C.A.A.F. 2011).

### (k) Lack of mental responsibility.

Subsection (1) is taken from paragraph 120 _b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev). _See also_ _United States v. Frederick

_, 3 M.J. 230 (C.M.A. 1977). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ The

test for lack of mental responsibility in subsection (1) was changed to

implement Article 50a, which was added to the UCMJ in the "Military

 Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII, 802, National Defense Authorization

Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub.L. No. 99-661, 100 stat. 3905 (1986).  Article

50a is modeled on 18 U.S.C. 20. _See_ Insanity Defense Reform

Act, ch. IV, Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2057 (1984). The new test deletes

the volitional prong of the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code Standard

(_see United States v. Lyons_, 731 F.2d 243 (5th Cir. 1984)

(en banc), _cert. denied_, 105 S. Ct. 323 (1985)), which was

 applied to courts-martial in _United States v. Frederick_,

 3 M.J. 230 (C.M.A. 1977). The new standard also changes the quantity of

 mental disability necessary to establish the defense from "lacks substantial

capacity to appreciate" to being "unable to appreciate."

 The new test is very similar to the test in _M'Naghten's Case_,

 10 Cl. & F. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (House of Lords. 1843). _See

also_ Carroll, _Insanity Defense Reform_, 114 Mil.

L. Rev. 183 (1986). 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ The Discussion

to R.C.M. 916(k)(1) was amended to add a cross-reference to R.C.M. 1102A.

 Subsection

(2) is taken from paragraph 120 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ _United States v. Higgins_, 4 U.S.C.M.A.

143, 15 C.M.R. 143  (1954). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subsection

(2) was amended to eliminate the defense of partial mental responsibility

in conformance with Article 50a, which was added to the UCMJ in the "Military

Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII 802, National Defense Authorization

Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub.L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986). Article

50a(a) is adopted from 18 U.S.C. &sect; 20(a). Congress wrote the last sentence

of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 20(a) (now also the last sentence of Article 50(a)) "to

insure that the insanity defense is not improperly resurrected in the guise

of showing some other affirmative defense, such as that the defendant had

has a 'diminished responsibility' on some similarly asserted

state of mind which would serve to excuse the offense and open the door,

once again, to needlessly confusing psychiatric testimony." S.Rep.

No. 225, 98th Cong. 1st Sess. 229(1983), _reprinted in_ 1984

U.S.Code Cong. & Ad. News 1. 231. _See Muench v. Israel,_ 715

F.2d 1124 (7th Cir. 1983), _cert. denied,_ 104 S.Ct. 2682

(1984); _State v. Wilcox_, 436 N.E. 2d 523 (Ohio 1982). 

 Because

the language of section 20(a) and its legislative history have been contended

to be somewhat ambiguous regarding "diminished capacity" or "diminished

 responsibility," this aspect of the legislation has been litigated

in Article III courts. _United States v. Pohlot_, Crim. No.

 85-00354-01 (E.D. Pa. March 31, 1986) held that section 20(a) eliminated

the defense of diminished capacity. _See also_ _United

States v. White_, 766 F.2d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1985); U.S. DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE, HANDBOOK ON THE COMPREHENSIVE CRIME CONTROL ACT OF 1984 AND OTHER

CRIMINAL STATUTES ENACTED BY THE 98TH CONGRESS 58, 60 (December 1984). _

Contra_ _United States v.  Frisbee_, 623 F. Supp.

1217 (N.D. Cal. 1985) (holding that Congress did not intend to eliminate

the defense of diminished capacity). _See also_ Carroll,_

Insanity Defense Reform,_ 114 Mil. L. Rev. 183, 196 (1986). The

drafters concluded that Congress intended to eliminate this defense in section

20(a). 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ Subsection (k)(2) was

modified to clarify that evidence of an accused's impaired mental state may

be admissible. _See United States v. Schap,_ 49 M.J. 317 (1998); _

United States v. Berri,_ 33 M.J. 337 (C.M.A. 1991); _Ellis

v. Jacob,_ 26 M.J. 90 (C.M.A. 1988).

 Subsection (3)(A)

and the discussion are based on paragraph 122 _a_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). Several matters in paragraph 122a are covered in other parts

of this subsection or in R.C.M. 909. 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ Subsection (3)(A) was amended to conform to article 50a(b) and

R.C.M. 916(b). 

 Subsection (3)(B) and the discussion are based

on paragraph 122 _b_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The procedures

for an inquiry into the mental responsibility of the accused are covered

in R.C.M. 706. 

 Subsection (3)(C) is new. Article 51(b) prohibits

a military judge from ruling finally on the factual question of mental responsibility.

It does not, however, require that the question be treated as an interlocutory

one, and there is no apparent reason for doing so. The import of Article

51(b) is that the issue of mental responsibility may not be removed from

the factfinder. Moreover, to permit mental responsibility to be treated separately

from other issues relating to the general issue could work to the detriment

of the accused. _Cf._ _United States v. Laws_,

11 M.J. 475 (C.M.A. 1981). 

(1)_ Not defenses generally._ 

 Subsection

(1) is based on the first sentence of paragraph 216 _j_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on the remainder of paragraph 216 _

j_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); R. Perkins, _supra_ at 920-38. _

## Rule 917. Motion for a finding of not guilty

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a) and on the first

 two sentences of paragraph 71 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Paragraph

71 _a_ did not expressly provide for a motion for a finding

of not guilty to be made _sua sponte_, as does Fed. R. Crim.

P. 29(a). Unlike Fed. R. Crim. P. 29, this rule requires the motion to be

resolved before findings are entered. If the evidence is insufficient to

support a rational finding of guilty, there is no reason to submit the issue

to the members. That would be inefficient. Moreover, if a military judge

set aside some but not all of the findings as "irrational,"

it would be awkward to proceed to sentencing before the same members. However,

nothing in this rule is intended to limit the authority of a military judge

to dismiss charges after findings on other grounds, such as multiplicity

or improper findings (_e.g.,_ conviction for both larceny

as perpetrator and receiving stolen property, _see United States

v. Cartwright_, 13 M.J. 174 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States

v. Ford_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 3, 30 C.M.R. 3 (1960);_cf._ _

United States v. Clark_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 140, 42 C.M.R. 332 (1970)).

### (b) Form of motion.

This subsection is based on the first sentence in the second paragraph

of paragraph 71 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), except that now

a statement of the deficiencies of proof is required. This will enable the

trial counsel to respond to the motion. 

### (c) Procedure.

This subsection is new, although it conforms to current practice.

By ensuring that counsel may be heard on the motion, a precipitant ruling

will be avoided. This is important since a ruling granting the motion may

not be reconsidered. _See United States v. Hitchcock_, 6 M.J.

188 (C.M.A. 1979). The first paragraph in the discussion is based on the

fifth sentence of the second paragraph of paragraph 71 _a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (d) Standard.

This subsection is based on the fourth sentence of the second paragraph

of paragraph 71 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ _Jackson v. Virginia_, 443 U.S. 307 (1979); _

United States v. Varkonyi_, 645 F.2d 453 (5th Cir. 1981); _

United States v. Beck_, 615 F.2d 441 (7th Cir. 1980). 

### (e) Motion as to greater offense.

This subsection is new and is intended to resolve the problem noted

 in _United States v. Spearman_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 31, 48 C.M.R.

405 (1974). _See_ _Government of Virgin Islands v.

 Josiah_, 641 F.2d 1103, 1108 (3d Cir. 1981). 

### (f) Effect of ruling.

This subsection is based on the third sentence of Article 51(a)

and on _United States v. Hitchcock, supra._ 

 _

1994 Amendment._ The amendment to subsection (f) clarifies that the

military judge may reconsider a ruling denying a motion for a finding of

not guilty at any time prior to authentication of the record of trial.

This amendment is consistent with _United States v. Griffith_,

 27 M.J. 42 (C.M.A. 1988).  As stated by the court, the reconsideration is

limited to a determination as to whether the evidence adduced is legally

sufficient to establish guilt rather than a determination based on the weight

of the evidence which remains the exclusive province of the finder of fact.

### (g) Effect of denial on review.

This subsection is based on the last sentence of the first paragraph

 of paragraph 71 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

United States v. Bland_, 653 F.2d 989 (5th Cir.), _cert. denied

_, 454 U.S. 1055 (1981). 

## Rule 918. Findings

### (a) General findings.

This subsection and the discussion are based on paragraphs 74 _

 b_ and _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion of

lesser included offenses is also based on Article 80. _See also_ _

United States v. Scott_, 50 C.M.R. 630 (C.G.C.M.R. 1975). 

 Failure

to reach findings as to the charge or the designation of a wrong article

is not necessarily prejudicial. _United States v. Dilday_,

471 C.M.R. 172 (A.C.M.R. 1973). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ The

 provisions allowing for  findings of not guilty only by reason of lack

of mental responsibility were added to subsections (a)(1) and (2) to implement

Article 50a(c), which was added to the UCMJ in the "Military Justice

Amendments of 1986," Tit. VIII, 802, National Defense Authorization

 Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub.L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986). This

 finding is modeled after 18 U.S.C. &sect; 4242(b)(3), section 403 of the

Insanity Defense Reform Act, ch. IV, Pub.L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2057, 2059.

The drafters intended that adoption of the finding of "not guilty only

by reason of lack of mental responsibility" does not require conformance

 to the procedures that follow an insanity acquittal in federal courts

 (_see_ U.S.C. &sect; 4243 _et. seq_.). The

Services are free to use available  medical and administrative procedures

which address disposition of servicemembers having psychiatric illnesses.

 The drafters further intended that, for purposes of subsequent appellate

and other legal reviews under this Manual, a finding of "not guilty

only by reason of lack of mental responsibility" shall be treated as

any other acquittal. 

 _1993 Amendment:_ The amendment

to R.C.M. 918(a)(1) allows for a finding of guilty of a named lesser included

offense of the charged offense, and eliminates the necessity of making findings

by exceptions and substitutions. This serves to conform military practice

to that used in criminal trials before federal district courts. _

See_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 31(c); E. Devitt and C. Blackman, _

Federal Jury Practice and Instructions,_ 18.07 (1977). The practice

of using exceptions and substitutions is retained for those cases in which

the military judge or court members must conform the findings to the evidence

actually presented, _e.g.,_ a larceny case in which the finding

is that the accused stole several of the items alleged in the specification

but not others. 

### (b) Special findings.

This subsection is based on Article 51(d), paragraph 74_

 i_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Gerard_,

11 M.J. 440 (C.M.A. 1981). _ See also_ _United States

v. Pratcher_ 14  M.J. 819 (A.C.M.R. 1982); _United States

v. Burke_, 4 M.J. 530 (N.C.M.R. 1977); _United States v. Hussey

_, 1 M.J. 804 (A.F.C.M.R. 1976); _United States v. Baker_,

47 C.M.R. 506 (A.C.M.R. 1973); _United States v. Falin_, 43

C.M.R. 702 (A.C.M.R. 1971); _United States v. Robertson_,

41 C.M.R. 457 (A.C.M.R. 1969); Schinasi, _Special Findings: Their

Use at Trial and on Appeal,_ 87 Mil.L.Rev. (Winter 1980). 

 The

requirement that a request for special findings be made before  general findings

 are announced is based on the fifth sentence of paragraph 74 _i_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), and on Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(c). Article 51(d) is patterned

after Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(c). _ United States v. Gerard, supra._

The language in Article 51(d) is virtually identical to that in Fed. R. Crim.

 P. 23(c) as it existed when Article 51(d) was adopted in 1968. Fed. R. Crim.

P. 23(c) was amended in 1977 to provide specifically that a request for

special findings be made before general findings are entered. Pub. L. No.

 95-78 &sect; 2(b), 91 Stat. 320. This was done "to make clear

that deadline for making a request for findings of fact and to provide

that findings may be oral." _Id.,_ Advisory Committee

Note (Supp. v. 1981). Subsection (b), therefore, continues conformity with

federal practice. 

### (c) Basis of findings.

This subsection and the discussion are based on paragraph 74 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion of reasonable doubt has been

modified based on _United States v. Cotten_, 10 M.J. 260

 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Salley_, 9 M.J. 189 (C.M.A.

 1980). _See also_ _Holland v. United States_,

348 U.S. 121, 140-41 (1954); _United States v. Previte_, 648

F.2d 73 (1st Cir. 1981); _United States v. De Vincent_, 632

F.2d 147 (1st Cir.), _cert denied_, 449 U.S. 986 (1980); _

States v. Zeigler_, 14 M.J. 860 (A.C.M.R. 1982); _United States

1980); E. Devitt and C. Blackmar, _Federal Jury Practice Instructions,

_ &sect; 11.14 (3d. ed. 1977). As to instructions concerning

 accomplice testimony, _see United States v. Lee_, 6 M.J.

96 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Moore_, 8 M.J. 738 (A.F.C.M.R.

1980), _ aff'd,_ 10 M.J. 405 (C.M.A. 1981) (regarding corroboration).

## Rule 919. Argument by counsel on findings

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.1. It has been

reworded slightly to make clear that trial counsel may waive the opening

and the closing argument. The rule is consistent with the first sentence

of paragraph 72 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Contents.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of the second paragraph

of paragraph 72 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is

based on paragraphs 72 _ a_ and _b_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). _See also_ paragraphs 44 _g_ and

48 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _Griffin v. California

### (c) Waiver of objection to improper argument.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.1 and is generally

 consistent with current practice. _See United States v. Grandy_,

11 M.J. 270 (C.M.A. 1981). _See also_ _United States

v. Doctor_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 126, 21 C.M.R. 252 (1956). _But see

was plain). As to the discussion, _see United States v. Knickerbocker

_, and _United States v. Nelson_, both _supra;

_ _United States v. O'Neal_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 33, 36 C.M.R.

189 (1966); _United States v. Carpenter_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 418,

29 C.M.R. 234 (1960). 

## Rule 920. Instructions on findings

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of paragraph 73 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on the first paragraph

of paragraph 73 _ a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See United

States v. Buchana_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 394, 41 C.M.R. 394 (1970); _

United States v. Harrison_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 179, 41 C.M.R. 179 (1970); _

United States v. Moore_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 375, 36 C.M.R. 531 (1966); _

United States v. Smith_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 471, 33 C.M.R. 3(1963). _

See also_ _United States v. Gere_, 662 F.2d 1291 (9th

Cir. 1981). 

### (b) When given.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of paragraph 73 _

a_ and on paragraph 74 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), and

is consistent with Fed. R. Crim. P. 30. This subsection expressly provides

 that additional instructions may be given after deliberations have begun

 without a request from the members. MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was silent on this

point. The discussion is based on _ United States v. Ricketts_,

1 M.J. 78 (C.M.A. 1975). 

 _1993 Amendment:_ The

amendment to R.C.M. 920(b) is  based on the 1987 amendments to Federal Rule

of Criminal Procedure 30. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30 was amended

to permit instructions either before or after arguments by counsel. The previous

version of R.C.M. 920 was based on the now superseded version of the federal

rule. 

 The purpose of this amendment is to give the court discretion

to instruct the members before or after closing arguments or at both times.

The amendment will permit courts to continue instructing the members after

arguments as Rule 30 and R.C.M. 920(b) had previously required. It will also

permit courts to instruct before arguments in order to give the parties an

opportunity to argue to the jury in light of the exact language used by

the court. _See United States v. Slubowski_, 7 M.J. 461 (C.M.A

1979); _United States  v. Pendry_, 29 M.J. 694 (A.C.M.R. 1989).

### (c) Requests for instructions.

This subsection is based on the first three sentences in Fed. R.

 Crim. P. 30 and on the second and fourth sentences of paragraph 73 _

d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on the remainder

of paragraph 73 _d_. 

### (d) How given.

The first sentence of this subsection is based on the last paragraph

 of paragraph 73 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence

of this subsection permits the use of written copies of instructions without

stating a preference for or against them. _See United States v.  Slubowski

_, 7 M.J. 461 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Muir_,

20 U.S.C.M.A. 188, 43 C.M.R. 28 (1970); _United States v. Sampson

_, 7 M.J. 513 (A.C.M.R. 1979); _ United States v. Sanders

_, 30 C.M.R. 521 (A.C.M.R. 1961). Only copies of instructions given

orally may be provided, and delivery of only a portion of the oral instructions

to the members in writing is prohibited when a party objects. This should

eliminate the potential problems associated with written instructions. _

See United States v. Slubowski, supra; United States v. Caldwell_,

11 U.S.C.M.A. 257, 29 C.M.R. 73 (1960); _ United States v. Helm_,

21 C.M.R. 357 (A.B.R. 1956). Giving written instructions is never required.

The discussion is based on the last paragraph of paragraph 73 _a

_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and _United States v. Caldwell, supra.

_ As to the use of written instructions in federal district courts, _

see generally United States v. Read_, 658 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir. 1981); _

United States v. Calabrase_, 645 F.2d 1379 (10th Cir.), _

cert. denied_, 454 U.S. 831 (1981). 

### (e) Required instructions.

This subsection is based on Article 51(c) and on the first paragraph

 of paragraph 73 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ _United States v. Steinruck_, 11 M.J. 322 (C.M.A.

1981); _United States v. Moore, supra;_ _United States

v. Clark_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 201, 2 C.M.R. 107 (1952). As to whether the

defense may affirmatively waive certain instructions (_e.g.,_ lesser

 included offenses) which might otherwise be required, _see United

 States v. Johnson_, 1 M.J. 137 (C.M.A. 1975); _United States

v. Mundy_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 500, 9 C.M.R. 130 (1953). _See generally

_ Cooper, _The Military Judge: More Than a Mere Reference,

_ The Army Lawyer (Aug. 1976) 1; Hilliard, _The Waiver Doctrine:

Is It Still Viable?,_ 18 A.F.L. Rev. 45 (Spring 1976). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (2) was amended to require the accused

to waive the bar of the statute of limitations if the accused desires instructions

on any lesser included offense otherwise barred. _Spaziano v. Florida

_, 468 U.S. 447 (1984). This overturns the holdings in _United

States v. Wiedemann_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 356, 36 C.M.R. 521 (1966) and _

United States v. Cooper_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 390, 37 C.M.R. 10 (1966).

The same rule applies in trials by military judge alone. Article 51(d). This

is consistent with Article 79 because an offense raised by the evidence but

 barred by the statute of limitations is "necessarily included in the

 offense charged," unless the accused waives the statute of limitations. 

 The

first paragraph in the discussion is based on _United States v. Jackson

_, 12 M.J. 163 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Waldron_,

11 M.J. 36 (C.M.A. 19810; _United States v. Evans_, 17 U.S.C.M.A.

238, 38 C.M.R. 36 (1967); _United States v. Clark, supra. See United

States v. Johnson_, 637 F.2d 1224 (9th Cir. 1980); _United

States v. Burns_, 624 F.2d 95 (10th Cir), _cert. denied_,

449 U.S. 954 (1980). 

 The third paragraph in the discussion is

based on paragraph 73 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on _

Military Judges Benchbook,_ DA Pam 27-9 Appendix A. (May 1982). _

See also_ _United States v. Thomas_, 11 M.J. 388 (C.M.A.1981); _

United States v. Fowler_, 9 M.J. 149 (C.M.A. 1980); _United

States v. James_, 5 M.J. 382 (C.M.A. 1978) (uncharged misconduct); _

United States v. Robinson_, 11 M.J. 218 (C.M.A. 1981) (character

evidence); _United States v. Wahnon_, 1 M.J. 144 (C.M.A. 1975)

(effect of guilty plea on other charges); _United States v. Minter

_, 8 M.J. 867 (N.C.M.R.), _ aff'd,_ 9 M.J. 397 (C.M.A.

1980); _United States v. Prowell_, 1 M.J. 612 (A.C.M.R. 1975)

(effect of accused's absence from trial); _United States v. Jackson

_, 6 M.J. 116 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Farrington_,

14 U.S.C.M.A. 614, 34 C.M.R. 394 (1964) (accused's failure to testify).

The list is not exhaustive. 

 The fourth paragraph in the discussion

is based on paragraph 73 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ _United States v. Grandy_, 11 M.J. 270 (C.M.A.

1981). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (e)(5)(D) was

amended to conform to amendments to R.C.M. 916(b). 

 _ 1998

Amendment:_ This change to R.C.M. 920(e) implemented Congress' creation

of a mistake of fact defense for carnal knowledge. Article 120(d), UCMJ,

provides that the accused must prove by a preponderance of the evidence

that the person with whom he or she had sexual intercourse was at least 12

years of age, and that the accused reasonably believed that this person was

at least 16 years of age.

 _2007 Amendment_:  Changes to this paragraph, deleting "carnal knowledge" and consistent language, are based on section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006, which supersedes the previous paragraph 45, Rape and Carnal Knowledge, in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct.

 _2015 Amendment_. Changes to this paragraph are based on section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011, which superseded the previous paragraph 45, "Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct," in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with "Rape and sexual assault generally." In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 added paragraph 45b, "Rape and sexual assault of a child," and paragraph 45c, "Other sexual misconduct."

### (f) Waiver.

This subsection is based on the last two sentences in Fed. R. Crim.

 P. 30. _See also_ _United States v. Grandy, supra;

United States v. Salley_, 9 M.J. 189 (C.M.A. 1980). 

## Rule 921. Deliberations and voting on findings

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 39(b) and on the second, third,

 and fifth sentences of paragraph 74 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The first sentence of that paragraph is unnecessary and the fourth is covered

in subsection (b) of this rule. 

### (b) Deliberations.

The first sentence of this subsection is based on the fourth sentence

 of paragraph 74 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence

is new but conforms to current practice. _See United States v.  Hurt

_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 735, 27 C.M.R. 3 (1958); _United States v.

 Christensen_, 30 C.M.R. 959 (A.F.B.R. 1961). The third sentence

is based on _United States v.  Jackson_, 6 M.J. 116, 117 (C.M.A.

 1979) (Cook, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); _United

 States v. Smith_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 416, 35 C.M.R. 388 (1965). _

See also_ paragraph 54 _ b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev); _

United States v. Ronder_, 639 F.2d 931 (2d Cir. 1981). 

### (c) Voting.

Subsection (1) is based on the first sentence of Article 51(a) and

on the first sentence of paragraph  73 _d_(2) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

 Subsection (2) is based on Article 52(a) and on the first

two sentences of paragraph 74 _d_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ _United States v. Guilford_, 8 M.J. 598

(A.C.M.R. 1979), _pet. denied_, 8 M.J. 242 (1980) (holding _

Burch v. Louisiana_, 441 U.S. 130 (1979), does not apply to courts-martial.)

The discussion is based on the third sentence of paragraph  74 _

d_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection (3) is based on

the fourth sentence of paragraph 74 _d_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsections (4) and (5) were redesignated as subsections

(5) and (6) and a new subsection (4) was inserted. New subsection (4) is

based on Article 50a(e) and provides for bifurcated voting on the elements

of the offense and on mental responsibility, and defines the procedures for

arriving at a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack on mental responsibility.

When the prosecution had the burden of proving mental responsibility beyond

a reasonable doubt, the same as the burden regarding the elements of the

offense, the members were unlikely to confuse the two general issues. Without

any procedure for bifurcated voting under the 1984 amendment, substantial

confusion might result if the members were required to vote simultaneously

on whether the defense has proven lack of mental responsibility by clear

and convincing evidence, and whether the prosecution has proven the elements

of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Each issue might result in a different

 number of votes. Bifurcated voting is also necessary to provide the finding

of "not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility"

 provided for in R.C.M. 918(a). _But see_ Carroll, _

 Insanity Defense Reform,_ 114 Mil. L. Rev. 183, 216 (1986). 

 Subsection

(4) is new to the Manual but it conforms to practice generally followed in

courts-martial. Paragraph 74 _d_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) suggested

that findings as to a specification and all lesser offenses included therein

would be resolved by a single ballot. Such an approach is awkward, however,

especially when there are multiple lesser included offenses. It is more appropriate

to allow separate consideration of each included offense until a finding

of guilty has been reached. _See_ _Military Judges Benchbook,

_ DA Pam 27-9, para. 2.28 (May 1982). 

 Subsection

(5) is based on the second sentence of Article 51(b) and on paragraph 74 _

d_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United

States v. Dilday_, 47 C.M.R. 172 (A.C.M.R. 1973). 

### (d) Action after findings are reached.

This subsection and the discussion are based on paragraphs 74 _

 f_(1) and 74 _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See

United States v. Justice_, 3 M.J. 451 (C.M.A. 1977); _United

States v. Ricketts_, 1 M.J. 78 (C.M.A. 1975); _ United States

v. McAllister_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 420, 42 C.M.R. 22 (1970). The use

of findings worksheets is encouraged. _See United States v. Henderson

_, 11 M.J. 395 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v.  Barclay_,

6 M.J. 785 (A.C.M.R. 1978), _pet. denied,_ 7 M.J. 71 (1979). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ The word "sentence" was changed to "findings"

 to correct an error in MCM, 1984. 

## Rule 922. Announcement of findings

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 53 and on the first sentence

of paragraph 74 _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ _United States v. Dilday_, 47 C.M.R. 172 (A.C.M.R.

1973). The discussion is based on _United States v. Ricketts_,

1 M.J. 78 (C.M.A. 1975); _United States v. Stewart_, 48 C.M.R.

877 (A.C.M.R. 1974). The requirement for the announcement to include a statement

of the percentage of members concurring in each finding of guilty and that

the vote was by secret written ballot has been deleted. Article 53 does not

require such an announcement and when instructions on such matters are given

(_see_ R.C.M. 920(e)(6)), the members are "presumed

to have complied with the instructions given them by the judge," _

United States v. Ricketts_, _supra_ at 82. _

See United States v. Jenkins_, 12 M.J. 222 (C.M.A. 1982). _

Cf._ _United States v. Hendon_, 6 M.J. 171, 173-174

(C.M.A. 1979). 

### (b) Findings by members.

This subsection is based on the second sentence of paragraph 74

 _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The last sentence is based on the

last sentence of paragraph 70 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ R.C.M. 922(b) was amended by adding a new paragraph

(2) as a conforming change to the amendment in R.C.M. 1004(a) making unanimity

on findings a precondition to a capital sentencing proceeding. The Rule

and the Discussion also preclude use of the reconsideration procedure in

R.C.M. 924 to change a nonunanimous finding of guilty to a unanimous verdict

for purposes of authorizing a capital sentencing proceeding. Thus, if a

nonunanimous finding of guilty is reaffirmed on reconsideration and the vote

happens to be unanimous, the president of the court-martial does not make

a statement as to unanimity. 

### (c) Findings by military judge.

This subsection is based on the second sentence of the last paragraph

 of paragraph 70 _b_ and on the second paragraph of paragraph

74 _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) _See also_ Article

 39(a). 

### (d) Erroneous announcement.

This subsection is based on the third and fourth sentences of paragraph

74 _g_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (e) Polling prohibited.

This subsection is based on the requirement in Article 51(a) for

 voting by secret written ballot. This distinguishes military from civilian

practice (_see_, Fed. R. Crim. P. 31(d)). Mil. R. Evid. 606(b)

 permits adequately broad questioning to ascertain whether a finding is subject

 to impeachment due to extraneous factors. To permit general inquiry into

other matters, including actual votes of members, would be contrary to

Article 51(a) and Article 39(b). _See United States v.  Bishop_,

11 M.J. 7 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. West_, 23 U.S.C.M.A.

77, 48 C.M.R. 548 (1974) (Duncan, C.J.); _United States v. Nash_,

5 U.S.C.M.A. 550, 555, 18 C.M.R. 174, 179 (1955) (Brosman, J. concurring); _

United States v. Connors_, 23 C.M.R. 636 (A.B.R. 1957); _

United States v. Tolbert_, 14 C.M.R. 613 (A.F.B.R. 1953). _

Advocate 53 (Mar- Apr, 1979); Feld, _A Manual for Courts-Martial

Practice and Appeal_ &sect; 72 (1957). _See also_ _

United States v. Hendon, supra._ 

## Rule 923. Impeachment of findings

 This rule is based on _United States v. Bishop_,

 11 M.J. 7 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. West_, 23 U.S.C.M.A.

77, 48 C.M.R. 548 (1974). _See also_ _United States

v. Witherspoon_, 12 M.J. 588 (A.C.M.R. 1981), _pet. granted

_, 13 M.J. 210 (C.M.A. 1982), _aff'd_ 16 M.J. 252

(1983); _United States v. Hance_, 10 M.J. 622 (A.C.M.R. 1980); _

United States v. Zinsmeister_, 48 C.M.R. 931, 935 (A.F.C.M.R.), _

pet. denied_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 620 (1974); _United States v.

Perez-Pagan_, 47 C.M.R. 719 (A.C.M.R. 1973); _United States

v. Connors_, 23 C.M.R. 636 (A.B.R. 1957); Mil. R. Evid. 606(b). 

 As

to inconsistent findings, _see Harris v. Rivera_ , 454 U.S.

339 (1981); _Dunn v. United States_, 284 U.S. 390 (1932); _

United States v. Gaeta_, 14 M.J. 383, 391 n. 10 (C.M.A. 1983); _

United States v. Ferguson_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 200, 44 C.M.R. 254 (1972); _

United States v. Jules_, 15 C.M.R. 517 (A.B.R. 1954). _But

see United States v. Reid_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 497, 31 C.M.R. 83 (1961); _

United States v. Butler_, 41 C.M.R. 620 (A.C.M.R. 1969). 

 The

rule is not intended to prevent a military judge from setting aside improper

findings. This would include improper findings of guilty of "mutually

exclusive" offenses, for example, larceny (as a perpetrator) of certain

property and receiving the same stolen property. In such a case, the members

should be instructed before they deliberate that they may convict of no more

than one of the two offenses. _See Milanovich v. United States_,

365 U.S. 551 (1961); _United States v. Cartwright_, 13 M.J.

174 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Clark_, U.S.C.M.A. 140,

42 C.M.R. 332  (1970); _United States v. Ford_, 12 U.S.C.M.A.

3, 30 C.M.R. 3 (1960). 

## Rule 924. Reconsideration of findings

### (a) Time for reconsideration.

This subsection is based on Article 52(c) and on the fourth and

fifth sentences of paragraph 74 _d_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

### (b) Procedure.

This subsection is based on Articles 52(a) and 53(c) and on the

last three sentences of paragraph 74 _d_(3) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). _See also_ _United States v. Boland_,

20 U.S.C.M.A. 83, 42 C.M.R. 275 (1970). 

 _1987 Amendment:

_ R.C.M. 924(b) was amended in conjunction with the adoption in R.C.M.

 921(c)(4) of bifurcated voting on lack of mental responsibility. It is also

 necessary to bifurcate the vote on reconsideration to retain the relative

burdens for reconsideration and to prevent prejudice to the accused. 

### (c) Military judge sitting alone.

This subsection is new to the Manual, although the power of the

 military judge to reconsider findings of guilty has been recognized. _

United States v. Chatman_, 49 C.M.R. 319 (N.C.M.R. 1974).  It is

also implicit in Article 16 which empowers the military judge sitting alone

to perform the functions of the members. _See_ Article 52(c). 

 _

1995 Amendment:_ The amendment limits reconsideration of findings

by the members to findings reached in closed session but not yet announced

in open court and provides for the military judge, in judge alone cases,

to reconsider the "guilty finding" of a not guilty only by reason

of lack of mental responsibility finding. 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER X. SENTENCING

## Rule 1001. Presentencing procedure

 _Introduction._ This rule is based on paragraph

 75 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Additions, deletions, or modifications, other than

format or style changes, are noted in specific subsections _infra

_. 

 Sentencing procedures in Federal civilian courts can

be followed in courts-martial only to a limited degree. Sentencing in courts-martial

may be by the military judge or members. _ See_ Article 16

and 52(b). The military does not have-and it is not feasible to create-an

 independent, judicially supervised probation service to prepare presentence

reports. _See_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c). This rule allows the

 presentation of much of the same information to the court-martial as would

be contained in a presentence report, but it does so within the protections

of an adversarial proceeding, to which rules of evidence apply (_

but cf. Williams v. New York_, 337 U.S. 241 (1949)), although they

may be relaxed for some purposes. _See_ subsections (b)(4)

and (5), (c)(3), (d), and (e) of this rule. The presentation of matters in

 the accused's service records (_see_ subsection (b)(2) of

this  rule) provides much of the information which would be in a presentence

report. Such records are not prepared for purposes of prosecution (_

cf._ _United States v. Boles_, 11 M.J. 195 (C.M.A.

1981)) and are therefore impartial, like presentence reports. In addition,

the clarification of the types of cases in which aggravation evidence may

be introduced (_see_ subsection (b)(4) of this rule) and

authorization for the trial counsel to present opinion evidence about the

accused's rehabilitative potential (_see_ subsection (b)(5)

of this rule) provide additional avenues for presenting relevant information

to the court-martial. The accused retains the right to present matters in

extenuation and mitigation (_see_ subsection (c) of this rule). 

 In

addition to Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c), several other subsections in Fed. R.

Crim. P. 32 are inapplicable to courts-martial or are covered in other rules.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(a)(2) is covered in R.C.M. 1010. Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(1)

is inapposite; parallel matters are covered in R.C.M. 1114.  Fed. R. Crim.

P. 32(b)(2) is inapplicable as courts-martial lack power to adjudge criminal

forfeiture of property. Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(d) is covered in R.C.M. 910(h). _

See also_ Article 45(a). As to Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e), _

see_ R.C.M. 1108. 

### (a) In general.

Subsection (a)(3) is based on the third sentence of paragraph 53

 _h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on the second sentence of Fed.

R. Crim. P. 32(a). _See also__Hill v. United States

_, 368 U.S. 424 (1962); _Green v. United States_,

365 U.S. 301 (1961). Subsection (a)(3) of paragraph 75 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

is deleted as the convening authority is no longer required to examine the

findings for factual sufficiency. Subsection (a)(2) is consistent with the

first sentence of Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(a). _See_ Article

53. As to the last sentence of Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(a), _ see_ subsection

(g) of this rule.

 _2015 Amendment_: R.C.M. 1001(a)(1) was revised to implement Article 6b(a)(4)(B), UCMJ, as created by Section 1701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113 66, 26 December 2013.

### (b) Matter to be presented by the prosecution.

Subsections (3) and (4) are modifications of paragraph 75 _

 b_(3) and (4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), and subsection (5) is new. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ The word "age" in subsection (1) was

deleted to correct error in MCM, 1984. 

 The fourth sentence of

subsection (2) is modified by substituting "a particular document"

 for "the information." This is intended to avoid the result

reached in _United States v. Morgan_, 15 M.J. 128 (C.M.A.

1983). For reasons discussed above, sentencing proceedings in courts-martial

are adversarial. Within the limits prescribed in the Manual, each side should

have the opportunity to present, or not present, evidence. _Morgan

_ encourages gamesmanship and may result in less information being

 presented in some case because of the lack of opportunity to rebut. 

 _

1987 Amendment:_ The words "all those records" were changed

to "any records" to implement more clearly the drafters' original

intent. According to the paragraph just above, the drafters "intended

to avoid the result reached in _United States v. Morgan_," _

supra,_ by allowing the trial counsel to offer only such records

as he or she desired to offer. In _Morgan_, the court held

that, when the trial counsel offered adverse documents from the accused's

 service record, the "rule of completeness" under Mil. R. Evid.

106 required that all documents from that record be offered. 

 Subsection

(3) deletes the exclusion of convictions more than 6 years old. No similar

restriction applies to consideration of prior convictions at sentencing proceedings

in Federal civilian courts. There is no reason to forbid their consideration

by courts-martial, subject to Mil. R. Evid. 403. 

 Subsection (3)

also eliminates the requirement that a conviction be final before it may

be considered by the court-martial on sentencing. No similar restriction

applies in Federal civilian courts. This subsection parallels Mil. R. Evid.

609. An exception is provided for summary courts-martial and special courts-martial

 without a military judge. _See_ Analysis, Mil. R. Evid. 609.

 Whether the adjudication of guilt in a civilian forum is a conviction will

depend on the law in that jurisdiction. 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ The reference to "Article 65(c)" was changed to "Article

 64" to correct an error in MCM, 1984. 

 _2002 Amendment:

_ As previously written, R.C.M. 1001(b)(3)(A) offered little guidance

about what it meant by "civilian convictions." _See, e.g.,

United States v. White_, 47 M.J. 139, 140 (C.A.A.F. 1997); _

United States v. Barnes_, 33 M.J. 468, 472-73 (C.M.A. 1992); _

United States v. Slovacek_, 24 M.J. 140, 141 (CMA), _cert.

denied_, 484 U.S. 855 (1987). The present rule addresses this void

and intends to give the sentencing authority as much information as the military

judge determines is relevant in order to craft an appropriate sentence for

the accused. 

 Unlike most civilian courts, this rule does not allow

admission of more extensive criminal history information, such as arrests.

Use of such additional information is not appropriate in the military setting

where court-martial members, not a military judge, often decide the sentence.

Such information risks unnecessarily confusing the members. 

 The

present rule clarifies the term "conviction" in light of the

complex and varying ways civilian jurisdictions treat the subject. The military

judge may admit relevant evidence of civilian convictions without necessarily

being bound by the action, procedure, or nomenclature of civilian jurisdictions.

Examples of judicial determinations admissible as convictions under this

rule include accepted pleas of _nolo contendere_, pleas accepted

under _North Carolina v. Alford_, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), or deferred

 sentences. If relevant, evidence of forfeiture of bail that results in a

judicial determination of guilt is also admissible, as recognized in _

United States v. Eady_, 35 M.J. 15, 16 (C.M.A. 1992). While no time

limit is placed upon the admissibility of prior convictions, the military

judge should conduct a balancing test to determine whether convictions older

than ten years should be admitted or excluded on the basis of relevance and

fundamental fairness. 

 The two central factors in this rule are

(1) judicial determination of guilt and (2) assumption of guilt. Assumption

of guilt is an all-inclusive term meaning any act by the accused in a judicial

proceeding accepting, acknowledging, or admitting guilt. As long as either

factor is present, the "conviction" is admissible, if relevant.

Consequently, this rule departs from the holding in _United States

v. Hughes_, 26 M.J. 119, 120 (C.M.A. 1988), where the accused pleaded

guilty in a Texas court, but the judge did not enter a finding of guilty

under state law allowing "deferred adjudications." Under the

present rule, the "conviction" would be admissible because the

accused pleaded guilty in a judicial proceeding, notwithstanding the fact

that the state judge did not enter a finding of guilty. 

 In contrast,

"deferred prosecutions," where there is neither an admission

of guilt in a judicial proceeding nor a finding of guilty, would be excluded.

 The rule also excludes expunged convictions, juvenile adjudications, minor

traffic violations, foreign convictions, and tribal court convictions as

matters inappropriate for or unnecessarily confusing to courts-martial members.

What constitutes a 'minor traffic violation' within the meaning

of this rule is to be decided with reference only to federal law, and not

to the laws of individual states. See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual Sec.

4A1.2(c)(2); "What Constitutes 'Minor Traffic Infraction'

Excludable From Calculation of Defendant's Criminal History under United

States Sentencing Guideline Sec.  4A1.2(c)(2)," 113 A.L.R. Fed. 561

(1993). 

 Additionally, because of the lack of clarity in the previous

rule, courts sometimes turned to Mil. R. Evid. 609 for guidance. _

See, e.g., Slovacek_, 24 M.J. at 141. We note that because the policies

behind Mil. R. Evid. 609 and the present rule differ greatly, a conviction

that may not be appropriate for impeachment purposes under Mil. R. Evid.

609, may nevertheless be admissible under the present rule. 

 The

Federal Sentencing Guidelines were consulted when drafting the present rule.

Although informed by those guidelines, the present rule departs from them

in many respects because of the wide differences between the courts-martial

process and practice in federal district court. 

 Subsection (4)

makes clear that evidence in aggravation may be introduced whether the accused

pleaded guilty or not guilty, and whether or not it would be admissible on

the merits. This is consistent with the interpretation of paragraph 75 _

b_(3) (later amended to be paragraph 75 _b_(4) of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) by Exec. Order No. 12315 (July 29, 1981)) in _United

States v.  Vickers_, 13 M.J. 403 (C.M.A. 1982). _See also

_ U.S. Dep't of Justice, Attorney General's Task Force on Violent

Crime, Final Report Recommendation 14 (1981); Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(2)(B)

and (C). This subsection does not authorize introduction in general of evidence

of bad character or uncharged misconduct. The evidence must be of circumstances

directly relating to or resulting from an offense of which the accused has

been found guilty. _See United States v. Rose_, 6 M.J. 754

(N.C.M.R. 1978), _pet. denied_, 7 M.J. 56 (C.M.A. 1979); _

United States v. Taliaferro_, 2 M.J. 397 (A.C.M.R. 1975); _

United States v. Peace_, 49 C.M.R. 172 (A.C.M.R. 1974). 

 _

1999 Amendment:_ R.C.M. 1001(b)(4) was amended by elevating to the

Rule language that heretofore appeared in the Discussion to the Rule. The

Rule was further amended to recognize that evidence that the offense was

a _hate crime_ may also be presented to the sentencing authority.

The additional _hate crime_ language was derived in part from

section 3A1.1 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, in which hate crime

motivation results in an upward adjustment in the level of the offense for

 which the defendant is sentenced. Courts-martial sentences are not awarded

upon the basis of guidelines, such as the Federal Sentencing Guidelines,

but rather upon broad considerations of the needs of the service and the

accused and on the premise that each sentence is individually tailored to

the offender and offense. The upward adjustment used in the Federal Sentencing

Guidelines does not directly translate to the court-martial presentencing

procedure. Therefore, in order to adapt this concept to the court-martial

process, this amendment was made to recognize that "hate crime" motivation

is admissible in the court-martial presentencing procedure. This amendment

also differs from the Federal Sentencing Guideline in that the amendment

does not specify the burden of proof required regarding evidence of "hate

crime" motivation. No burden of proof is customarily specified regarding

aggravating evidence admitted in the presentencing procedure, with the notable

exception of aggravating factors under R.C.M. 1004 in capital cases. 

 _

Subsection (5) is new._ (Paragraph 75b(5) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) is

deleted here, as it is now covered in R.C.M. 701(a)(5). _ Cf._ Fed.

R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3).) Subsection (5) authorizes the trial counsel to present,

in the form of opinion testimony (_see_ Mil. R. Evid., Section

VII), evidence of the accused's character as a servicemember and rehabilitative

potential. Note that inquiry into specific instances of conduct is not permitted

on direct examination, but may be made on cross-examination. Subsection (5)

will allow a more complete presentation of information about the accused

to the court-martial. The accused's character is in issue as part of the

sentencing decision, since the sentence must be tailored to the offender. _

Cf._ _United States v. Lania_, 9 M.J. 100 (C.M.A. 1980).

Therefore, introduction of evidence of this nature should not be contingent

solely upon the election of the defense. Information of a similar nature,

from the accused's employer or neighbors, is often included in civilian

presentencing reports. _See, e.g.,_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(2).

Subsection (5) guards against unreliable information by guaranteeing that

the accused will have the right to confront and cross-examine such witnesses. 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ The amendment is based on decisional law interpreting

subsection (b)(5), including _United States v. Pompey_, 33

M.J. 266 (C.M.A. 1991), _United States v. Claxton_, 32 M.J.

159 (C.M.A. 1991), _United States v. Aurich_, 31 M.J. 95 (C.M.A.

1990), _United States v. Ohrt_, 28 M.J. 301 (C.M.A. 1989),

and _United States v. Horner_, 22 M.J. 294 (C.M.A. 1986).

### (e) Production of witnesses.

The language of subsection (2)(C) has been modified to clarify that

 only a stipulation of fact permits nonproduction. _See United States

v. Gonzalez_, 16 M.J. 58 (C.M.A. 1983).

 _2007 Amendment_:  Subsection (e)(2)(D) was amended to allow the availability of various types of remote testimony to be a factor to consider in whether a pre-sentencing witness must be physically produced.

### (f) Additional matters to be considered.

This subsection is based on the third and fourth sentences of paragraph

76 _a_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on the first sentence of

paragraph 123 of MCM 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on the last two

sentences of paragraph 123 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (g) Argument.

The last paragraph is new. _See Analysis_, R.C.M.

 919(c). As to the second sentence, _see United States v. Grady_,

 15 M.J. 275 (C.M.A. 1983). 

## Rule 1001A. Crime victims and presentencing

 _2015 Amendment_: R.C.M. 1001A was added to implement Article 6b(a)(4)(B), UCMJ, as created by Section 1701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, concerning the right of a victim to be reasonably heard at a sentencing hearing relating to the offense. It is consistent with the principles of law and federal practice prescribed in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3771(a)(4) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(B), which requires the court to "address any victim of the crime who is present at sentencing" and "permit the victim to be reasonably heard." _See_ 10 U.S.C. &sect; 836(a). Additionally, the June 2014 report of the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel (RSP) recommended that the President prescribe appropriate regulations to provide victims the right to make an unsworn victim impact statement, not subject to cross examination, during the presentencing proceeding. The RSP was a congressionally mandated panel tasked to conduct an independent review and assessment of the systems used to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate crimes involving adult sexual assault and related offenses.

## Rule 1002. Sentence determination

 This rule is based on the first sentence in paragraph 76 _

a_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 1003. Punishments

 _Introduction._ This rule lists the punishments

 a court-martial is authorized to impose, and presents general limitations

on punishments not provided in specific rules elsewhere. Limitations based

on jurisdiction (_see_ R.C.M. 201(f)); rehearings, other

and new trials (_see_ R.C.M. 810(d)); and on referral instructions

(_see_ R.C.M. 601(e)(1)) are contained elsewhere, but are

referred to this rule. _See_ subsection (c)(3) and discussion.

 The maximum punishments for each offense are listed in Part IV. The automatic

suspension of limitations at paragraph of paragraph 127 _c_(5)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) is deleted since the maximum punishments now include

appropriate adjustments in the maximum authorized punishment in time of war

or under other circumstances. 

### (a) In general.

This subsection provides express authority for adjudging any authorized

punishment in the case of any person tried by court-martial, subject only

to specific limitations prescribed elsewhere. It does not change current

law. 

### (b) Authorized punishments.

This subsection lists those punishments which are authorized, rather

 than some which are prohibited. This approach is simpler and should eliminate

 questions about what punishments a court-martial may adjudge. 

 Subsection

(1) is based on paragraph 126 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Admonition

has been deleted as unnecessary. 

 Subsection (2) is based on paragraphs

126 _h_(1) and (2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

1990 Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(2) was amended to incorporate the

statutory expansion of jurisdiction over inactive-duty reserve component

personnel provided in the Military Justice Amendments of 1986, tit. VIII,

&sect; 804, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub.

 L. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986). 

 _1994 Amendment:_ The

references to "retired" and "retainer" pay was added

to make clear that those forms of pay are subject to computation of forfeiture

in the same way as basic pay. Articles 17, 18, and 19, UCMJ, do not distinguish

between these types of pay. Sentences including forfeiture of these types

of pay were affirmed in _United States v. Hooper_, 9 U.S.C.M.A.

637, 26 C.M.R. 417 (1958) (retired pay), and_ United States v. Overton

_, 24 M.J. 309 (C.M.A. 1987) (retainer pay).

 _2005 Amendment_:  Hardship Duty Pay (HDP) superseded Foreign Duty Pay (FDP) on 3 February 1999.  HDP is payable to members entitled to basic pay.  The Secretary of Defense has established that HDP will be paid to members (a) for performing specific missions, or (b) when assigned to designated areas.

 Subsection (3) is based on paragraph 126 _h_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(3) and Analysis concerning possible issues raised

by enforcing a fine through confinement. 

 Detention of pay (paragraph

126 _h_(4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)) has been deleted. This punishment

has been used very seldom and is administratively cumbersome.

 _2002 Amendment:_ The amendment clearly defines the authority of special

and summary courts-martial to adjudge both fines and forfeitures. _

See generally United States v. Tualla_, 52 M.J. 228 (2000).

 _2010 Amendment_. Subsection (b)(3) was amended to distinguish the maximum amount that can be fined for persons serving with or accompanying the armed forces from that which can be lawfully fined for active duty personnel.

 Subsection (4) is based on paragraph 126 _i_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 Subsection (5) is based on the second paragraph of paragraph 126 _e_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The first sentence in the discussion is based on the same

paragraph. The second sentence in the discussion is based on the last sentence

in the first paragraph of paragraph 126 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(6) is based on paragraph 126 _g_ and on the ninth sentence

of the second paragraph 127 _c_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

 equivalency of restriction and confinement has been incorporated here and

is based on the table of equivalencies at paragraph 127 _c_ (2)

of MCM, 1969 (rev.). _See also_ Article 20. 

 Subsection

(7) and the discussion are based on paragraph 126 _k_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The last sentence in the rule is new and is based on the

table of equivalent punishments at paragraph 127 _ c_(2) of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) _See also_ Article 20. 

 _

2002 Amendment:_ This change resulted from the enactment of Article

56a, UCMJ, in section 581 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

Year 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-85, 111 Stat. 1629, 1759 (1997).

 Subsection (8) is based on paragraph 126 _j_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Matters

in the second paragraph of paragraph 126 _ j_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.) are now covered in R.C.M. 1113(e)(2)(A).

 Subsection (9)

is based on the last paragraph of paragraph 125 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

last sentence is new and is based on the table of equivalent punishments

at paragraph 127 _c_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(10)(A) is based on the second paragraph of paragraph 126 _d_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsections (10)(B) and (C) are based on paragraphs 76 _

a_(3) and (4) and 127 _c_ (4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Under R.C.M. 1003(c)(2)(A)(iv), a warrant officer

who is not commissioned can be punished by a dishonorable discharge when

convicted at general court-martial of any offense. This continued the rule

of paragraph 126 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence

of subsection (10)(B), added in 1985, does not make any substantive change,

but merely restates the provision in subsection (10)(B) to maintain the parallelism

with subsection (10)(A), which governs dismissal of commissioned officers,

commissioned warrant officers, cadets, and midshipmen. 

 As to subsection

(11), _see_ R.C.M. 1004. 

 Subsection (12) is based

on Article 18. 

 Subsections (6), (7), and (9) incorporate equivalencies

for restriction, hard labor without confinement, confinement, and confinement

on bread and water or diminished rations. This makes the table of equivalent

 punishments at paragraph 127 _c_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) unnecessary

and it had been deleted. That table was confusing and subject to different

interpretations. For example, the table and the accompanying discussion suggested

that if the maximum punishment for an offense was confinement for 3 months

and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month, for 3 months, a court-martial

could elect to adjudge confinement for 6 months and no forfeitures. The deletion

of the table and inclusion of specific equivalencies where they apply eliminates

the possibility of such a result. 

 _1999 Amendment:_

Loss of numbers, lineal position, or seniority has been deleted. Although

loss of numbers had the effect of lowering precedence for some purposes, _

e.g._, quarters priority, board and court seniority, and actual

date of promotion, loss of numbers did not affect the officer's original

position for purposes of consideration for retention or promotion. Accordingly,

this punishment was  deleted because of its negligible consequences and the

misconception that it was a meaningful punishment. 

### (c) Limits on punishments.

Subsections (1)(A) and (B) are based on paragraph 127 _ c

_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (1)(C) is based on the first

3 sentences and the last sentence of paragraph 76 _a_(5) of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See Blockburger v. United States_, 284

U.S. 299 (1932); _ United States v. Washington_, 1 M.J. 473

(C.M.A. 1976). _See also_ _Missouri v. Hunter_,

459 U.S. 359 (1983); _United States v. Baker_, 14 M.J. 361

(C.M.A. 1983). The discussion prior to 2012 was based on paragraph 76 _a_(5)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See_ 2012 Amendment below. The third and fourth paragraphs of the pre-2012 Discussion addressed tests for determining separate offenses and referred to the following cases: _United States v. Stegall_, 6 M.J. 176 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Harrison_, 4 M.J. 332 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Irving_, 3 M.J. 6 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Hughes_, 1 M.J. 346 (C.M.A. 1976); _United  States v. Burney_, 44 C.M.R. 125 (1971); _United States v. Posnick_, 24 C.M.R. 11 (1957). See MCM (2008 Edition) for pre-2012 Discussion.

_ 2015 Amendment_. This rule was amended because the language in previous editions of the Manual seemed to suggest that an accused could not be punished for offenses that were not separate. This is true only if there is no express statement from Congress indicating that an accused can be punished for two or more offenses that are not separate. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3) and related analysis. Subsections (i) and (ii) were added to distinguish between claims of multiplicity and unreasonable multiplication of charges. As the two concepts are distinct, it is important to address them in separate subsections. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12) for claims of unreasonable multiplication of charges and R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B) for claims of multiplicity.

 Additionally, the committee decided to move the discussion of the factors in _United States v. Quiroz_, 55 M.J. 334 (C.A.A.F. 2001), from this rule to R.C.M. 906(b)(12) because the factors apply to unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings as well as sentence. Because this Rule refers only to sentencing, it is more appropriate to address the military judge's determination of unreasonable multiplication in R.C.M. 906(b)(12), because that Rule covers both findings and sentence. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12) and related analysis.

 The language in the discussion section of the 2012 edition of the Manual referring to the Campbell decision was removed because it is no longer necessary, as the Rules themselves have been edited to remove any reference to "multiplicious for sentencing" and the discussion section of R.C.M. 906(b)(12) addresses the _Quiroz_ factors.

 Subsection (2)(A) is based on paragraph 126 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Paragraph

127 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) provided that the maximum punishments

 were "not binding" in cases of officers, but could "be

used as a guide." Read in conjunction with paragraph 126 _

d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) these provisions had the practical effect

of prescribing no limits on forfeitures when the accused is an officer. This

distinction has now been deleted. The maximum limits on forfeitures are the

same for officers and enlisted persons. 

 Subsection (3) is based

on paragraph 127 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It serves as a

reminder that the limits on punishments may be affected by other rules, which

are referred to in the discussion. 

 The last sentence in subsections

(1) and (2) is new. Under R.C.M. 1001(b)(3), a court-martial conviction may

now be considered by the sentencing body whether or not it is final. Allowing

such a conviction to affect the maximum punishment may cause later problems,

however. The subsequent reversal of a conviction would seldom affect a sentence

of another court-martial where that conviction was merely a factor which

was considered, especially when the pendency of an appeal may also have been

considered. However, reversal would always affect the validity of any later

discharge or confinement for which it provided the basis. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (c)(3) was redesignated as subsection

(c)(4) and new subsection (c)(3) was added to reflect the legislative restrictions

placed upon punishment of reserve component personnel in certain circumstances

in the amendment to Article 2, UCMJ, contained in the "Military Justice

Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII, &sect; 804, National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub.L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986).

 Subsection (4) was created in 2010 and caused former subparagraph (4) to be renumbered as "(5) Based on other rules."

 _2010 Amendment_. New subsection (4) limits the type of punishments a person serving with or accompanying the armed forces may receive.

### (d) Circumstances permitting increased punishments.

This subsection is based on Section B of the Table of Maximum Punishments,

paragraph 127 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _

United States v. Timmons_, 13 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982). The last two

sentences in the discussion are based on _United States v.  Mack_,

9 M.J. 300 (C.M.A. 1980); _United States v. Booker_, 5 M.J.

 238 (C.M.A. 1977), _ vacated in part,_ 5 M.J. 246 (C.M.A.

1978). _Cf._ _United States v. Cofield_, 11

M.J. 422 (C.M.A. 1981). 

 _1995 Amendment:_ Punishment

of confinement on bread and water or diminished rations (R.C.M. 1003(d)(9)),

as a punishment imposable by a court-martial, was deleted. Confinement on

bread and water or diminished rations was originally intended as an immediate,

remedial punishment. While this is still the case with nonjudicial punishment

(Article 15), it is not effective as a court-martial punishment. Subsections

(d)(10) through (d)(12) were redesignated (d)(9) through (d)(11), respectively.

## Rule 1004. Capital cases

 _Introduction._ This rule is new. It provides

 additional standards and procedures governing determination of a sentence

in capital cases. It is based on the President's authority under Articles

18, 36, and 56. _See also_ U.S. Const. Art. II, sec. 2, cl.

1. 

 This rule and the analysis were drafted before the Court of

 Military Appeals issued its decision in _United States v. Matthews

_, 16 M.J. 354 (C.M.A. 1983) on October 11, 1983. There the court

reversed the sentence of death because of the absence of a requirement for

the members to specifically find aggravating circumstances on which the sentence

was based. When this rule was drafted, the procedures for capital cases were

the subject of litigation in _ Matthews_ and other cases. _

See e.g., United States v. Matthews_, 13 M.J. 501 (A.C.M.R. 1982), _

rev'd, United States v.  Matthews, supra; United States v. Rojas_,

15 M.J. 902 (N.M.C.M.R.  1983). _See also United States v. Gay_,

16 M.J. 586 (A.F.C.M.R. 1982),_a'ffd_ 18 M.J. 104 (1984) (decided

after draft MCM was circulated for comment). The rule was drafted in recognition

that, as a matter of policy, procedures for the sentence determination in

capital cases should be revised, regardless of the outcome of such litigation,

 in order to better protect the rights of servicemembers. 

 While

the draft Manual was under review following public comment on it (_

see_ 48 Fed. Reg. 23688 (1983)), the _ Matthews_ decision

was issued. The holding in _Matthews_ generated a necessity

to revise procedures in capital cases. However, _ Matthews_ did

not require substantive revision of the proposed R.C.M. 1004. The several

modifications made in the rule since it was circulated for comment were based

on suggestions from other sources. They are unrelated to any of the issues

involved in_ Matthews_. 

 Capital punishment is

not unconstitutional _per se. Gregg v. Georgia_, 428 U.S.

153 (1976); _United States v. Matthews, supra._ Capital punishment

does not violate Article 55. _Compare_ Article 55 with Articles

85, 90, 94, 99-102, 104, 106, 110, 113, 118, and 120. _See United

States v. Matthews, supra._ But_ cf. Id._ at 382

(Fletcher, J., concurring in result) (absent additional  procedural requirements,

sentence of death violated Article 55). The Supreme Court has established

that capital punishment does not violate the Eighth Amendment (U.S. Const.

amend. VIII) unless it: "makes no measurable contribution to acceptable

goals of punishment and hence is nothing more than a purposeless and needless

imposition of pain and suffering"; "is grossly out of proportion

to the crime" (_Coker v. Georgia,_ 433 U.S. 584, 592

(1977)); or is adjudged under procedures which do not adequately protect

against the arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion in determining

a sentence. _Furman v. Georgia_, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). _

Cf._ _Barclay v. Florida_, 463 U.S. 939 (1983); _

Zant v. Stephens,_ 462 U.S. 862 (1983); _Godfrey v. Georgia,

_ 446 U.S. 420 (1980); _Jurek v. Texas,_ 428 U.S.

262 (1976); _Proffitt v. Florida_, 428 U.S. 242 (1976); _

Gregg v. Georgia, supra. See United States v. Matthews, supra._

Furthermore, while the procedures under which death may be adjudged must

 adequately protect against the unrestrained exercise of discretion, they

may not completely foreclose discretion (at least in most cases, _

 see_ subsection (e), _infra_) or the consideration

of extenuating or mitigating circumstances. _See Eddings v. Oklahoma

_, 455 U.S. 104 (1982); _Lockett v. Ohio_, 438 U.S.

586 (1978); _Roberts (Harry) v. Louisiana_, 431 U.S. 633

(1977); _Roberts (Stanislaus) v. Louisiana_, 428 U.S. 325

(1976); _Woodson v. North Carolina_, 428 U.S. 280 (1976).

 In _Matthews_ the Court of Military Appeals suggested that

similar considerations apply with respect to Article 55's prohibitions against

cruel and unusual punishment. _United States v. Matthews, supra_ at

368-69, 379-80. 

 The Court of Military Appeals listed

several requirements for adjudication of the death penalty, based on Supreme

Court decisions: (1) a separate sentencing procedure must follow the finding

of guilt of a potential capital offense; (2) specific aggravating circumstances

must be identified to the sentencing authority; (3) the sentencing authority

must select and make findings on the particular aggravating circumstances

used as a basis for imposing the death sentence; (4) the defendant must have

an unrestricted opportunity to present mitigating and extenuating evidence;

and (5) mandatory appellate review must be required to consider the propriety

of the sentence as to the individual offense and individual defendant and

to compare the sentence to similar cases within the jurisdiction. _

See United States v.  Matthews, supra_ at 369-77 and cases

cited therein. 

 The Supreme Court has not decided whether_

Furman v. Georgia, supra,_ and subsequent decisions concerning capital

punishment apply to courts-martial. _See Schick v. Reed_,

419 U.S. 256 (1974). _But see Furman v. Georgia, supra_ at

412 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); _id._ at 417-18 (Powell,

J., dissenting). _See generally_ Pfau and Milhizer, _

The Military Death Penalty and the Constitution: There is Life After Furman,

_ 97 Mil.L.Rev. 35 (1982); Pavlick, _The Constitutionality

of the UCMJ Death Penalty Provisions,_ 97 Mil.L.Rev. 81 (1982); Comment, _

The Death Penalty in Military Courts: Constitutionally Imposed?_ 30

UCLA L. Rev. 366 (1982); Dawson, _Is the Death Penalty in the Military

Cruel and Unusual?_ 31 JAG J. (Navy) 53 (1980); English, _

The Constitutionality of the Court-Martial Death Sentence,_ 21 A.F.L.

Rev. 552 (1979). 

 The Court of Military Appeals held in _

United States v. Matthews, supra_, that the requirements established

by the Supreme Court for civilian cases apply in courts-martial, at least

in the absence of circumstances calling for different rules, such as combat

conditions or wartime spying. _United States v. Matthews, supra_ at

368. The court added that current military capital sentencing procedures

are constitutionally adequate in the following respects: (1) there is a separate

sentencing process in which the members are instructed by the military judge

as to their duties; (2) certain aggravating factors (_e.g.,_ premeditation)

must be found by the members during findings, and evidence of other aggravating

 circumstances may be submitted during sentencing; (3) the accused has an

 unlimited opportunity to present relevant evidence in extenuation and mitigation;

and (4) mandatory review is required by a Court of Military Review, and the

Court of Military Appeals, with further consideration by the President. _

United States v. Matthews, supra_ at 377-78. The court held

that the procedure is defective, however, in that the members are not required

to "specifically identify the aggravating factors upon which  they

have relied in choosing to impose the death penalty," _ id._ at

379, at least with respect to a peacetime murder case. _See id._ at

368. 

 The Court of Military Appeals stated in_Matthews_

that constitutionally adequate procedures for capital cases may be promulgated

by the President. _Id._ at 380-81. The President's unique

authority over military justice, particularly its procedure and punishments

is well established. _ See_ U.S. Const. Art. II, &sect; 2,

cl. 1; Articles 18, 36, and 56. Congress recently reaffirmed the broad scope

of this Presidential authority. _See_ Pub.L. No. 96-107, Title

VIII, &sect; 801(b), 93 Stat. 811 (Nov. 9, 1979); S.Rep. No. 107, 96th Cong.,

1st Sess. 123-125 (1979); _Hearings on S.428 Before the Military

Personnel Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services,_ 96th Cong.,

 1st Sess. 5-6, 14, 17-18, 20-21, 52, 106 (1979). _

See also_ _United States v. Ezell_, 6 M.J. 307, 316-17

(C.M.A. 1978); W. Winthrop, _Military Law and Precedents_ 27-33

(2d ed. 1920 reprint). _Cf._ _Jurek v. Texas, supra

_ (judicial construction may save an otherwise defective death penalty

provision). The changes made in this rule are procedural. _See Dobbert

v. Florida_, 432 U.S. 282 (1977). 

 R.C.M. 1004 is based

on the recognition that, in courts-martial, as in civilian prosecution,

death should be adjudged only under carefully tailored procedures designed

to ensure that all relevant matters are thoroughly considered and that such

punishment is appropriate. 

 At the same time, R.C.M. 1004 rests

on the conclusion that the death penalty remains a necessary sanction in

courts-martial and that it is an appropriate punishment under a broader range

of circumstances than may be the case in civilian jurisdictions. This is

because of the unique purpose and organization of the military, and its composition

and the circumstances in which it operates. _Cf._ _

Parker v. Levy_, 417 U.S. 733 (1974). _See also_ _

United States v. Matthews, supra_ at 368. 

 _1986

Amendment:_ The Rule was amended to substitute the word "factor"

for the word "circumstance" with respect to the aggravating factors

under R.C.M. 1004(c). This will more clearly distinguish such factors from

the aggravating circumstances applicable to any sentencing proceeding under

R.C.M. 1001(b)(4), which may be considered in the balancing process in capital

cases under R.C.M. 1004(b)(4)(B). 

### (a) In general.

Subsection (1) is based on the code and reflects the first of two

 "thresholds" before death may be adjudged; the accused must

have been found guilty of an offense for which death is authorized. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (2), referred to below in the original

Analysis, was redesignated as subsection (3), and a new subsection (2) was

added. The new subsection requires a unanimous verdict on findings before

the death penalty may be considered. Nothing in this provision changes existing

law under which a finding of guilty may be based upon a vote of two-thirds

of the members, and a finding based upon a two-thirds vote will continue

to provide the basis for sentencing proceedings in which any sentence other

than death may be imposed. This is an exercise of the President's powers

as commander-in-chief, and is not intended to cast doubt upon the validity

of the sentence in any capital case tried before the effective date of the

 amendments. 

 Subsection (2) refers to the remaining tests in subsections

(b) and (c) of the rule; the prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable

doubt, the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances listed in subsection

(c) of the rule. Only if this second threshold is passed may the members

consider death. If the members reach this point, their sentencing deliberations

and procedures would be like those in any other case, except that the members

must apply an additional specific standard before they may adjudge death. _

 See_ subsection (b)(3) of this rule. 

 This rule thus combines

two preliminary tests which must be met before death may be adjudged with

a standard which must be applied before death may be adjudged. _Cf.

_ _Barclay v. Florida_ and _Zant v. Stephens,

both supra._ The Working Group considered the capital punishment

provisions of those states which now authorize capital punishment, as well

as the _ALI Model Penal Code_ &sect; 201.6(3), (4) (Tent.

Draft No. 9, 1959) (quoted at _Gregg. v.  Georgia_, _

supra_ at 193 n.44). The ABA Standards do not include specific provisions

for capital punishment. _See ABA Standards, Sentencing Alternatives

and Procedures_ &sect; 18-1.1 (1979). This rule is not

based on any specific state statue. It should be noted, however, that this

rule provides a greater measure of guidance for members than does the Georgia

procedure which has been upheld by the Supreme Court. In Georgia, once a

statutory aggravating factor has been proved, the statute leaves the decision

whether to adjudge death entirely to the jury. _See_ Ga. Code

Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-10-30, 17-10-31 (1982). (In

Georgia, once an aggravating factor has been proved, the burden may effectively

 be on the defendant to show why death should not be adjudged. _See

 Coker v. Georgia, supra_ at 590-91.) Subsection (b)(4)(B) of this

rule  supplies a standard for that decision. Many state statutes adopt a

similar balancing test, although the specific standard to be applied varies. _

 See e.g.,_ Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1302 (1977). _

 Cf._ _Barclay v. Florida, supra._ _See also

_ Analysis, subsection (b)(4)(B), _ infra._ 

### (b) Procedure.

Subsection (1) is intended to avoid surprise and trial delays. _

Cf._ Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10 2(a)(1982). Consistent with

 R.C.M. 701, its purpose is to put the defense on notice of issues in the

 case. This permits thorough preparation, and makes possible early submission

of requests to produce witnesses or evidence. At the same time, this subsection

affords some latitude to the prosecution to provide later notice, recognizing

that the exigencies of proof may prevent early notice in some cases. This

is permissible as long as the defense is not harmed; ordinarily a continuance

or recess will prevent such prejudice.

 _2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (1)(A) is intended to provide early and definitive notice that the case has been referred for trial as a capital case.  Subsection (1)(B) is intended to provide the defense written notice of the aggravating factors it intends to prove, yet afford some latitude to the prosecution to provide later notice, recognizing that the exigencies of proof may prevent early notice in some cases.

 Subsection (2) makes clear that the

prosecution may introduce evidence in aggravation under R.C.M. 1001(b)(4).

Note that depositions are not admissible for this purpose. _See_ Article

49(d). 

 Subsection (3) is based on _Eddings v. Oklahoma

_ and_ Lockett v. Ohio_, both_ supra,_ _

Cf._ _Jurek v. Texas, supra._ The accused in courts-martial

generally has broad latitude to introduce matters in extenuation and mitigation

(_see_ R.C.M. 1001(c)) although the form in which they are

 introduced may depend on several circumstances (_see_ R.C.M.

1001(e)). This subsection reemphasizes that latitude. The rule is not intended

to strip the military judge of authority to control the proceedings. _

Eddings_ and _Lockett_ should not be read so broadly

as to divest the military judge of the power to determine what is relevant

(_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 401, 403) or so decide when a witness

must be produced (_see_ R.C.M. 1001(e)). Those cases, and

this subsection, stand for the proposition that the defense may not be prevented

from presenting any relevant circumstances in extenuation or mitigation. 

 Subsection(4)(A)

establishes the second "threshold" which must be passed before

death may be adjudged. The requirement that at least one specific aggravating

circumstance be found beyond a reasonable doubt is common to many state statutory

schemes for capital punishment. _See, e.g.,_ Del. Code Ann.

tit. 11, &sect; 4209(d)(1977); Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1302(1977);

 Ill. Ann. Stat. Ch. 38, &sect; 9-1(f) (Smith-Hurd 1979), La. Code

Crim. Proc. &sect; 905.3 (West Supp 1982); Md. Ann. Code Art. 27 &sect;

413(d)(1982); Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-50-2-9(a)(Burns

1979). _See generally United  States v. Matthews, supra._ 

 Subsection

(4)(B) establishes guidance for the members in determining whether to adjudge

death, once one or more aggravating factors have been found. 

 Note

that under this subsection any aggravating matter may be considered in determining

whether death or some other punishment is appropriate. Thus, while some factors

may alone not be sufficient to authorize death they may be relevant considerations

to weigh against extenuating or mitigating evidence. _See Barclay

v. Florida_ and _Zant v. Stephens, both supra. See generally

_ R.C.M. 1001(b)(4). 

 The rule does not list extenuating

or mitigating circumstances as do some states. Some mitigating circumstances

 are listed in R.C.M. 1001(c)(1) and (f)(1). _See also_ R.C.M.

 1001(f)(2)(B). No list of extenuating or mitigating circumstances can safely

 be considered exhaustive. _See Eddings v. Oklahoma_ and _

 Lockett v. Ohio, both supra;_ cf._Jurek v. Texas, supra._

Moreover, in many cases, whether a matter is either extenuating or mitigating

 depends on other factors. For example, the fact that the accused was under

the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the offense could be viewed

as an aggravating or an extenuating circumstance. Whether a matter is extenuating

or mitigating is to be determined by each member, unless the military judge

finds that a matter is extenuating or mitigating as a matter of law _

(see e.g.,_ R.C.M. 1001(c)(1) and (f)(1)) and so instructs the members.

In contrast to subsection (b)(4)(A) there is no requirement that the members

agree on all aggravating, extenuating, and mitigating circumstances under

subsection (4)(B) in order to adjudge death. Each member must be satisfied

that any aggravating circumstances, including those found under subsection

(4)(A) substantially outweigh any extenuating or mitigating circumstances,

before voting to adjudge death. 

 The test is not a mechanical

one. _Cf._ _Zant v. Stephens, supra._ The latitude

to introduce evidence in extenuation and mitigation, the requirement that

the military judge direct the members' attention to evidence in extenuating

and mitigation and instruct them that they must consider it, and the freedom

of each member to independently find and weigh extenuating and mitigating

circumstances all ensure that the members treat the accused "with that

degree of uniqueness of the individual" necessary in a capital case. _

See_ _Lockett v. Ohio, supra_ at 605. Thus each member

may place on the scales any circumstance " [which in

fairness and mercy, may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree]

of moral culpability or punishment." _Coker v. Georgia_, _

 supra_ at 591 (1977) (quoting instructions by the trial judge). _

 See also_ _Witherspoon v. Illinois_, 391 U.S. 510

(1968) (concerning disqualifications of jurors in capital cases based on

attitude toward the death penalty). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ The

following stylistic changes were made in R.C.M. 1004(b)(4): first, subparagraph

(a) was rewritten to provide that the members must find "at least"

one factor under subsection (c); second, a new subparagraph (b) was added

to underscore the notice and unanimity requirements with respect to the aggravating

factors and to clarify that all members concur in the same factor or factors;

and third, former subparagraph (B) was redesignated as subparagraph (C),

with an express cross-reference to R.C.M. 1001(b)(4), the general rule governing

aggravating circumstances in sentencing proceedings. 

 Subsection

(5) makes clear the evidence introduced on the merits, as well as during

sentencing proceedings, may be considered in determining the sentence. 

 Subsection

(6) requires additional instructions in capital cases. _See also_ R.C.M.

1005. In determining which aggravating circumstances on which to instruct,

the military judge would refer to those of which the trial counsel provided

notice. Even if such notice had been given, a failure to introduce some evidence

from which the members could find an aggravating circumstance would result

in no instruction being given on that circumstance. _Cf._ R.C.M.

917 The last sentence in this subsection is based on _Eddings v. Oklahoma

_ and _Lockett v. Ohio,_ both_supra._ 

 Subsection

(7) is based on Article 52(b)(1). The requirement for a separate specific

finding of one or more aggravating circumstances is new, and is designed

to help ensure that death will not be adjudged in an inappropriate case.

Subsection (8) operates as a check on this procedure. 

### (c) Aggravating circumstances.

The lists of aggravating circumstances under the laws of the states

 retaining capital punishment were examined and used as guidance for formulating

 the aggravating circumstances listed here. Those jurisdictions do not include

 certain military capital offenses, of course, such as desertion, mutiny,

 misbehavior as a guard, nor do they address some of the unique concerns or

 problems of military life. Therefore, several circumstances here are unique

to the military. These circumstances, which apply to rape and murder, except

as specifically noted, are based on the determination that death is not

grossly disproportionate for a capital offense under the code when such circumstances

exist, and that the death penalty contributes to accepted goals of punishment

in such cases. As to proportionality, the aggravating circumstances together

ensure that death will not be adjudged except in the most serious capital

offenses against other individuals or against the nation or the military

order which protects it. As to goals of punishment, in addition to specifically

preventing the most dangerous offenders from posing a continuing danger to

society, the aggravating circumstances recognize the role of general deterrence,

especially in combat setting. _See United States v. Matthews, supra

_ at 368,; _United States v. Gay, supra_ at 605-06

(Hodgson, C.J., concurring). 

 In a combat setting, the potentiality

of the death penalty may be the only effective deterrent to offenses such

as disobedience, desertion, or misbehavior. The threat of even very lengthy

confinement may be insufficient to induce some persons to undergo the substantial

risk of death in combat. At the same time, the rule ensures that even a servicemember

convicted of such very serious offenses in wartime will not be sentenced

to death in the absence of one or more of the aggravating circumstances. 

 In

some cases proof of the offense will also prove an aggravating circumstance. _

See e.g.,_ Article 99 and subsection(c)(1) of this rule. Note, however,

that the members would have to return a specific finding under this rule

of such an aggravating circumstance before a sentence of death could be based

on it. This ensures a unanimous finding as to that circumstance. A finding

of not guilty does not ensure such unanimity. _ See_ Article

52(a)(2); _United States v. Matthews, supra_ at 379-80; _

United States v. Gay, supra_ at 600. The prosecution is not precluded

from presenting evidence of additional aggravating circumstances. 

 Subsection

(1) reflects the serious effect of a capital offense committed before or

in the presence of the enemy. "Before or in the presence of the enemy"

is defined in paragraph 23, Part IV. Note that one may be "before or

in the presence of the enemy" even when in friendly territory. This

distinguishes this subsection from subsection (6). 

 Subsection

(2) and (3) are based on the military's purpose: protection of national security.

That this interest may be basis for the death penalty is well established. _

See e.g., United States v. Rosenberg_, 195 F.2d 583 (2d Cir. 1952), _

cert. denied_, 344 U.S. 838 (1952). The definition of national security,

which appears at the end of subsection (c), is based on Exec. Order No. 12065

&sect; 6-104 (June 28, 1978), 43 Fed.Reg. 28949, as amended by Exec.

Order No. 12148 (July 19, 1979), 44 Fed.Reg. 43239, and Exec. Order No. 12163

(Sept. 29, 1979), 44 Fed.Reg. 56673, _reprinted at_ 50 U.S.C.A.

&sect; 401 (West Supp 1982). The second ("includes") phrase is

based on Joint  Chiefs of Staff Publication 1. Dictionary of Military and

Associated Terms 228 (1 July 79). Note that not all harm to national security

will authorize death. Virtually all military activities affect national security

in some way. _ Cf._ _Cole v. Young_, 351 U.S.

536 (1956); _United States v. Trottier_, 9  M.J. 337 (C.M.A.

1980). Substantial damage is required to authorize death. The discussion

provides examples of substantial damage. Rape and murder may be aggravated

under subsection (2) because the offender intended to harm national security

or a mission, system, or function affecting national security, by the capital

offense. Intent to harm the mission, system, or function will suffice. It

must be shown, however, that regardless of whether the accused intended to

affect national security, the mission, system, or function must have been

such that had the intended damage been effected, substantial damage to national

security would have resulted. 

 _1986 Amendment:_ R.C.M.

1004(c)(2) was changed in conjunction with the enactment of the new Article

106 _a_. 

 Subsection (4) is similar to an aggravating

circumstance in many states. _See, e.g.,_ Neb. Rev. Stat.

&sect; 29-2523(1)(f)(1979); Miss. Code. Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5)(c)(1981

Supp.); Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(1982). This circumstance

applies to all capital offenses (except rape) under the code; rape is excluded

based on_Coker v. Georgia, supra._ 

 _1986

Amendment:_ R.C.M. 1004(c)(4) was amended by adding a reference to

Article 106a to distinguish this factor from the new aggravating factor in

R.C.M. 1004(c)(12). It was also considered appropriate to exclude 104 from

this aggravating factor. _ See_ R.C.M. 1004(c)(11). 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ R.C.M. 1004(c)(4) was amended to clarify that only

one person other than the victim need be endangered by the inherently dangerous

act to qualify as an aggravating factor. _See United States v. Berg

_, 31 M.J. 38 (C.M.A. 1990); _United States v. McMonagle_,

38 M.J. 53 (C.M.A. 1993). 

 Subsection (5) reflects the special

need to deter the offender who would desert or commit any other capital

offense to avoid hazardous duty. Moreover, the effect such conduct has on

the safety of others (including the offender's replacement) and the success

of the mission justified authorizing death. Note that this circumstance applies

to all capital offenses, including rape and murder. The person who murders

or rapes in order to avoid hazardous duty is hardly less culpable than one

who "only" runs away. 

 Subsection (6) is based on the

special needs and unique difficulties for maintaining discipline in combat

zones and occupied territories. History has demonstrated that in such an

environment rape and murder become more tempting. At the same time the need

for order in the force, in order not to encourage resistance by the enemy

and to pacify the populace, dictates that the sanctions for such offenses

be severe. Once again, in a combat environment, confinement, even of a prolonged

nature, may be an inadequate deterrent. 

 Subsections (7) and (8)

are based generally on examination of the aggravating circumstances for murder

in various states. Subsection (7)(A) is intended to apply whether the sentence

is adjudged, approved, or ordered executed, as long as, at the time of the

offense, the term of confinement is at least 30 years or for life. The possibility

of parole or early release because of "good time" or similar

reasons does not affect the determination. Subsection (7)(F) is based on

18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 351, 1114, and 11751. Subsection (7)(G) is modified

to include certain categories of military persons. Subsection (7)(1) uses

a more objective standard that the Georgia provision found wanting in _

Godfrey v. Georgia, supra._

 _1994 Amendment:_ Subsection

(7)(B) was amended by adding an additional aggravating factor for premeditated

murder--the fact that the murder was drug-related. This change reflects

a growing awareness of the fact that the business of trafficking in controlled

substances has become increasingly deadly in recent years. Current federal

statutes provide for a maximum punishment including the death penalty for

certain drug-related killings. _See_ 21 U.S.C. &sect; 848(e)

(Pub. L. 100-690, &sect;7001(a)(2)).

 _2015 Amendment._ Changes to this paragraph are based on section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011, which superseded the previous paragraph 45, "Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct", in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with "Rape and sexual assault generally." In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 added paragraph 45b, "Rape and sexual assault of a child", and paragraph 45c, "Other sexual misconduct."

 _1986 Amendment:

_ Three changes were made in R.C.M.  1004(c)(7)(F); first, the provision

involving Members of Congress was expanded to include Delegates and Resident

commissioners; second, the word "justice" was added to ensure

that justices of the Supreme Court were covered; and third, the provision

was extended to include foreign leaders in specified circumstances. These

changes are similar to legislation approved by the Senate in S. 1765, 98th

Cong., 1st Sess. (1983).

 _1994 Amendment:_ The

amendment to subsection (c)(7)(I) of this rule defines "substantial

physical harm" and was added to clarify the type of injury that would

qualify as an aggravating factor under the subsection. The definition of

"substantial physical harm" is synonymous with "great bodily

harm" and "grievous bodily harm". _See_ Part

IV, paragraph 43(c). With respect to the term "substantial mental

or physical pain and suffering", _see United States v. Murphy

_, 30 M.J. 1040, 1056-1058 (ACMR 1990). 

 _1999

Amendment:_ R.C.M. 1004(c)(7)(K) was added to afford greater protection

to victims who are especially vulnerable due to their age.

 _1991 Amendment:_ Subsection (c)(8) was based on the Supreme Court's

decision in _Enmund v. Florida_, 458 U.S. 782, 797 (1982),

that the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment prohibits

imposition of the death penalty on a defendant convicted of felony-murder

 [who] d[id] not himself kill, attempt

to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force ... be

employed. The amendment to subsection (c)(8) is based on the Supreme Court's

decision in _Tison v. Arizona_, 481 U.S. 137 (1987) distinguishing _

 Enmund_. In _Tison,_ the Court held that the _

 Enmund_ culpability requirement is satisfied when a defendant convicted

 of felony-murder was a major participant in the felony committed and manifested

 a reckless indifference to human life.

 _2015 Amendment._ Changes to this paragraph are based on section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011, which superseded the previous paragraph 45, "Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct," in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with "Rape and sexual assault generally." In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 added paragraph 45b, "Rape and sexual assault of a child," and paragraph 45c, "Other sexual misconduct."

 Subsection (9) is based

on the holding in _Coker v. Georgia, supra_, that the death

penalty is unconstitutional for the rape of an adult woman, at least where

she is not otherwise harmed. 

 Subsection (10) is based on Article

18. _See also Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International

Military Tribunal_ (International Military Tribunal, Nurenberg, 1974); _

Trials of War Criminals Before the Nurenberg Military Tribunals,_ (U.S.

Gov't Printing Off., 1950-51); _In re Yamashita,_ 327

U.S. 1 (1946).

 _1986 Amendment:_ R.C.M. 1004(c)(11)

was added to implement the statutory aggravating factors found in new Article

106 _ a_. The aggravating factors in R.C.M. 1004(c)(11) were

also considered appropriate for violations of Article 104. It is intended

that the phrase "imprisonment for life was authorized by statute"

in Article 106 _a_(c)(1) include offenses for which the President

has authorized confinement for life in this Manual as authorized in Articles

18 and 55 (10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 818 and 855).

 _2007 Amendment_:  Changes to this paragraph adding sexual offenses other than rape are based on subsection (d) of section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006, which supersedes the previous paragraph 45, Rape and Carnal Knowledge, in its entirety and replaces paragraph 45 with Rape, sexual assault and other sexual misconduct.

### (d) Spying.

This subsection is based on Article 106. Congress recognized that

in case of spying, no separate sentencing determination is required. _

 See_ Article 52(a)(1). The rule provides for sentencing  proceedings

 to take place, so that reviewing authorities will have the benefit of any

 additional relevant information. 

 The Supreme Court has held a

mandatory death penalty to be unconstitutional for murder. _Woodson

v. North Carolina, supra; Roberts (Stanislaus) v. Louisiana, supra._ It

has not held that a mandatory death penalty is unconstitutional for any offense. _

See Roberts (Harry) v. Louisiana, supra_ at 637 n. 5. 

 In

holding a mandatory death sentence for murder to be  unconstitutional, the

plurality in _Woodson_ emphasized that the prevailing view

 before _Furman v. Georgia, supra,_ was decidedly against

mandatory death for murder. Contrarily, death has consistently been the

sole penalty for spying in wartime since 1806. _See_ W. Winthrop, _

Military Law and Precedents_ 765-66 (2d ed. 1920 reprint).

Before 1920 the statue making spying in time of war triable by court-martial

and punishable by death was not part of the Articles of War. _Id.

See_ A.W. 82 (Act of 4 June 1920, Ch. 227, 41 Stat. 804). 

### (e) Other penalties.

The second sentence of this subsection is based on the second sentence

of the third paragraph of paragraph 126 _a_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.), which was in turn based on JAGA 1946/10582; SPJGA 1945/9511; _

United States v. Brewster_, CM 238138, 24 B.R. 173 (1943). As to

the third sentence of this subsection,_see also United States v. Bigger

_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 297, 8 C.M.R. 97 (1953); W. Winthrop,_ supra

_ at 428, 434. 

 _2002 Amendment:_ This change

resulted from the enactment of Article 56a, UCMJ, in section 581 of the National

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-85, 111 Stat.

1629, 1759 (1997).

1969 (Rev.). 

### (d) How given.

 _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 921(d). 

### (e) Required instructions.

The reference in the fourth sentence of the discussion of subsection

 (1) to rehearing or new or other trial is based on paragraph 81 _

 d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence of the first paragraph

 and the second paragraph of the discussion to (1) are based on _United

 States v. Henderson_, 11 M.J. 395 (C.M.A. 1981).  The last clause

of subsection (3) is based on _United States v. Givens_, 11

M.J.  694, 696 (N.M.C.M.R. 1981). The discussion under subsection (4) is

based on the third sentence of paragraph 76 _b_(1) of MCM,

1969 (Rev.) and on_United States v. Davidson_, 14 M.J. 81

(C.M.A. 1982). 

 _1998 Amendment:_ The requirement

to instruct members on the effect a sentence including a punitive discharge

and confinement, or confinement exceeding six months, may have on adjudged

 forfeitures was made necessary by the creation of Article 58b, UCMJ, in section

 1122, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No.

 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 463 (1996). 

### (f) Waived.

This subsection is based on Fed. R. Crim. P. 30. 

## Rule 1006. Deliberations and voting on sentence

 _Introduction._ Except as noted below, this

rule and the discussion are based on Articles 51 and 52 and on paragraphs

76 _ b_(2) and (3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (a) In general.

The first sentence is based on the first sentence of paragraph 76

 _b_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Deliberations.

 _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 921(b) concerning the second,

third, and fourth sentences of this subsection. _See also_ _

United States v. Lampani_, 14 M.J. 22 (C.M.A. 1982). 

### (c) Proposal of sentences.

The second clause of the second sentence of this subsection is new

 and recognizes the unitary sentence concept. _See United States v.

Gutierrez_, 11 M.J. 122, 123 (C.M.A.1981). _See generally

Jackson v. Taylor_, 353 U.S. 569 (1957). 

 _2002

Amendment:_ This change to the discussion resulted from the enactment

of Article 56a, UCMJ, in section 581 of the National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-85, 111 Stat. 1629, 1759 (1997).

### (d) Voting.

As to subsection (3)(A) _see United States v. Hendon_,

 6 M.J. 171, 172-73 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Cates_,

39 C.M.R. 474 (A.B.R. 1968). 

 _2002 Amendment:_ Subsection

(d)(4)(B) was amended as a result of the enactment of Article 56a, UCMJ,

in section 581 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year

1998, Pub. L. No. 105-85, 111 Stat. 1629, 1759 (1997). 

 As to

subsection (d)(5), the second sentence of the third  paragraph of paragraph

76 _b_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) has been limited to Article

118 offenses because, unlike Article 106, findings on an Article 118 offense

do not automatically determine the sentence and do not require a unanimous

vote. _See_ Articles 52(a)(1) and (2). Thus a separate vote

on sentence for an  Article 105 offense is unnecessary. 

 As to

subsection (d)(6) _see United States v. Jones_ , 14 U.S.C.M.A.

177, 33 C.M.R. 389 (1963). The reference to no punishment was added to recognize

this added alternative. 

### (e) Action after sentence is reached.

 _See United States v. Justice_, 3 M.J. 451, 453

(C.M.A. 1977). The second paragraph of the discussion is based on the second

sentence of paragraph 76 _c_. 

## Rule 1007. Announcement of sentence

 _Introduction._ Except as noted below, this rule

and the discussion are based on paragraph 76 _c_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

### (a) In general.

The discussion is based on _United States v. Henderson_ ,

11 M.J. 395 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Crawford_, 12

 U.S.C.M.A. 203, 30 C.M.R. 203 (1961). 

 The requirement that the

sentence announcement include a reference to the percentage of agreement

or an affirmation that voting was by secret written ballot has been deleted.

Article 53 does not require such an announcement, and when instructions incorporating

such matters are given, the court-martial "is presumed to have complied

with the instructions given them by the judge." _United States

v. Ricketts_, 1 M.J.. 78, 82 (C.M.A. 1975). _See United States

v. Jenkins_, 12 M.J. 222 (C.M.A. 1982). _Cf._ _

United States v. Hendon_, 6 M.J. 171, 173-74 (C.M.A. 1979).

### (c) Polling prohibited.

 _See_ Analysis, Rule 923(e). 

## Rule 1008. Impeachment of sentence

 This rule is based on Mil. R. Evid. 606(b) and _United

 States v. West_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 77, 48 C.M.R. 548 (1974). _

See United States v. Bishop_, 11 M.J. 7 (C.M.A. 1981). 

## Rule 1009. Reconsideration of sentence

 _Introduction._ Except as noted below, this

rule and discussion are based on Articles 52(c) and 62 and paragraphs 76 _

 c_ and _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (c) Initiation of reconsideration.

Subsection (2)(A) was added to remedy the situation addressed in

 _United States v. Taylor_, 9 M.J. 848 (N.C.M.R. 1980). It

is intended that the military judge have the authority to reduce a sentence

 imposed by that judge based on changed circumstances, as long as the case

 remained under that judge's jurisdiction. Since this action "undercuts

 the review powers" (_Id._ at 850) only to the extent

that  it reduces the upper limits available to reviewing authorities, there

is no reason to prevent the military judge from considering additional matters

before finalizing the sentence with authentication. Furthermore, granting

the military judge power to reconsider an announced sentence recognizes that

when sitting without members, the judge performs the same functions as the

members. _See_ Article 16. 

 The procedures in subsection

(2)(B) are necessary corollaries of those set out in the fifth and sixth

sentences of paragraph 76 _ c_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.) adapted to

the rules for reconsideration. This clarifies that a formal vote to reconsider

is necessary when reconsideration is initiated by the military judge. MCM,

1969 (Rev.) was unclear in this regard. _See United States v. King,

_ 13 M.J. 838 (A.C.M.R.), _ pet. denied,_ 14 M.J.

232 (1982). 

 Subsection (3) is based on Article 62(b) and_

United States v. Jones_, 3 M.J. 348 (C.M.A. 1977). 

### (d) Procedure with members.

Subsection (1) is based on the general requirement for instructions

 on voting procedure. _See United States v. Johnson_, 18 U.S.C.M.A.

436, 40 C.M.R. 148 (1969). It applies whether reconsideration is initiated

by the military judge or a member, since R.C.M. 1006(d)(3)(A) does not permit

further voting after a sentence is adopted and there is no authority for

the military judge to suspend that provision. 

 _1995 Amendment:

_ This rule was changed to prevent a sentencing authority from reconsidering

a sentence announced in open session.  Subsection (b) was amended to allow

reconsideration if the sentence was less than the mandatory maximum prescribed

for the offense or the sentence exceeds the maximum permissible punishment

for the offense or the jurisdictional limitation of the court-martial. Subsection

(c) is new and provides for the military judge to clarify an announced sentence

that is ambiguous. Subsection (d) provides for the convening authority to

exercise discretionary authority to return an ambiguous sentence for clarification,

or take action consistent with R.C.M. 1107. 

 _2002 Amendment:

_ Subsection (e)(3)(B)(ii) was amended as a result of the enactment

of Article 56a, UCMJ, in section 581 of the National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1998, Pub. L. No.  105-85, 111 Stat. 1629, 1759 (1997).

## Rule 1010. Advice concerning post-trial and appellate rights

This rule is based on S.Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1983).

 _See also_ Articles 60, 61, 64, 66, 67, and 69. It is similar

to Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(a)(2), but is broader in that it applies whether or

not the accused pleaded guilty. This is because the accused's post-trial

and appellate rights are the same, regardless of the pleas, and because the

powers of the convening authority and the Court of Criminal Appeals to reduce

the sentence are important even if the accused has pleaded guilty. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ This rule was changed to delete subsection(b) which

required an inquiry by the military judge. The Senate Report addresses only

advice; inquiry to determine the accused's understanding is deemed unnecessary

in view of the defense counsel's responsibility in this area. 

 _

1991 Amendment:_ This rule was changed to place the responsibility

for informing the accused of post-trial and appellate rights on the defense

counsel rather than the military judge. Counsel is better suited to give

this advisement in an atmosphere in which the accused is more likely to comprehend

the complexities of the rights. 

## Rule 1011. Adjournment

 This rule is based on paragraph 77 _b_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER XI. POST-TRIAL PROCEDURE

## Rule 1101. Report of result of trial; post-trial restraint; deferment of confinement

### (A) Report of the result of trial.

This subsection is based on the first two sentences of paragraph

44 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (B) Post-trial confinement.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 57(b) and on the last sentence

of paragraph 44 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (1) makes

clear that confinement is authorized when death is adjudged, even if confinement

is not also adjudged. _See United States v. Matthews_, 13

M.J. 501 (A.C.M.R.), _rev'd on other grounds,_ 16 M.J. 354

(C.M.A. 1983). _See also_ R.C.M. 1004(e) and Analysis. 

 Subsection

(2) is based on Article 57 and on paragraph 21 _ d_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The person who orders the accused into confinement need not

be the convening authority. _See Reed v. Ohman_, 19 U.S.C.M.A.

110, 41 C.M.R. 110 (1969); _Levy v. Resor_, 17 U.S.C.M.A.

135, 37 C.M.R. 399 (1967). The convening authority may withhold such authority

from subordinates. 

 Article 57(b) provides that a sentence to confinement

begins to run as soon as the sentence is adjudged. The mechanism for an accused

to seek release from confinement pending appellate review is to request deferment

of confinement under Article 57(d). _See_ S.Rep. No. 1601,

90th Cong., 2d Sess. 13-14 (1968); _Pearson v. Cox,_ 10 M.J.

317 (C.M.A. 1981). _See_ subsection (c) of this rule. 

 The

purpose of subsection (2) is to provide a prompt, convenient means for the

command to exercise its prerogative whether to confine an accused when the

sentence of the court-martial authorizes it. The commander may decide that,

despite the sentence of the court-martial, the accused should not be immediately

confined because of operational requirements or other reasons. A decision

not to confine is for the convenience of the command and does not constitute

deferment of confinement. _See_ Article 57(d). An accused

dissatisfied with the decision of the commander may request deferment in

accordance with subsection (c) of this rule. 

 The first sentence

of the second paragraph of paragraph 20 _ d_(1) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.) has been deleted. That sentence provided for post-trial "arrest,

restriction, or confinement to insure the presence of an accused for impending

execution of a punitive discharge." The authority for such restraint

was based on Article 13 which authorized arrest or confinement for persons

awaiting the result of trial. _See Reed v. Ohman, supra; United States

v. Teague,_ 3 U.S.C.M.A. 317, 12 C.M.R. 73 (1953). The Military Justice

Amendments of 1981 Pub. L. No. 97-81, &sect; 3, 95 Stat. 1087

(1981), deleted the language concerning such detention pending the result

of trial. 

### (C) Deferment of confinement.

Subsection (1) is based on the first sentence of paragraph 88 _

 f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on the second and

third sentences of paragraph 88 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(2) is based on the first sentence in Article 57(d) and the third sentence

of paragraph 88_f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The requirement that

the request be written is based on the third paragraph of paragraph 88 _

f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection (3) is based on Article

57(d) and _United States v. Brownd,_ 6 M.J. 338 (C.M.A. 1978). _

See also ABA Standards, Criminal Appeals,_ &sect; 21-2.5

(1978); _Trotman v. Haebel,_ 12 M.J. 27 (C.M.A. 1981); _

Pearson v. Cox, supra; Stokes v. United States,_ 8 M.J. 819 (A.F.C.M.R.

1979), _pet. denied,_ 9 M.J. 33 (1980). _See also_ the

first paragraph of paragraph 88 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

 penultimate sentence recognized the standard of review exercised by the Courts

 of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and other

 reviewing authorities. _See United States v. Brownd, supra._

Because the decision to deny a request for deferment is subject to judicial

 review, the basis for denial should be included in the record. 

 Subsection

(4) is based on the fourth paragraph of paragraph 88 _f_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection (5) is based on the fifth paragraph

of paragraph 88 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on _Pearson

v. Cox, supra._ 

 Subsection (6) modifies the last two paragraphs

of paragraph 88 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) to conform to the

amendment of Article 71(c), _see_ Pub. L. No. 98-209,

&sect; 5(e), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The amendment of Article 71(c)

permits confinement to be ordered executed in the convening authority's initial

action in all cases. Article 57(d) is intended to permit deferment after

this point, however. _See_ S. Rep. No. 1601, 90th Cong., 2d

Sess. 13-14 (1968). Therefore subsection (6) specifically describes

four ways in which deferment may be terminated. The result is consistent

with paragraph 88 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and with _

Collier v. United States,_ 19 U.S.C.M.A. 511, 42 C.M.R. 113 (1970).

Under subsection (A) the convening authority must specify in the initial

action whether approved confinement is ordered executed, suspended, or deferred. _

See_ R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(B), (E). Under subsection (B), deferment may

be terminated at any time by suspending the confinement. This is because

suspension is more favorable to the accused than deferment. Subsections (C)

and (D) provide other specific points at which deferment may be terminated.

Deferment may be granted for a specified period (e.g., to permit the accused

to take care of personal matters), or for an indefinite period (e.g., completion

of appellate review). Even if confinement is deferred for an indefinite period,

it may be rescinded under subsection (D). When deferment is terminated after

the initial action, it will be either suspended or executed. _See

_ subsection (7). The first sentence in the discussion is based on

Article 57(d). The second, third, and fourth sentences are based on the last

two paragraphs of paragraph 88 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(7) is based on the last sentence of Article 57(d) and on _Collier

v. United States, supra._ Note that the information on which the

rescission is based need not be new information, but only information which

was not earlier presented to the authority granting deferment. _Cf.

Collier v. United States, supra._ Note also that the deferment may

be rescinded and the accused confined before the accused has an opportunity

to submit matters to the rescinding authority. _See United States

v. Daniels,_ 19 U.S.C.M.A. 518, 42 C.M.R. 120 (1970). 

 Subsection

(7)(C) is added based on the amendment of Article 71(c). Confinement after

the initial action is not "served." It is deferred, suspended,

or executed. Therefore, after deferment is rescinded, it is ordered executed

(if not suspended). Subsection (7)(C) permits the accused an opportunity

to submit matters before the order of execution, which precludes deferment

under Article 57(d), is issued. 

 _1991 Amendment:_ The

Discussion accompanying this subsection was amended to provide for the inclusion

of the written basis for any denial of deferment in the record of trial.

Although written reasons for denials are not mandatory, and their absence

from the record of trial will not per se invalidate a denial decision, their

use is strongly encouraged. _ See Longhofer v. Hilbert_, 23

M.J. 755 (A.C.M.R. 1986). 

 _1998 Amendment:_ In

enacting section 1121 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 462, 464 (1996), Congress

amended Article 57(a) to make forfeitures of pay and allowances and reductions

in grade effective either 14 days after being adjudged by a court-martial,

or when the convening authority takes action in the case, whichever was earlier

in time. Until this change, any forfeiture or reduction in grade adjudged

by the court did not take effect until convening authority action, which

meant the accused often retained the privileges of his or her rank and pay

for up to several months. The intent of the amendment of Article 57(a) was

to change this situation so that the desired punitive and rehabilitative

impact on the accused occurred more quickly. 

 Congress, however,

desired that a deserving accused be permitted to request a deferment of any

adjudged forfeitures or reduction in grade, so that a convening authority,

in appropriate situations, might mitigate the effect of Article 57(a). 

 This

change to R.C.M. 1101 is in addition to the change to R.C.M. 1203. The latter

implements Congress' creation of Article 57(a), giving the Service Secretary

concerned the authority to defer a sentence to confinement pending review

under Article 67(a)(2). 

### (d) Waiving forfeitures resulting from a sentence to confinement to provide

 for dependent support.

 _1998 Amendment:_ This new subsection implements

 Article 58b, UCMJ, created by section 1122, National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 463 (1996).

 This article permits the convening authority (or other person acting under

Article 60) to waive any or all of the forfeiture of pay and allowances forfeited

by operation of Article 58b(a) for a period not to exceed six months. The

purpose of such waiver is to provide support to some or all of the accused's

 dependent(s) when circumstances warrant. The convening authority directs

the waiver and identifies those dependent(s) who shall receive the payment(s).

## Rule 1102.  

 _Introduction._ This rule is based on Article

 60(e) and on paragraphs 80 _c_ and 86 _d_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), all of which concern proceedings in revision. This rule

also expressly authorizes post-trial Article 39(a) sessions to address matters

not subject to proceedings in revision which may affect legality of findings

of guilty or the sentence. _See United States v. Mead_, 16

M.J. 270 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States v. Brickey_, 16 M.J.

258 (C.M.A. 1983); _ United States v. Witherspoon_, 16 M.J.

252 (C.M.A. 1983). _ Cf._ _United States v. DuBay_,

17 U.S.C.M.A. 147, 37 C.M.R. 411 (1967). 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 60(e), on the first sentence

of paragraph 80 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which indicated that

a court-martial could conduct proceedings in revision on its own motion,

and on paragraph 86 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Purpose.

Subsection (1) is based on the second sentence of paragraph 86 _

d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion of subsection (1) is based

on the last paragraph of paragraph 80 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

and on _United States v. Steck_, 10 M.J. 412 (C.M.A. 1981); _

 United States v. Barnes_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 169, 44 C.M.R. 223 (1972);

 _United States v. Hollis_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 235, 29 C.M.R. 51

 (1960). As to subsection (2), _see_ the _ Introduction,

_ Analysis, this rule. The discussion of subsection 21 is based on _

United States v. Anderson, supra._ 

 _1994 Amendment:

_ The amendment to subsection (b)(2) of this rule clarifies that

Article 39(a), UCMJ, authorizes the military judge to take such action after

trial and before authenticating the record of trial as may be required in

the interest of justice. _See United States v. Griffith_,

27 M.J. 42, 47 (C.M.A. 1988). The amendment to the Discussion clarifies

that the military judge may take remedial action on behalf of an accused

without waiting for an order from an appellate court. Under this subsection,

the military judge may consider, among other things, misleading instructions,

legal sufficiency of the evidence, or errors involving the misconduct of

members, witnesses, or counsel. _Id.; See United States v. Scaff_,

29 M.J. 60, 65 (C.M.A. 1989). 

### (c) Matters not subject to post-trial sessions.

This subsection is taken from Article 60(e)(2). 

### (d) When directed.

This subsection is based on paragraph 86 _d_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Article 60(e); _United States

v. Williamson_, 4 M.J. 708 (N.C.M.R. 1977), _pet. denied,

_ 5 M.J. 219 (1978). Paragraph 86 _d_ indicated that

a proceeding in revision could be used to "make the record show the

true proceedings." A certificate of correction is the appropriate mechanism

 for this, so the former provision is deleted. Note that a trial session may

be directed, when authorized by an appropriate reviewing authority (_

 e.g.,_ the supervisory authority, or the Judge Advocate General),

even if some or all of the sentence has been executed.

 _2007 Amendment_:  For purposes of this rule, the list of appropriate reviewing

authorities included in the 1994 amendment includes any court authorized to review cases on appeal under the UCMJ.

### (e) Procedure.

Subsection (1) is based on paragraph 80 _b_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ R.C.M. 505 and 805 and Analysis. Good

 cause for detailing a different military judge includes unavailability due

to physical disability or transfer, and circumstances in which inquiry into

 misconduct by a military judge is necessary. 

 Subsection (2) is

based on paragraph 80 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection

(2) is more concise than its predecessor; it leaves to the military judge

responsibility to determine what specific action to take. 

 Subsection

(3) is based on paragraph 80 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## Rule 1102A. Post-trial hearing for person found not guilty only be reason of lack

of mental responsibility.

 _1998 Amendment:_ This new Rule implements

 Article 76b(b), UCMJ. Created in section 1133 of the National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 464-66 (1996),

it provides for a post-trial hearing within forty days of the finding that

the accused is not guilty only by reason of a lack of mental responsibility.

 Depending on the offense concerned, the accused has the burden of proving

either by a preponderance of the evidence, or by clear and convincing evidence,

that his or her release would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury

to another person or serious damage to property of another due to a present

mental disease or defect. The intent of the drafters is for R.C.M. 1102A

to mirror the provisions of sections 4243 and 4247 of title 18, United States

Code. 

## Rule 1103. Preparation of record of trial

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 54(c) and on the first sentence

 of paragraph 82 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) General courts-martial.

Subsection (1)(A) is based on Article 38(a). In Federal civilian

 courts the reporter is responsible for preparing the record of trial. 28

U.S.C. &sect; 753; Fed. R. App.P. 11 (b). The responsibility of the trial

counsel for preparation of the record is established by Article 38(a), however.

Subsection (1)(B) is based on the second paragraph of paragraph 82 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United

States v. Anderson_, 12 M.J. 195 (C.M.A. 1982). 

 Subsection

(2)(A) is based on Article 54(a) and the first sentence of paragraph 82 _

b_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _Cf._ Article 19. 

 Subsection

(2)(B) is based on Article 54(c) and on the third sentence of paragraph 82 _

b_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _ See_ Rep. No. 53, 98th

Cong., 1st Sess. 26 (1983); H.R. Rep. No.491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 27 (1949);

S. Rep. No.486, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 23-24 (1949). _See also

_ Articles 19 and 66; _United States v. Whitman_, 23

U.S.C.M.A. 48, 48 C.M.R. 519 (1974); _United States v. Thompson_,

22 U.S.C.M.A. 448, 47 C.M.R. 489 (1973); _United States v. Whitman

_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 179, 11 C.M.R. 179 (1953). The exception in the stem

of subsection (2)(B) is based on Article 1(14). _See_ Analysis,

subsection (j) of this rule. 

 The first paragraph of the discussion

under subsection (2)(B) is based on the third sentence of paragraph 82 _

b_(1), and paragraphs 82 _b_(2) and (3) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). _ See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 802 concerning the second paragraph

in the discussion. The last paragraph in the discussion is based on the sixth

sentence of paragraph 82 _b_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _2002 Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(2)(B) was amended to implement the

amendment to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section

577 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L.

No. 106-65, 113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing the jurisdictional maximum punishment

at special courts-martial. R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(B) was amended to prevent an

inconsistent requirement for a verbatim transcript between a general court-martial

and a special court-martial when the adjudged sentence of a general court-martial

does not include a punitive discharge or confinement greater than six months,

but does include forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for more than six

months but not more than 12 months.

 _2008 Amendment_. Subsection (b)(2)(B) was amended to change the requirement to prepare a "verbatim written transcript" to only a "verbatim transcript." This was done in conjunction with adding a definition for the word "writing" in R.C.M. 103(20) in an effort to allow for the use of electronic records.

 Subsection (2)(C) is based on the fourth sentence of paragraph 82 _b_(1) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). _See_ Article 54(c)(2). In Federal civilian courts

a verbatim record is generally required in all cases (although not all portions

of the record are necessarily transcribed). _See_ 28 U.S.C.

&sect; 753(b); Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(g) and 12(g); and Fed. R. App. P. 10. _

See also_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 5.1(c). The Constitution requires a record

of sufficient completeness to allow consideration of what occurred at trial,

but not necessarily a verbatim transcript. _Mayer v. Chicago_,

404 U.S. 189 (1971); _Draper v. Washington_, 372 U.S. 487

(1963); _Coppedge v. United States_, 369 U.S. 438 (1962); _

United States v. Thompson, supra._ A summarized record is adequate

for the less severe sentences for which it is authorized. 

 Subsection

(2)(D) is new. It lists items which are, in addition to a transcript of the

proceedings, required for a complete record. _See United States v.

McCullah_, 11 M.J. 234 (C.M.A. 1981). 

 Failure to comply

with subsection (b)(2) does not necessarily require reversal. Rather, an

incomplete or nonverbatim record (when required) raises a presumption of

prejudice which the Government may rebut. _See United States v. Eichenlaub

_, 11 M.J. 239 (C. M.A. 1981); _ United States v. McCullah,

supra;_ _United States v. Boxdale_, 22 U. S.C.M.A.

414, 47 C. M.R. 35 (1973). As to whether an omission is sufficiently substantial

to raise the presumption, _see_ _United States v. Gray

_, 7 M.J. 296 (C.M.A. 1979); _ United States v. Sturdivant

_, 1 M.J. 256 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v. Webb_,

23 U.S.C.M.A. 333, 49 C.M.R. 667 (1975); _ United States v. Boxdale,

supra; United States v. Richardson_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 383, 45 C.M.R.

157 (1972); _United States v. Weber_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 82, 42

C.M.R. 274 (1970); _United States v. Donati_, 14 U.S.C.M.A.

235, 34 C.M.R. 15 (1963); _United States v. Nelson_, 3 U.S.C.M.A.

482, 13 C.M.R. 38 (1953). 

 _1991 Amendment:_ Subsection

(b)(2)(D)(iv) was redesignated as subsection (b)(2)(D)(v), and new subsection

(b)(2)(D)(iv) was added. The 1984 rules omitted any requirement that the

convening authority's action be included in the record of trial. This amendment

corrects that omission. 

 Subsection (3) is based on paragraph

82 _b_(5), the last sentence of paragraph 84 _c_,

paragraph 85 _ d_, the third sentence of the third paragraph

of paragraph 88 _ f_, the penultimate sentence of paragraph

88 _g_, and the last sentence of paragraph 91 _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev. ). _See also_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong.,

1st Sess. 26 (1983); R.C.M. 1106(f) and Analysis; and _United States

v. Lott_, 9 M.J. 70 (C.M.A. 1980). 

 _1995 Amendment:

_ Punishment of confinement on bread and water or diminished rations

[R.C.M. 1003(d)(9)], as a punishment imposable by a court-martial,

was deleted. Consequently, the requirement to attach a Medical Certificate

to the record of trial [R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(L)] was deleted.

Subsections (3)(M) and (3)(N) were redesignated (3)(L) and (3)(M), respectively.

### (c) Special courts-martial.

This subsection is based on Articles 19 and 54(c) and paragraph

83 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _2002 Amendment:_ Subsection

(c) was amended to implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article

19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65, 113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing

the jurisdictional maximum punishment at special courts-martial. R.C.M. 1103(c)

was amended to conform the requirements for a verbatim transcript with the

requirements of Article 19 for a "complete record" in cases where

the adjudged sentence includes a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more

than six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months. 

### (e) Acquittal; termination prior to findings.

This subsection is based on the fifth sentence of paragraph 82 _

b_(1) and the third sentence of paragraph 83 _b_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The language of paragraph 82 _b_(1) which

 referred to termination "with prejudice to the Government" has

been modified. If the court-martial terminates by reason of mistrial, withdrawal,

or dismissal of charges, a limited record is authorized, whether or not the

 proceedings could be reinstituted at another court-martial.

 _2008 Amendment_. Section (e) was amended to authorize a limited record in cases in which a discharge in lieu of court-martial is approved after findings of the court martial have been made.

### (f) Loss of notes or recordings of the proceedings.

This subsection is based on paragraph 82 _i_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev. ). _See also_ _United States v. Lashley

_, 14 M.J. 7 (C.M.A. 1982); _ United States v. Boxdale. supra.

_ 

 _2002 Amendment:_ Subsection (f)(1) was

amended to implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ)

contained in section 577 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

Year 2000, P. L. No. 106Sec. 65, 113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing the jurisdictional

maximum punishment at special courts-martial. R.C.M. 1103(f)(1) was amended

to include the additional limitations on sentence contained in Article 19,

UCMJ. 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ Subsection (f)(2) was amended

to reflect amendments to Article 63, UCMJ, in the National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub.L.No. 102-484, 106 Stat. 2315, 2506 (1992).

 The revisions provide that subsection (f)(2) sentencing limitations are properly

applicable only to the sentence that may be approved by the convening authority

following a rehearing. Subsection (f)(2) as revised does not limit the maximum

sentence that may be adjudged at the rehearing. _See United States

v. Gibson_, 43 M.J. 343 (1995); _United States v. Lawson,_ 34

M.J. 38 (C.M.A. 1992)(Cox, J., concurring); _United States v. Greaves,

_ 48 M.J. 885 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. 1998), _rev. denied,_ 51

M.J. 365 (1999).

### (g) Copies of the record of trial.

Subsection (1) is based on the first paragraph of paragraph 49_

 b_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The trial counsel is responsible for

 preparation of the record (_see_ Article 38(a)), although,

as paragraph 49 _b_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) indicated, ordinarily

the court reporter actually prepares the record. In subsection (A), the number

of copies required has been increased from two to four to conform to current

practice.

 _1993 Amendment:_ Subsection (g)(1)(A)

was amended by adding the phrase "and are subject to review by a Court

of Criminal Appeals under Article 66" to eliminate the need to make

four copies of verbatim records of trial for courts-martial which are not

subject to review by a Court of Criminal Appeals. These cases are reviewed

in the Office of the Judge Advocate General under Article 69 and four copies

are not ordinarily necessary.

 _2008 Amendment_. Subsection (g)(1)(A) was amended to eliminate the need to make additional copies of the record of trial and allow for transmission of electronic records.

### (h) Security classification.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of paragraph 82 _

d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The remainder of that paragraph is deleted

as unnecessary. 

### (i) Examination of the record.

Subsection (1)(A) and the first paragraph of the discussion are

based on the first paragraph of paragraph 82 _e_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

 Subsection (1)(B) is based on the first sentence of the

second paragraph of paragraph 82 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The first paragraph of the discussion is based on _ United States v.

Anderson, supra_ at 197. Examination before authentication will improve

the accuracy of the record, reduce the possibility of the necessity for a

certificate of correction, and obviate the problems discussed in _

Anderson_. The first paragraph of the discussion is based on the

fourth and fifth sentences of the second paragraph of paragraph 82 _

e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United

States v. Anderson, supra_ at 197. The second paragraph of the discussion

is based on_United v. Anderson, supra._ _See also_ _

United States v. Everett_, 3 M.J. 201, 202 (C.M.A. 1977). The third

paragraph of the discussion is based on the second sentence of the second

 paragraph of paragraph 82 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (j) Videotape and similar records.

This subsection is new and is based on Article 1(14), which is also

 new. _See_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209,

 &sect; 6(a), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). This subsection implements Article 1(14)

in accordance with guidance in S.Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 25-26

(1983). The concerns expressed in _United States v. Barton_,

6 M.J. 16 (C.M.A. 1978) were also considered. 

 Subsection (1)

provides for recording courts-martial by videotape, audiotape, or similar

means, if authorized by regulation of the Secretary concerned. Such Secretarial

authorization is necessary to ensure that this procedure will be used only

when appropriate equipment is available to permit its effective use, in accordance

with the requirements for this rule. Such equipment includes not only devices

capable of recording the proceedings accurately, but playback equipment adequate

to permit transcription by trained personnel or examination by counsel and

reviewing authorities. In addition, if transcription is not contemplated,

the recording method used must be subject to production of duplicates for

compliance with subsection (j)(5) of this rule. 

 Subsection (2)

requires that, ordinarily, the record will be reduced to writing, even if

recorded as described in subsection (1). This preference for a written record

is based on the fact that such a record is easier to use by counsel, reviewing

authorities, and the accused, and is often easier to produce in multiple

copies. _Cf._ _United States v. Barton, supra._ Note,

however, that the rule permits recording proceedings and transcribing them

later without using a court reporter. This adds a measure of flexibility

in the face of a possible shortage of court reporters. This subsection is

consistent with the already common practice of using "back-up"

recordings to prepare a record when the court reporter's equipment has failed.

 _2008 Amendment_.  Subsection (j)(2) was amended to reference the new definition of "writing" as found in RCM 103.

 Subsection (3) recognizes that military exigencies may prevent transcription of the

record, especially at or near the situs of the trial. In such instances,

where an accurate record already exists, the convening authority's action

should not be postponed for lack of transcription, subject to the provisions

in subsection (3). Thus, the convening authority may take action, and transcription

for appellate or other reviewing authorities may occur later. _See

_ subsection (4). Note that additional copies of the record need

not be prepared in such case, except as required in subsection (j)(5)(A).

Note also, however, that facilities must be reasonably available for use

by the defense counsel (and when appropriate the staff judge advocate or

legal officer, _see_ R.C.M. 1106) to listen to or view and

listen to the recordings to use this subsection. 

 Subsection (4)(A)

is based on the recognition that it is impracticable for appellate courts

and counsel not to have a written record. _See_ S.Rep. No.

53, _supra_ at 26; _ United States v. Barton, supra.

_ Note that the transcript need not be authenticated under R.C.M.

1104. Instead, under regulations of the Secretary concerned the accuracy

of the transcript can be certified by a person who has viewed and/or heard

the authenticated recording. 

 Subsection (4)(B) provides flexibility

in cases not reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeals. Depending on regulations

of the Secretary, a written record may never be prepared in some cases. Many

cases not reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals will be reviewed only locally. _

See_ R.C.M. 1112. The same exigencies which weigh against preparation

of a written record may also exist before such review. If a written record

in not prepared, the review will have to be conducted by listening to or

viewing and listening to the authenticated recording. 

 Subsection

(5) provides alternative means for the government to comply with the requirement

to serve a copy of the record of trial on the accused. Article 54(d). Note

that if a recording is used, the Government must ensure that it can provide

the accused reasonable opportunity to listen to or view and listen to the

recording. 

## Rule 1103A. Sealed exhibits and proceedings

 This rule shall be implemented in a manner consistent with Executive Order 12958, as amended, concerning classified national security information.

 _2005 Amendment_:  The 1998 Amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial introduced the requirement to seal Mil. R. Evid. 412 (rape shield) motions, related papers, and the records of the hearings, to "fully protect an alleged victim of 'sexual assault' against invasion of privacy and potential embarrassment."  MCM Appendix 22, p. 36.  As current Rule 412(c)(2) reads, it is unclear whether appellate courts are bound by orders sealing Rule 412 information issued by the military judge.

 The effect and scope of a military judge's order to seal exhibits, proceedings, or materials is similarly unclear.  Certain aspects of the military justice system, particularly during appellate review, seemingly mandate access to sealed materials.  For example, appellate defense counsel have a need to examine an entire record of trial to advocate thoroughly and knowingly on behalf of a client.  Yet there is some uncertainty about appellate defense counsel's authority to examine sealed materials in the absence of a court order.  This authority applies to both military and civilian appellate defense counsel.

 The rule is designed to respect the privacy and other interests that justified sealing the material in the first place, while at the same time recognizing the need for certain military justice functionaries to review that same information.  The rule favors an approach relying on the integrity and professional responsibility of those functionaries, and assumes that they can review sealed materials and at the same time protect the interests that justified sealing the material in the first place.  Should disclosure become necessary, then the party seeking disclosure is directed to an appropriate judicial or quasi-judicial official or tribunal to obtain a disclosure order.

## Rule 1104. Records of trial: authentication; service; correction; forwarding

### (a) Authentication.

Subsection (1) is new and is self-explanatory.

 _2008 Amendment_. Subsection (a)(1) was amended to allow for the use of an electronic record of trial and to define requirements for service for electronic records.

 Subsection (2) is based on Article 54(a) and (b) and paragraph 82 _f_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The former rule has been changed to require that the record,

or even a portion of it, may be authenticated only be a person who was present

at the proceedings the record of which that person is authenticating. This

means that in some cases (_e.g.,_ when more than one military

judge presided in a case) the record may be authenticated by more than one

person. _See United States v. Credit_, 4 M.J. 118 (C.M.A.

1977); S.Rep. No. 1601, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 12-13 (1968); H.R. Rep. No.

1481, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1968). _See also United States v. Galloway

_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 433, 9 C.M.R. 63 (1953). This subsection also changes

the former rule in that it authorizes the Secretary concerned to prescribe

who will authenticate the record in special courts-martial at which no bad-conduct

discharge is adjudged. _See_ Article 54(b). In some services,

the travel schedules of military judges often result in delays in authenticating

the record. Such delays are substantial, considering the relatively less

severe nature of the sentences involved in such cases. This subsection allows

greater flexibility to achieve prompt authentication and action in such cases.

The second paragraph of the discussion is based on _United States

v. Credit, supra; United States v. Cruz-Rijos_, 1 M.J. 429 (C.M.A.

1976). _See also_ _United States v. Lott_, 9

M.J. 70 (C.M.A. 1980); _Unites States v. Green_, 7 M.J. 687

(N.C.M.R. 1979); _United States v. Lowery_, 1 M.J. 1165 (N.C.M.R.

1977). The third paragraph of the discussion is based on _United States

v. Lott, supra; United States v.Credit, supra._ 

 _

2002 Amendment:_ Subsection (a)(2)(A) was amended to implement the

amendment to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section

577 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L.

No. 106-65, 113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing the jurisdictional maximum punishment

at special courts-martial. R.C.M. 1104(a)(2)(A) was amended to ensure that

the military judge authenticates all verbatim records of trial at special

courts-martial. 

### (b) Service.

Subsection (1)(A) is based on Article 54(d) and the first sentence

of paragraph 82 _g_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) _See also

_ H.R. Rep. No. 2498, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 1048 (1949). 

 Subsection

(1)(B) is based on the third through fifth sentences of the first paragraph

of paragraph 82 _g_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(1)(C) is based on H.R. Rep. No. 549, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1983); _

United States v. Cruz-Rijos, supra._ Service of the record of trial

is now effectively a prerequisite to further disposition of the case. _

See_ Article 60(b) and (c)(2). As a result, inability to serve the

accused could bring the proceeding to a halt. Such a result cannot have been

intended by Congress. Article 60(b) and (c)(2) are intended to ensure that

the accused and defense counsel have an adequate opportunity to present matters

to the convening authority, and that they will have access to the record

in order to do so. Cong. Rec. &sect; 5612 (daily ed. April 28, 1983) (statement

of Sen. Jepsen). As a practical matter, defense counsel, rather than the

accused, will perform this function in most cases. _See_ Article

38(c). Consequently, service of the record on defense counsel, as provided

in this subsection, fulfills this purpose without unduly delaying further

disposition. _See United States v. Cruz-Rijos, supra._ Note

that if the accused had no counsel, or if the accused's counsel could not

be served, the convening authority could take action without serving the

accused only if the accused was absent without authority. _ See_ R.C.M.

1105(d)(4) and Analysis. 

 Subsection (1)(D) is based on the third

and fourth paragraphs of paragraph 82 _g_(1) of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

### (c) Loss of record.

This subsection is based on paragraph 82 _h_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). Note that if more than one copy of the record is authenticated

 then each may serve as the record of trial, even if the original is lost.

### (d) Correction of record after authentication; certificate of correction.

Subsection (1) and the discussion are based on paragraph 86 _

 c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ the first paragraph

 of paragraph 95 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (2) is new and is based on

 _United States v. Anderson_, 12 M.J. 195 (C.M.A. 1982). _

 See also_ _ABA Standards, Special Functions of the Trial Judge

_ &sect; 6-1.6 (1978). The discussion is based on_

United States v. Anderson, supra._ Subsection (3) is based on the

second paragraph of paragraph 82 _g_(1) and paragraph 86 _

 c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (e) Forwarding.

This subsection is based on Article 60. The code no longer requires

 the convening authority to review the record. However, a record of trial

must be prepared before the convening authority takes action. _See

_ Article 60(b)(2) and (3), and (d). Therefore, it is appropriate

to forward the record, along with other required matters, to the convening

authority. This subsection is consistent with the first two sentences of

paragraph 84 _ a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

2002 Amendment:_ Subsection (e) was amended to implement the amendment

to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the

National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65,

113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing the jurisdictional maximum punishment at

special courts-martial. This amendment reflects the change to R.C.M. 1106

for special court- martial with an adjudged sentence that includes confinement

for one year. 

## Rule 1105. Matters submitted by the accused

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Articles 38(c) and 60(b). _See

 also_ paragraphs 48 _k_(2) and 77 _a_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Matters which may be submitted.

This subsection is based on Articles 38(c) and 60(b). The post-trial

 procedure as revised by the Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209,

97 Stat. 1393 (1983) places a heavier responsibility on the defense to take

steps to ensure that matters it wants considered are presented to the convening

 authority. Therefore this subsection provides guidance as to the types of

 matters which may be submitted. _See_ Article 38(c). _

See also_ paragraph 48 _k_(3) and 77 _a_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note that the matters the accused submits must be forwarded

 to the convening authority. _See United States v. Siders_,

15 M.J. 272 (C.M.A. 1983). As to the last paragraph in the discussion, _

see also_ Mil. R. Evid. 606(b) and Analysis; _United States

 Bishop_, 11 M.J. 7 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. West_ ,

23 U.S.C.M.A. 77, 48 C.M.R. 458 (1974); _United States v. Bourchier

_, 5 U.S.C.M.A. 15, 17 C.M.R. 15 (1954). 

 _1995

Amendment:_ The Discussion accompanying subsection (b)(4) was amended

to reflect the new requirement, under R.C.M. 1106(d)(3)(B), that the staff

judge advocate or legal advisor inform the convening authority of a recommendation

for clemency by the sentencing authority, made in conjunction with the announced

sentence.

 _2015 Amendment_: R.C.M. 1105(b) was revised to implement Section 1706 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to offenses occurring on or after 24 June 2014.

### (c) Time periods.

This subsection is based on Article 60(b). Subsection (4) clarifies

 the effect of post-trial sessions. A re-announcement of the same sentence

would not start the time period anew. Subsection (5) is based on H.R. Rep.

No. 549, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1983). 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ Subsection (c) was revised to reflect amendments to Article 60,

UCMJ, in the "Military Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII,

&sect; 806, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub.L.

No. 99-661, 100 Stat, 3905, (1986). These amendments simplify post-trial

submissions by setting a simple baseline for calculating the time for submissions. 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ Subsection (c)(1) was amended to clarify that the

accused has 10 days to respond to an addendum to a recommendation of the

staff judge advocate or legal officer when the addendum contains new matter. _

See United States v. Thompson_, 25 M.J. 662 (A.F.C.M.R. 1987). An

additional amendment permits the staff judge advocate to grant an extension

of the 10-day period. 

### (d) Waiver.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 60(c)(2). Subsection (2) is based

 on Article 60(c)(2). This subsection clarifies that the defense may submit

 matters in increments by reserving in writing its right to submit additional

 matters within the time period. In certain cases this may be advantageous

to the defense as well as the Government, by permitting early consideration

of such matters. Otherwise, if the defense contemplated presenting additional

 matters, it would have to withhold all matters until the end of the period.

 Subsection (3) is based on Article 60(b)(4). Subsection (4) ensures that

the accused cannot, by an unauthorized absence, prevent further disposition

of the case. Cf. _United States v. Schreck_, 10 M.J. 226 (C.M.A.

1983). Note that if the accused has counsel, counsel must be served a copy

of the record (_see_ R.C.M. 1104(b)(1)(C)) and that the defense

will have at least 7 days from such service to submit matters. Note also

that the unauthorized absence of the accused has no effect on the 30, 20,

or 7 day period from announcement of the sentence within which the accused

may submit matters (except insofar as it may weigh against any request to

extend such a period). The discussion notes that the accused is not required

to raise matters, such as allegations of legal error, in order to preserve

them for consideration on appellate review. 

## Rule 1106. Recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 60(d), _as amended,

_ _see_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209,

&sect; 5(a)(1), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The first paragraph of paragraph 85 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was similar. 

 _2002 Amendment:

_ Subsection (a) was amended to implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C.

Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the National Defense

Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65, 113 Stat. 512

(1999) increasing the jurisdictional maximum punishment at special courts-martial.

This amendment requires all special courts-martial cases subject to appellate

review to comply with this rule. 

### (b) Disqualification.

This subsection is based on Article 6(c) and on the second paragraph

 of paragraph 85 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Legal officers have

 been included in its application based on Article 60(d). The discussion notes

 additional circumstances which have been held to disqualify a staff judge

 advocate. The first example is based on _United States v. Thompson

_, 3 M.J. 966 (N.C.M.R. 1977), _rev'd on other grounds,_ 6

M.J. 106 (C.M.A. 1978), _petition dismissed_, 7 M.J. 477 (C.M.A.

1979). The second example is based on _United States v. Choice_,

23 U.S.C.M.A. 329, 49 C.M.R. 663 (1975). _See also_ _

United States v. Cansdale_, 7 M.J. 143 (C.M.A. 1979); _ United

States v. Conn_, 6 M.J. 351 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States

v. Reed_, 2 M.J. 64 (C.M.A. 1976). The third example is based on _

United States v. Conn_ and _United States v. Choice,_ both _

supra._ _Cf._ Articles 1(9); 6(c); 22(b); 23(b). The

fourth example is based on _United States v. Collins_, 6 M.J.

256 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Engle_, 1 M.J. 387 (C.M.A.

1976). _See also_ _United States v. Newman_,

14 M.J. 474 (C.M.A. 1983) as to the disqualification of a staff judge advocate

or convening authority when immunity has been granted to a witness in the

case. 

 _1986 Amendment:_ The phrase "or any

 reviewing officer" was changed to "to any reviewing officer"

 to correct an error in MCM, 1984. 

### (c) When the convening authority does not have a staff judge advocate or

 legal officer or that person is disqualified.

Subsection (1) is based on the third paragraph of paragraph 85 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Legal officers have been included in its

application based on Article 60(d). Subsection (2) is new. It recognizes

the advantages of having the recommendation prepared by a staff judge advocate.

 This flexibility should also permit more prompt disposition in some cases

as well. 

### (d) Form and content of recommendation.

This subsection is based on Article 60(d) and on S.Rep. No. 53,

98th Cong., 1st Sess. 20 (1983). As to the subsection (1), _see also

_ Article 60(c). Subsections (3), (4), and (5) conform to the specific

guidance in S.Rep. No. 53, _supra._ Subsection (6) is based

on S.Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1983). The recommendation should

be a concise statement of required and other matters. Summarization of the

evidence and review for legal error is not required. Therefore paragraph

85 _ b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) is deleted. 

 Paragraph

85 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) is also deleted. That paragraph

stated that the convening authority should explain any decision not to follow

the staff judge advocate's recommendation. _See also_ _

United States v. Harris_, 10 M.J. 276 (C.M.A. 1981); _ United

States v. Dixson_, 9 M.J. 72 (C.M.A. 1980); _United States

v. Keller_, 1 M.J. 159 (C.M.A. 1976). The convening authority is

no longer required to examine the record for legal or factual sufficiency.

The convening authority's action is solely a matter of command prerogative.

Article 60(c). Therefore the convening authority is not obligated to explain

a decision not to follow the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or

legal officer. 

 _1995 Amendment:_ Subsection (d)(3)(B)

is new. It requires that the staff judge advocate's or legal advisor's recommendation

 inform the convening authority of any clemency recommendation made by the

 sentencing authority in conjunction with the announced sentence, absent a

 written request by the defense to the contrary. Prior to this amendment,

an accused was responsible for informing the convening authority of any such

 recommendation. The amendment recognizes that any clemency recommendation

is so closely related to the sentence that staff judge advocates and legal

 advisors should be responsible for informing convening authorities of it.

The accused remains responsible for informing the convening authority of

other recommendations for clemency, including those made by the military

judge in a trial with member sentencing and those made by individual members. _

 See_ _United States v. Clear_, 34 M.J. 129 (C.M.A.

1992); R.C.M. 1105(b)(4). Subsections (d)(3)(B) - (d)(3)(E) are redesignated

as (d)(3)(C) - (d)(3)(F), respectively.

 _2008 Amendment:_ Subsections (d)(1) and (d)(3) were modified to simplify the requirements of the staff judge advocate's or legal officer's recommendation.

 _2010 Amendment:_ Subsection (d) is restated in its entirety to clarify that subsections (d)(4), (d)(5) and (d)(6) were not intended to be eliminated by the 2008 Amendment.

 _2008 and 2010 Amendments_. Section (d) was amended to change the required contents of the staff judge advocates recommendation. This section no longer requires a staff judge advocate to provide a summary of the accused's service record and allows for the use of personnel records of the accused instead.  This section was also amended to adjust the required contents into a more concise statement of what is required.  The 2008 amendment appeared to have resulted in the deletion of subsections (d)(4) through (d)(6). Therefore, in 2010 this subsection was again modified to make clear that subsection (d) would continue to have six sub-parts: (d)(1) through (d)(6).

### (e) No findings of guilty.

This subsection is based on Article 60 and 63. When no findings

of guilty are reached, no action by the convening authority is required.

 Consequently, no recommendation by the staff judge advocate or legal officer

is necessary. The last paragraph of paragraph 85 _b_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.), which was based on Article 61 (before it was amended), was similar. 

 _

1990 Amendment:_ Subsection (e) was amended in conjunction with the

implementation of findings of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental

responsibility provided for in Article 50 _a_, UCMJ (Military

Justice Amendments of 1986, tit. VIII, &sect; 802, National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub. L. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986)). 

### (f) Service of recommendation on defense counsel; defense response.

This subsection is based on Article 60(d). _See also_ _

United States v. Goode_, 1 M.J. 3 (C.M.A. 1975). Subsection (1) is

based on Article 60(d). _See also_ _United States v.

Hill_, M.J. 295 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Goode, supra.

_ 

 _1990 Amendment:_ Subsection (f)(1) was

added to make clear that the accused should be provided with a personal copy

of the recommendation. 

 _1994 Amendment:_ The Discussion

to subsection (f)(l) was amended to correct a grammatical error and to clarify

that the method of service of the recommendation on the accused and the accused's

 counsel should be reflected in the attachments to the record of trial. If

it is impractical to serve the accused, the record should contain a statement

 justifying substitute service. Subsection (f)(1) recognizes that Congress

 sanctions substitute service on the accused's counsel. H.R. Rep. No. 549,

98th Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1983). _ See also United States v. Roland

_, 31 M.J. 747 (A.C.M.R. 1990). 

 Subsection (2) makes

clear who is to be served with the post-trial review. _See United

States v. Robinson_, 11 M.J. 218, 223 n.2  (C.M.A. 1981). This issue

has been a source of appellate litigation. _ See e.g., United States

v. Kincheloe_, 14 M.J. 40 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v.

Babcock_, 14 M.J. 34 (C.M.A. 1982); _ United States v. Robinson,

supra; United States v. Clark_, 11 M.J. 70 (C.M.A. 1981); _

United States v. Elliot_, 11 M.J. 1 (C.M.A. 1981); _ United

States v. Marcoux_, 8 M.J. 155 (C.M.A. 1980); _United States

v. Brown_, 5 M.J. 454 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Davis

_, 5 M.J. 451 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Iverson_,

5 M.J. 440 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Annis_, 5 M.J.

351 (C.M.A. 1978). The last sentence in this subsection is based on _

United States v. Robinson, United States v. Brown_, and_ United

States v. Iverson,_ all _supra. _The discussion is

based on _United States v. Robinson, supra._ 

 Subsection

(3) is based on _United States v. Babcock, supra; United States v.

Cruz_, 5 M.J. 286 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Cruz-Rijos

_, 1 M.J. 429 (C.M.A. 1976). Ordinarily the record will have been

provided to the accused under R.C.M. 1104(b). 

 Subsections (4)

and (5) are based on Article 60(d). _See also_ _United

States v. Goode, supra. See United States v. McAdoo_, 14 M.J. 60

(C.M.A. 1982). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (5)

was amended to reflect amendments to Article 60, UCMJ, in the "Military

Justice Amendments of 1986," tit. VIII, &sect; 806, National Defense

 Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub.L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905

 (1986). _See_ Analysis to R.C.M. 1105(c). 

 Subsection

(6) is based on Article 60(d). _See also_ S. Rep. No. 53,

98th Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1983); _United States v. Morrison, supra;

United states v.Barnes_, 3 M.J. 406 (C.M.A. 1982); _United

States v. Goode, supra. But see United States v. Burroughs, supra; United

States v. Moles_, 10 M.J. 154 (C.M.A. 1981) (defects not waived by

failure to comment). 

 Subsection (7) is based on_United

States v. Narine_ , 14 M.J. 55 (C.M.A. 1982). 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ Subsection (f)(7) was amended to clarify that when

new matter is addressed in an addendum to a recommendation, the addendum

should be served on the accused and the accused's counsel. The change also

clarifies that the accused has 10 days from the date of service in which

to respond to the new matter. The provision for substituted service was

also added. Finally, the Discussion was amended to reflect that service of

the addendum should be established by attachments to the record of trial.

## Rule 1107. Action by convening authority

### (a) Who may take action.

This subsection is based on Article 60(c). It is similar to the

first sentence of paragraph 84 _b_ and the first sentence

of paragraph 84 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) except insofar as

the amendment of Article 60 provides otherwise. _See_ Military

Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209, &sect; 5(a)(1), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983).

The first paragraph in the discussion is based on the last two sentences

of paragraph 84 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second paragraph

of the discussion is based on the second and third sentences of paragraph

84 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Conn

_, 6 M.J. 351 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Reed_,

2 M.J. 64 (C.M.A. 1976); _ United States v. Choice_, 23 U.S.C.M.A.

329, 49 C.M.R. 663 (1975). _See also_ _United States

v. James_, 12 M.J. 944 (N.M.C.M.R.), _pet. granted_,

14 M.J. 235 (1982)_rev'd_ 17 M.J. 51. The reference in the

third sentence of paragraph 84 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) to

disqualification of a convening authority because the convening authority

granted immunity to a witness has been deleted. _See United States

v. Newman_, 14 M.J. 474 (C.M.A. 1983). Note that although _

Newman_ held that a convening authority is not automatically disqualified

from taking action by reason of having granted immunity, the Court indicated

that a convening authority may be disqualified by granting immunity under

some circumstances. 

### (b) General considerations.

Subsection (1) and the discussion are based on Article 60(c). _

 See also_ S.Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 19 (1983). 

 Subsection

(2) is based on Article 60(b) and (c). 

 Subsection (3)(A)(i) is

based on Article 60(a). Subsection (3)(A)(ii) is based on Article 60(d).

Subsection (3)(A)(iii) is based on Article 60(b) and (d). Subsection (3)(B)

is based on Article 60 and on S.Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 19-20

(1983). The second sentence in subsection (3)(B)(iii) is also based on the

last sentence of paragraph 85 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also United States v. Vara_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 651, 25 C.M.R. 155

(1958); _United States v. Lanford_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 371, 20 C.M.R.

87 (1955).

 _2014 Amendment:_ The prohibition against considering matters that relate to the character of a victim expands upon the prohibition against considering "submitted" matters that is set forth in section 1706(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, Pub. L. No. 113-66, 127 Stat. 961 (2013). This revision does not incorporate the word "submitted" from section 1706(b), in order to afford greater protection to the victim by progihiting convening authority consideration of any evidence of a victim's character not admitted into evidence at trial, no matter the source.

 Subsection (4) is based on Article 60(c)(3). _

See also_ Article 60(e)(3). This subsection is consistent with paragraph

86 _b_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) except that it does not refer

to examining the record for jurisdictional error. 

 _1990

Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(4) was amended in conjunction with the

implementation of findings of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental

responsibility provided for in Article 50_ a_, UCMJ (Military

Justice Amendments of 1986, tit. VIII, &sect; 802, National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub. L. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986)). 

 Subsection

(5) is based on the second paragraph of paragraph 124 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ _United States v. Korzeniewski_, 7 U.S.C.M.A.

314, 22 C.M.R. 104 (1956); _United States v. Washington_,

6 U.S.C.M.A.114, 19 C.M.R. 240 (1955); _United States v. Phillips

_, 13 M.J. 858 (N.M.C.M.R. 1982). 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ The fourth sentence of subsection (b)(5) was amended to shift to

the defense the burden of showing the accused's lack of mental capacity to

cooperate in post-trial proceedings. This is consistent with amendments to

R.C.M. 909(c)(2) and R.C.M. 916(k)(3)(A) which also shifted to the defense

the burden of showing lack of mental capacity to stand trial and lack of

mental responsibility. The second sentence was added to establish a presumption

of capacity and the third sentence was amended to allow limitation of the

scope of the sanity board's examination. The word "substantial"

is used in the second and third sentences to indicate that considerable more

credible evidence than merely an allegation of lack of capacity is required

before further inquiry need be made. _Ford v. Wainwright_,

477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 2610 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring). 

 _

1998 Amendment:_ Congress created Article 76b, UCMJ in section 1133

of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No.

104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 464-66 (1996). It gives the convening authority

discretion to commit an accused found not guilty only by reason of a lack

of mental responsibility to the custody of the Attorney General.

 _2015 Amendment_: This subsection was revised to implement Article 60(c), UCMJ, as amended by Section 1702 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, as well as Section 1706 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to offenses occurring on or after 24 June 2014. For offenses occurring prior to 24 June 2014, refer to prior versions of R.C.M. 1107(b).

(c) _2015 Amendment_: This subsection was substantially revised to implement Article 60(c), UCMJ, as amended by Section 1702 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to offenses occurring on or after 24 June 2014. For offenses occurring prior to 24 June 2014, refer to prior versions of R.C.M. 1107(c).

(d) _2015 Amendment_: This subsection was substantially revised to implement Article 60(c), UCMJ, as amended by Section 1702 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to offenses occurring on or after 24 June 2014. For offenses occurring prior to 24 June 2014, refer to prior versions of R.C.M. 1107(d).

### (e) Ordering rehearing or other trial.

Subsection (1)(A) is based on Article 60(e), and on paragraph 92

 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note that the decision of the convening

 authority to order a rehearing is discretionary. The convening authority

is not required to review the record for legal errors. Authority to order

a rehearing is, therefore, "designed solely to provide an expeditious

means to correct errors that are identified in the course of exercising discretion

under Article 60(c)." S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1983).

Subsection (1)(B) is based on Article 60(e). As to subsection (1)(B)(ii), _

see_ S. Rep. No. 53, _supra_ at 22. Subsection (1)(B)(ii)

is based on the second sentence of the second paragraph of paragraph 92 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The discussion is based on the second sentence

of the fourth paragraph of paragraph 92 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Subsection (1)(C)(i) is based on Article 62(e)(3) and on the first sentence

of the third paragraph of paragraph 92 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Subsection (1)(C)(ii) and the discussion are based on Article 60(e)(3) and

on the first paragraph of paragraph 92 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Subsection (1)(C)(ii) is based on the first sentence of the tenth paragraph

of paragraph 92 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (1)(D)

is based on the sixth paragraph of paragraph 92 _a_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). Subsection (1)(E) is based on the eighth paragraph of paragraph

92 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Because of the modification of

Article 71 (_see_ R.C.M. 1113) and because the convening authority

may direct a rehearing after action in some circumstances (_see_ subsection

(e)(1)(B)(ii) of this rule), the language is modified. The remaining parts

of paragraph 92 _a_, concerning procedures for a rehearing,

are now covered in R.C.M. 810. 

 _1995 Amendment:_ The

second sentence in R.C.M. 1107(e)(1)(C)(iii) is new. It expressly recognizes

that the convening authority may approve a sentence of no punishment if the

convening authority determines that a rehearing on sentence is impracticable.

 This authority has been recognized by the appellate courts. _See

e.g., United States v. Monetesinos_, 28 M.J. 38 (C.M.A. 1989); _

United States v. Sala_, 30 M.J. 813 (A.C.M.R. 1990). 

_

 2004 Amendment:_ The Discussion to R.C.M. 1107(e)(1)(B)(iii)

was moved to new subsection (1)(B)(iv) to recognize expressly that, in cases

where a superior authority has approved some findings of guilty and has authorized

a rehearing as to other offenses, the convening authority may, unless otherwise

directed, reassess a sentence based on approved findings of guilty under the

criteria established by _United States v. Sales,_ 22 M.J. 305

(C.M.A. 1986), and dismiss the remaining charges. _See United States

v. Harris,_ 53 M.J. 86 (2000). The power of convening authorities

to reassess had been expressly authorized in paragraph 92a of MCM, 1969.

The authorizing language was moved to the Discussion following R.C.M. 1107(e)(1)(B)(iii)

in MCM, 1984. The Discussion was amended to advise practitioners to apply

the criteria for sentence reassessment established by _United States

v. Sales,_ 22 M.J. 305 (C.M.A. 1986). _See also United States

v. Harris,_ 53 M.J. 86 (2000); _United States v. Eversole,

_ 53 M.J. 132 (2000). The Discussion was further amended to encourage

practitioners to seek clarification from superior authority where the directive

to the convening authority is unclear.

 Subsection (2) is based

on paragraph 92 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ paragraph 89 _c_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). If the

accused was acquitted of a specification which is later determined to have

failed to state an offense, another trial for the same offense would be barred. _

United States v. Ball_, 163 U.S. 662 (1896). It is unclear whether

an acquittal by a jurisdictionally defective court-martial bars retrial. _

See United States v. Culver_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 141, 46 C.M.R. 141 (1973).

### (f) Contents of action and related matters.

Subsection (1) is based on paragraph 89 _a_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). 

 _1991 Amendment:_ The 1984 rules

omitted any requirement that the convening authority's action be included

in the record of trial. This amendment corrects that omission. 

 Subsection

(2) is based on paragraph 89 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

second sentence is new. It is intended to simplify the procedure when a defect

in the action is discovered in Article 65(c) review. There is no need for

another authority to formally act in such cases if the convening authority

can take corrective action. The accused cannot be harmed by such action.

A convening authority may still be directed to take corrective action when

necessary, under the third sentence. "Erroneous" means clerical

error only. _See_ subsection (g) of this rule. This new sentence

is not intended to allow a convening authority to change a proper action

because of a change of mind. 

 _1995 Amendment:_ The

amendment allows a convening authority to recall and modify any action after

it has been published or after an accused has been officially notified, but

before a record has been forwarded for review, as long as the new action

is not less favorable to the accused than the prior action. A convening

authority is not limited to taking only corrective action, but may also modify

the approved findings or sentence provided the modification is not less favorable

to the accused than the earlier action. 

 Subsection (3) is based

on paragraph 89 _c_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The provision

in paragraph 89 _c_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) that disapproval

of the sentence also constitutes disapproval of the findings unless otherwise

stated is deleted. The convening authority must expressly indicate which

findings, if any, are disapproved in any case. _ See_ Article

60(c)(3). The discussion is based on paragraph 89 _ c_(2) of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (4)(A) is based on paragraph 89 _c_(3)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The first sentence of paragraph 89 _c_(2)is

no longer accurate. Since no action on the findings is required, any disapproval

of findings must be expressed. Subsection (4)(B) is taken from paragraph

89 _c_(4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (4)(D) is based

on paragraph 89 _c_(6) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). However, because

that portion of the sentence which extends to confinement may now be ordered

executed when the convening authority takes action (_see_ Article

71(c)(2); R.C.M. 1113(b)), temporary custody is unnecessary in such cases.

Therefore, this subsection applies only when death has been adjudged and

approved. Subsection (4)(E) is taken from paragraph 89 _c_(7)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (4)(F) is new. _ See_ Analysis,

R.C.M. 305(k). _See also_ _United States v. Suzuki_,

14 M.J. 491 (C.M.A. 1983). Subsection (4)(G) is taken from paragraph 89 _

c_(9) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (4)(H) is modified based on

the amendment of Article 71 which permits a reprimand to be ordered executed

from action, regardless of the other components of the sentence. Admonition

has been deleted. _See_ R.C.M. 1003(b)(1). 

 Subsection

(5) is based on paragraph 89 _c_(8) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ R.C.M. 810(d) and Analysis. The provision in paragraph

89 _c_(8) requiring that the accused be credited with time

in confinement while awaiting a rehearing is deleted. Given the procedures

for imposition and continuation of restraint while awaiting trial (_

see_ R.C.M. 304 and 305), there should not be a credit simply because

the trial is a rehearing.

 _2015 Amendment_: This subsection was revised to implement Article 60(c), UCMJ, as amended by Section 1702 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to offenses occurring on or after 24 June 2014. For offenses occurring prior to 24 June 2014, refer to prior versions of R.C.M. 1107(f).

### (g) Incomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous action.

This subsection is based on paragraph 95 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See generally United States v. Loft_, 10 J M.J. 266 (C.M.A. 1981);

 _United States v. Lower_, 10 M.J. 263 (C.M.A. 1981). 

### (h) Service on accused.

This subsection is based on Article 61(a), _as amended,

_ _see_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209,

 &sect; 5(b)(1), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

## Rule 1108. Suspension of execution of sentence

This rule is based on Articles 71(d) and 74, and paragraphs 88 _

e_ and 97 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e). The second paragraph of the discussion to

 subsection (b) is based on _United States v. Stonesifer_,

2 M.J. 212 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Williams_, 2 M.J.

74 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v. Occhi_, 2 M.J. 60 (C.M.A.

 1976). Subsection (c) is new and based on Article 71; _United States

v. Lallande_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 170, 46 C.M.R. 170 (1973); _United

 State v. May_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 258, 27 C.M.R. 432 (1959). _

 Cf._ 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3651 ("upon such terms and conditions

as the court deems best"). The notice provisions are designed to facilitate

 vacation when that becomes necessary. _See_ the Analysis,

R.C.M. 1109. The language limiting the period of suspension to the accused's

current enlistment has been deleted. _See United States v. Thomas

_, 45 C.M.R. 908 (N.C.M.R. 1972). _Cf._ _United

States v. Clardy_, 13 M.J. 308 (C.M.A. 1982). _ See also_ subsection

(e) of this rule. 

 _1990 Amendment:_ The third sentence

was amended to delete the limitation of Secretarial designation to an "officer

 exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the

 accused is assigned" and to permit such designation to any "commanding

officer." This comports with the language of Article 74(a), UCMJ and

paragraphs 97 _a_ of MCM, 1951 and MCM, 1969. The specific

designation of inferior courts-martial convening authorities to remit or

suspend unexecuted portions was not intended to limit in any other respects

the Secretarial designation power. Except for a sentence which has been approved

by the President, remission or suspension authority is otherwise left entirely

to departmental regulations. 

 The last sentence was added to clarify

the authority of the officials named in section (b) to grant clemency or

mitigating action on those parts of the sentence that have been approved

and ordered executed but that have not actually been carried out. In the

case of forfeiture the "carrying out " involves the actual collection

after pay accrues on a daily basis. Thus, even when a sentence to total forfeiture

has been approved and ordered executed, the named officials can still grant

clemency or mitigating action. Although a prisoner may be administratively

placed in a nonpay status when total forfeiture has been ordered executed,

the total forfeiture is collected as it would otherwise accrue during the

period that the prisoner is in a nonpay status. If clemency were granted,

the prisoner could be returned administratively to a pay status, pay would

accrue, and any resulting partial forfeiture would be collected as it accrues.

Likewise, that portion of confinement which has not been served is "unexecuted". 

_

 2004 Amendment:_ Subsection (b) was amended to conform to the

limitations on Secretarial authority to grant clemency for military prisoners

serving a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole

contained in section 553 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Pub.L.No. 106-398, 114 Stat. 1654, Oct 30, 2000.

 _2015 Amendment_: This subsection was revised to implement Article 60(c), UCMJ, as amended by Section 1702 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to offenses occurring on or after 24 June 2014. For offenses occurring prior to 24 June 2014, refer to prior versions of R.C.M. 1108(b).

## Rule 1109. Vacation of suspension of sentence

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 72 and paragraph 97 _

 b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Timeliness.

This subsection is based on the fourth paragraph of paragraph 97

 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Pells_ ,

5 M.J. 380 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Rozycki_, 3 M.J.

 127, 129 (C.M.A. 1977). 

### (c) Confinement of probationer pending vacation proceedings.

This subsection is new and based on _Gagnon v. Scarpelli

_, 411 U.S. 778 (1973); _Morrissey v. Brewer_, 408

U.S. 471 (1972); _United States v. Bingham_, 3 M.J. 119 (C.M.A.

1977). It is consistent with Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(a)(1). Note that if the

actual hearing on vacation under subsection (d)(1) or (e)(3) and (4) is completed

within the specified time period, a separate probable cause hearing need

not be held. 

### (d) Violation of suspended general court-martial sentence or of a suspended

 court-martial sentence including a bad-conduct discharge.

This subsection is based on Article 72(a) and (b); the first two

 paragraphs of paragraph 97 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _

 United States v. Bingham, supra; United States v. Rozycki_, supra.

 _See also_ Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(a)(2). 

### (e) Vacation of suspended special court-martial sentence not including

a bad-conduct discharge or of a suspended summary court-martial sentence.

This subsection is based on Article 72(c); _United States

v. Bingham, supra; United States v. Rozycki, supra._ 

 Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(b) is not adopted. That rule requires a hearing before conditions

of probation may be modified. Modification is seldom used in the military.

Because a probationer may be transferred or change duty assignments as a

normal incident of military life, a commander should have the flexibility

to make appropriate changes in conditions of probation without having to

conduct a hearing. This is not intended to permit conditions of probation

to be made substantially more severe without due process. At a minimum, the

probationer must be notified of the changes. 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ Several amendments were made to R.C.M. 1109 to specify that the

notice to the probationer concerning the vacation proceedings must be in

writing, and to specify that the recommendations concerning vacation of the

suspension provided by the hearing officer must also be in writing. _

Black v. Romano_, 471 U.S. 606, 105 S.Ct. 2254 (1985). Several references

to "conditions of probation" were changed to "conditions

of suspension" for consistency of terminology. 

 _

1998 Amendment:_ The Rule is amended to clarify that "the

suspension of a special court-martial sentence which as approved includes

a bad-conduct discharge," permits the officer exercising special court-martial

jurisdiction to vacate any suspended punishments other than an approved suspended

bad-conduct discharge. 

 _2002 Amendment:_ Subsection

(e) was amended to implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article

19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65, 113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing

the jurisdictional maximum punishment at special courts-martial. 

### (f)  Vacation of a suspended special court-martial sentence that includes

a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year.

 Subsection (f) was amended to implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C.

 Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the National Defense

 Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65, 113 Stat. 512 (1999)

 increasing the jurisdictional maximum punishment at special courts-martial.

 This amendment reflects the decision to treat an approved sentence of confinement

for one year, regardless of whether any period of confinement is suspended,

as a serious offense, in the same manner as a suspended approved bad-conduct

discharge at special courts-martial under Article 72, UCMJ, and R.C.M. 1109.

## Rule 1110. Waiver or withdrawal of appellate review

 _Introduction._ This rule is new and is based

on Article 61, as amended,_ see_ Military Justice Act of 1983,

 Pub.L. No. 98-209, &sect; 5(b)(1), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The rule

provides procedures to ensure that a waiver or withdrawal of appellate review

 is a voluntary and informed choice. _See also_ Appendices 19

and 20 for forms. _See_ S. Rep. No. 53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess.

22-23 (1983). 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 61. The discussion is also based

 on Articles 64 and 69(b). 

 _2002 Amendment:_ Subsection

(a) was amended to implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article

19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65, 113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing

the jurisdictional maximum punishment at special courts-martial. 

### (b) Right to counsel.

This subsection is based on Article 61(a). Although Article 61(b)

 does not expressly require the signature of defense counsel as does Article

 61(a), the same requirements should apply. Preferably counsel who represented

 the accused at trial will advise the accused concerning waiver, the appellate

 counsel (if one has been appointed) will do so concerning withdrawal. This

 subsection reflects this preference. It also recognizes, however, that this

may not always be practicable; for example, the accused may be confined a

 substantial distance from counsel who represented the accused at trial when

it is time to decide whether to waive or withdraw appeal. In such cases,

associate counsel may be detailed upon request by the accused. _See

_ R.C.M. 502(d)(1) as to the qualification of defense counsel. Associate

counsel is obligated to consult with at least one of the counsel who represented

the accused at trial. In this way the accused can have the benefit of the

opinion of the trial defense counsel even if the defense counsel is not immediately

 available. Subsection (2)(C) provides for the appointment of substitute counsel

 when, for the limited reasons in R.C.M. 505(d)(2)(B), the accused is no longer

 represented by any trial defense counsel. Subsection (3) contains similar

 provisions concerning withdrawal of an appeal. Note that if the case is

reviewed by the Judge Advocate General, there would be no appellate counsel.

In such cases, subsection (3)(C) would apply. Subsection (6) clarifies that

here, as in other circumstances, a face-to-face meeting between the accused

and counsel is not required. When necessary, such communication may be by

 telephone, radio, or similar means. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid.

 511(b). The rule, including the opportunity for appointment of associate

 counsel, is intended to permit face-to-face consultation with an attorney

in all but the most unusual circumstances. Face-to-face consultation is strongly

 encouraged, especially if the accused wants to waive or withdraw appellate

 review. 

### (c) Compulsion, coercion, inducement prohibited.

This subsection is intended to ensure that any waiver or withdrawal

 of appellate review is voluntary. _See_ S. Rep. No. 53, _

 supra_ at 22-23; _Hearings on S. 2521 Before the Subcomm.

 on Manpower and Personnel of the Senate Comm. on Armed Services,_ 97th

 Cong., 1st Sess. 78, 128 (1982); _United States v. Mills_,

12 M.J. 1 (C.M.A. 1981). _See also_ R.C.M. 705(c)(1)(B).

### (d) Form of waiver or withdrawal.

This subsection is based on Article 60(a) and on S. Rep. No. 53,

 _supra_ at 23. Requiring not only the waiver but a statement,

 signed by the accused, that the accused has received essential advice concerning

the waiver and that it is voluntary should protect the Government and the

defense counsel against later attacks on the adequacy of counsel and the

validity of the waiver or withdrawal. 

### (e) To whom submitted.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 60(a). Article 60(b) does not

 establish where a withdrawal is filed. Subsection (2) establishes a procedure

 which should be easy for the accused to use and which ensures the withdrawal

 will be forwarded to the proper authority. A waiver or withdrawal of appeal

is filed with the convening authority or authority exercising general court-martial

jurisdiction for administrative convenience. _See_ Hearings

on S. 2521, _supra_ at 31. 

### (f) Time limit.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 60(a). Subsection (2) is based

on Article 60(b). _See also_ subsection (g)(3) and Analysis,

below. 

 _1991 Amendment:_ Language was added to

clarify that, although the waiver must be filed within 10 days of receipt

by the accused or defense counsel of the convening authority's action, it

may be signed at any time after trial up to the filing deadline. 

### (g) Effect of waiver of withdrawal, substantial compliance required.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 60(c). Subsections (2) and (3)

are based on Article 64. Subsection (3) also recognizes that, once an appeal

is filed (_i.e.,_ not waived in a timely manner) there may

be a point at which it may not be withdrawn as of right. _Cf._ Sup.

 Ct. R. 53; Fed.R.App. P.42; _Hammett v.Texas_, 448 U.S. 725

 (1974); _Shellman v. U.S. Lines, Inc._, 528 F. 2d 675 (9th

Cir. 1975), _cert. denied_, 425 U.S. 936 (1976). Subsection

(4) is intended to protect the integrity of the waiver or withdrawal procedure

by ensuring compliance with this rule. The accused should be notified promptly

if a purported waiver or withdrawal is defective. 

## Rule 1111. Disposition of the record of trial after action

This rule is based generally on paragraph 91 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.),

but is modified to conform to the accused's right to waive or withdraw appellate

 review and to the elimination of supervisory review and of automatic review

of cases affecting general and flag officers. _See_ Articles

61, 64, 65, 66(b). Some matters in paragraph 91 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) are covered

in other rules. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(F); 1104(b)(1)(B).

 _2008 Amendment_. Subsection (a)(1) was amended to allow for forwarding of electronic records of trial, conforming to RCM 1104 as amended.

 _2002 Amendment:_ R.C.M. 1111(b) was amended to implement the amendment

to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the

National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65,

113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing the jurisdictional maximum punishment at

special courts-martial. The amendment ensures all special courts-martial

not requiring appellate review are reviewed by a judge advocate under R.C.M.

1112. 

## Rule 1112. Review by a judge advocate

This rule is based on Articles 64 and 65(b), _as amended,

 see_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209, &sect;&sect;

 6(d)(1), (7)(a)(1), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ The last paragraph of R.C.M. 1112(d) was added to clarify the requirement

that a copy of the judge advocate's review be attached to the original and

each copy of the record of trial. The last paragraph of R.C.M. 1112(e), which

previously contained an equivalent but ambiguous requirement, was deleted. 

 _

1990 Amendment:_ Subsection (b) was amended in conjunction with the

implementation of findings of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental

responsibility provided for in Article 50 _a_, UCMJ (Military

Justice Amendments of 1986, tit. VIII, &sect; 802, National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub. L. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986)). 

 _

2002 Amendment:_R.C.M. 1112(a)(2) was amended to implement the amendment

to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the

National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P. L. No. 106-65,

113 Stat. 512 (1999) increasing the jurisdictional maximum punishment at

special courts-martial. The amendment ensures all special courts-martial

not requiring appellate review are reviewed by a judge advocate under R.C.M.

1112. 

## Rule 1113. Execution of sentences

 _Introduction._ Fed. R. Crim. P. 38 is inapplicable.

The execution of sentence in the military is governed by the code. _

See_ Articles 57 and 71. _See also_ Articles 60, 61,

64, 65, 66, and 69. 

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 71(c)(2) and the first paragraph

 of paragraph 98 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Articles 60,

61, 64, 65, 66, and 67. 

 _1991 Amendment:_ The

discussion was amended by adding a reference to subsection (5) of R.C.M.

1113(d). This brings the discussion into accord with the general rule of

R.C.M. 1113(d)(2)(A) that any court-martial sentence to confinement begins

to run from the date it is adjudged. 

### (b) Punishments which the convening authority may order executed in the

 initial action.

This subsection is based on Article 71(d). _See also_

the first paragraph of paragraph 88 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Note that under the amendment of Article 71 (_see_ Pub. L.

No. 98-209, &sect; 5(e), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983)), the convening authority may

order parts of a sentence executed in the initial action, even if the sentence

includes other parts (_e.g.,_ a punitive discharge) which

cannot be ordered executed until the conviction is final. 

### (c) Punishments which the convening authority may not order executed in

the initial action.

This subsection is based on the sources noted below. The structure

 has been revised to provide clearer guidance as to who may order the various

 types of punishments executed. Applicable service regulations should be

consulted, because the Secretary concerned may supplement this rule, and may

 under Article 74(a) designate certain officials who may remit unexecuted

 portions of sentences. _See also_ R.C.M. 1206. 

 Subsection

(1) is based on Article 71(c). _See also_ Article 64(c)(3).

The last two sentences of this subsection are based on S.Rep.No. 53, 98th

Cong., 1st Sess. 25 (1983). 

 _1991 Amendment:_ Language

was added to the second sentence of the paragraph following subsection (c)(1)(B)

to specify that a staff judge advocate's advice is required only when the

servicemember is not on appellate leave on the date of final judgment and

more than six months have elapsed since the convening authority's approval

of the sentence. The third sentence was modified to reflect this change.

The subsection was not intended to grant an additional clemency entitlement

to a servicemember. Significant duty performance since the initial approval

is relevant to the convening authority's determination of the best interest

of the service. Since a member on appellate leave is performing no military

duty, an additional staff judge advocate's advice would serve no useful purpose. 

 Subsection

(2) is based on Article 71(b). 

 Subsection (3) is based on Articles

66(b), 67(b)(1), and 71(a). 

### (d) Self-executing punishments.

 _2008 Amendment_. Section (d) has been replaced with a new rule addressing self-executing punishments. The original section (d) has been re-designated as section (e), with no substantive changes to the text.

### (e) Other considerations concerning execution of sentences.

This section was formerly (d) but was re-designated as (e) in 2008. _See_ section (d) above. Subsection (1) is based on the third paragraph of paragraph 126 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second paragraph of paragraph

88 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) is deleted as unnecessary. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (1)(B) was added to incorporate the

holding in _Ford v. Wainwright_, 477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595

(1986). The plurality in _Ford_ held that the Constitution

precludes executing a person who lacks the mental capacity to understand

either that he will be executed or why he will be executed. _ See also

_ _United States v. Washington_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 114,

119, 19 C.M.R. 240, 245 (1955). The Court also criticized the procedures

specified by Florida law used to determine whether a person lacks such capacity

because the accused was provided no opportunity to submit matters on the

issue of capacity, but the case is unclear as to what procedures would suffice. 

 Because

of this ambiguity, the drafters elected to provide for a judicial hearing,

with representation for the government and the accused. This is more than

adequate to meet the due process requirements of _Ford v. Wainwright.

_ 

 The word "substantial" is used in the third

sentence to indicate that considerably more credible evidence than merely

an allegation of lack of capacity is required before further inquiry need

be made. _ Ford v. Wainwright,_ 447 U.S. 399, 426, 106 S.Ct.

2595, 2610 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring). The burden of showing the accused's

lack of capacity is on the defense when the issue is before the court for

adjudication. This is consistent with amendments to R.C.M. 909(c)(2) and

R.C.M. 916(k)(3)(A) which shifted to the defense the burden of showing lack

of mental capacity to stand trial and lack of mental responsibility. The

rule also establishes a presumption of capacity and allows limits on the

scope of the sanity board's examination. 

 Subsection (2)(A) is

based on Articles 14 and 57(b) and paragraph 97 _c_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). _See also_ paragraph 126 _j_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (2)(B) is based on Article 58(b) and the third

paragraph of paragraph 126 _j_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection

(2)(C) is based on Article 58(a) and paragraph 93 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note

that if the Secretary concerned so prescribes, the convening authority need

not designate the place of confinement. Because the place of confinement

is determined by regulations in some services, the convening authority's

designation is a pro forma matter in such cases. The penultimate sentence

in subsection (2)(C) is based on Article 12 and on paragraph 125 of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The last sentence in subsection (2)(C) is based on 10 U.S.C. &sect;

951. _See_ the second paragraph of paragraph 18 _b

_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _2010 Amendment_. Subsection (2)(A)(iii) was amended to correct an incorrect reference to Article 57(e), which does not exist. It now references the correct section of Article 57a.

 _1995 Amendment:_ Subsection

(2)(A)(iii) is new. It is based on the recently enacted Article 57(e).

 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-484,

106 Stat. 2315,2505 (1992). _See generally_ Interstate Agreement

on Detainers Act, 18 U.S.C. App. III. It permits a military sentence to

be served consecutively, rather than concurrently, with a civilian or foreign

 sentence. The prior subsections (2)(A)(iii) - (iv) are redesignated (2)(A)(iv)

- (v), respectively.

 _2010 Amendment_. Subsection (2)(C) was amended to add the same level or protections to "persons serving with or accompanying an armed force" as members of the armed forces receive.

 Subsection (3) is based on paragraph 126 _

h_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), but it is modified to avoid constitutional

problems. _ See Bearden v. Georgia_, 461 U.S. 660 (1983); _

Tate v. Short_, 401 U.S. 395 (1971); _Williams v. Illinois

_, 399 U.S. 235 (1970). _See also_ _United

States v. Slubowski_, 5 M.J. 882 (N.C.M.R. 1978), aff'd, 7 M.J. 461

(1979); _United States v. Vinyard_, 3 M.J. 551 (A.C.M.R.), _

pet. denied_, 3 M.J. 207 (1977); _United States v. Donaldson

_, 2 M.J. 605 (N.C.M.R. 1977), _aff'd_ , 5 M.J. 212

(1978); _United States v. Martinez_, 2 M.J. 1123 (C.G. C.M.R.

1976); _United States v. Kehrli_, 44 C.M.R. 582 (A.F.C.M.R.

1971), _pet. denied_, 44 C.M.R. 940 (1972); ABA Standards,

Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures &sect; 18-2.7 (1979). 

 Subsection

(4) is new. _See_ Article 57(c). 

 Subsection (5)

is based on the last paragraph of paragraph 125 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Paragraph

88 _d_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) is deleted based on the amendment

of Articles 57(a) and 71(c)(2) which eliminated the necessity for application

or deferment of forfeitures. Forfeitures always may be ordered executed in

the initial action. 

 _1995 Amendment:_ Subsection

(5) was deleted when the punishment of confinement on bread and water or

diminished rations [R.C.M. 1113(d)(9)], as a punishment

imposable by a court-martial, was deleted. Subsection (6) was redesignated

(5). 

## Rule 1114. Promulgating orders

### (a) In general.

Subsections (1) and (2) are based on the first paragraph of paragraph

 90 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (3) is based on paragraph

 90 _e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). This rule is consistent in purpose

 with Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(1).

 _2008 Amendment_. Subsection (a)(4) is new and intended to effectuate self-executing punishments under RCM 1113. Pursuant to this change, a command is not required to issue a supplemental promulgating order for self-executing punishments, as the certification of the appropriate official pursuant to RCM 1113 is all that is required.

### (b) By whom issued.

Subsection (1) is based on paragraph 90 _ b_(1) of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.) except that the requirement that the supervisory authority,

 rather than the convening authority, issue the promulgating order in certain

 special courts-martial has been deleted, since action by the supervisory

 authority is no longer required. _See_ Article 65. The convening

 authority now issues the promulgating order in all cases. _See generally

 United States v. Schulthise_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 31, 33 C.M.R. 243 (1963)

 (actions equivalent to publication). Subsection (2) is based on paragraphs

90 _b_(2) and 107 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (c) Contents.

Subsection (1) is based on Appendix 15 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) but

modifies it insofar as the only item which must be recited verbatim in the

 order is the convening authority's action. The charges and specifications

 should be summarized to adequately describe each offense, including allegations

 which affect the maximum authorized punishments. _Cf._ Fed.

R. Crim. P. 32(b)(1). _See also_ Form 25, Appendix of Forms,

 Fed. R. Crim. P. Subsection (2) is based on the third, fourth, and fifth paragraph

of paragraph 90 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) except that reference

is no longer made to action by the supervisory authority. _ See_ Article

65. _See United States v. Veilleux_, 1 M.J. 811, 815 (A.F.C.M.R.

1976); _United States v. Hurlburt_, 1 M.J. 742, 744 (A.F.C.M.R.

1975), rev'd on other grounds, 3 M.J. 387 (C.M.A. 1977). 

 Subsection

(3) is based on the first sentence of the second paragraph of paragraph 90 _

a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _1986 Amendment:_ Reference

to "subsequent actions" was changed to "subsequent orders"

to correct an error in MCM, 1984. 

 _1990 Amendment:_ Subsection

(c)(2) was amended in conjunction with the implementation of findings of

not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility provided for in

Article 50 _a_, UCMJ (Military Justice Amendments of 1986,

tit. VIII, 802, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987,

Pub. L. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986)). 

### (d) Orders containing classified information.

This subsection is based on the first two paragraphs of paragraph

90 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence of the first

 paragraph of paragraph 90 _c_ is deleted as unnecessary.

### (e) Authentication.

This subsection is based on forms at Appendix 15 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

 and clarifies the authentication of promulgating orders. _See_

Mil. R. Evid. 902(10). Note that this subsection addresses authentication

of the order, not authentication of copies. 

### (f) Distribution.

This subsection is based on paragraph 90 _d_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). The matters in paragraph 96 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) are deleted.

These are administrative matters better left to service regulations. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(2) was amended to clarify that actions

taken subsequent to the initial action may also comprise the supplementary

order. Section (c) was amended to simplify and shorten court-martial orders. _

See_ revisions to Appendix 17. 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER XII. APPEALS AND REVIEW

## Rule 1201. Action by the Judge Advocate General

### (a) Cases required to be referred to a Court of Criminal Appeals.

This subsection is based on Article 66(b). 

### (b) Cases reviewed by the Judge Advocate General.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 69(a). Subsection (2) is based

on Article 64(b)(3) and Article 69(b). Subsection (3) is based on Article

69(b). Subsection (4) is based on Article 69(c). Subsection (b) is similar

to paragraph 103 and the first two paragraphs of paragraph 110A of MCM, 1969

 (Rev.) except insofar as the amendments of Articles 61, 64, and 69 dictate

 otherwise. _See_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No.

 98-209, &sect;&sect; 4(b), 7(a), (e), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The last paragraph

 of paragraph 110A of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was deleted as unnecessary. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(3)(A) was changed to conform to the

language of Article 69(b), as enacted by the Military Justice Act of 1983,

which precludes review of cases previously reviewed under Article 69(a). 

 _

1990 Amendment:_ The discussion to subsection (b)(3)(A) was amended

in conjunction with the implementation of Article 50 _a_,

UCMJ (Military Justice Amendments of 1986, tit. VIII, &sect; 802, National

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub. L. 99-661, 100

Stat. 3905 (1986)). To find an accused not guilty only by reason of lack

of mental responsibility, the fact-finder made a determination that the accused

was guilty of the elements of the offense charged or of a lesser included

offense but also determined that, because he lacked mental responsibility

at the time of the offense, he could not be punished for his actions. _

See_ R.C.M. 921(c)(4). Although the finding does not subject the

accused to punishment by court-martial, the underlying finding of guilt is

reviewable under this rule. Review, however, does not extend to the determination

of lack of mental responsibility. Since the accused voluntarily raised the

issue and has the burden of proving lack of mental responsibility by clear

and convincing evidence, he has waived any later review of the propriety

of that determination. 

 _1990 Amendment:_ The date

from which the two year period to file an application under R.C.M. 1201(b)(3)

begins to run was amended to account for cases resulting in a finding of

not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility. Such cases would

not proceed to sentencing but could be the subject of an application under

this rule. As amended, the accused would have two years from the date findings

were announced in which to file an application for review. 

 _

1995 Amendment:_The Discussion accompanying subsection (1) was amended

to conform with the language of Article 69(a), as enacted by the Military

Justice Amendments of 1989, tit. XIII, sec. 1302(a)(2), National Defense

Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Pub. L. No. 101-189,

103 Stat. 1352, 1576 (1989). 

### (c) Remission and suspension.

This subsection is based on Article 74. _See_ _

United States v. Russo_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 352, 29 C.M.R. 168 (1960); _

United States v. Sood_, 42 C.M.R. 635 (A.C.M.R.), _pet. denied,

_ 42 C.M.R. 356 (1970). 

## Rule 1202. Appellate counsel

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 70(a) and paragraph 102 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Duties.

This subsection is based on Article 70(b) and (c). _See

also_ the first two paragraphs of paragraph 102 _b_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The penultimate sentence in the rule is based on the penultimate

sentence in the fourth paragraph of paragraph 102 _b_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The last sentence in the fourth paragraph of paragraph 102 _

b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) is deleted as unnecessary. The last sentence

in the rule is new. It is based on practice in Federal civilian courts. _

See Rapp. v. Van Dusen_, 350 F. 2d 806 (3d Cir. 1965); Fed.R. App.

P.21(b). _See also_ Rule 27, Revised Rules of the Supreme

Court of the United States (Supp. IV 1980); _United States v. Haldeman

_, 599 F.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976), _cert. denied_, 431

U.S. 933 (1977). _See generally_ 9 J. Moore, B. Ward, and J.

 Lucas, Moore's Federal Practice Para. 221.03 (2d ed. 1982). 

 The

first two paragraphs in the discussion modify the third and fourth paragraphs

of paragraph 102 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The Court of Appeals

for the Armed Forces has held that appellate defense counsel is obligated

to assign as error before the Court of Criminal Appeals all arguable issues

unless such issues are, in counsel's professional opinion, clearly frivolous.

In addition, appellate defense counsel must invite the attention of the court

to issues specified by the accused, unless the accused expressly withdraws

such issues, if these are not otherwise assigned as errors. Also, in a petition

for review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, counsel must, in

addition to errors counsel believes have merit, identify issues which the

accused wants raised. _See United States v. Hullum_, 15 M.J.

261 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States v. Knight_, 15 M.J. 195

(C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Grostefon_, 12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.

1982). _See also_ _United States v. Dupas_,

14 M.J. 28 (C.M.A. 1982); _ United States v. Rainey_, 13 M.J.

462, 463 n. 1 (C.M.A. 1982) (Everett, C.J., dissenting). _But see

Jones v. Barnes_, 463 U.S. 745 (1983) (no constitutional requirement

for appointed counsel to raise every nonfrivolous issue requested by client).

The third paragraph in the discussion is based on Article 70(d) and paragraph

102 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The fourth paragraph in the discussion is based

on the establishment of review by the Supreme Court of certain decisions

of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. _See_ Article

67(h) and 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1259; Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No.

98-209, &sect; 10, 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The fifth paragraph in the

discussion is based on _United States v. Patterson_, 22 U.S.C.M.A.

157, 46 C.M.R. 157 (1973). _See also_ _United States

v. Kelker_, 4 M.J. 323 (C.M.A. 1978); _ United States v. Bell

_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 306, 29 C.M.R. 122 (1960). 

## Rule 1203. Review by a Court of Criminal Appeals

### (a) In general.

This subsection is based on Article 66(a). The discussion is based

on Article 66(a), (f), (g), and (h). _See also_ the first paragraph

 of paragraph 100 _a_ and paragraph 100 _d_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals.

This subsection is based on Article 66(b) and the third sentence

of Article 69(a). Interlocutory appeals by the Government are treated in

R.C.M. 908. The third through the fifth paragraphs in the discussion are

based on Articles 59 and 66(c) and (d) and are taken from the second and

third paragraphs of paragraph 100 _a_ and the first paragraph

of paragraph 100 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also

_ _United States v. Darville_, 5 M.J. 1 (C.M.A. 1978).

The last sentence in the first paragraph is based on _United States

v. Brownd_, 6 M.J. 338 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Yoakum

_, 8 M.J. 763 (A.C.M.R.), _aff'd,_ 9 M.J. 417 (C.M.A.

1980). _See also_ _Corley v. Thurman_, 3 M.J.

192 (C.M.A. 1977). The sixth paragraph in the discussion is based on _

Dettinger v. United States_, 7 M.J. 216 (C.M.A. 1979); 28 U.S.C.

&sect; 1651(a). _See also_ _United States v. LaBella

_, 15 M.J. 228 (C.M.A. 1983);_ United States v. Caprio_,

12 M.J. 30 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Redding_, 11 M.J.

100 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States v. Bogan_, 13 M.J. 768 (A.C.M.R.

1982). The establishment of a statutory right of the Government to appeal

certain rulings at trial might affect some of these precedents. _

See United States v. Weinstein_, 411 F.2d 622 (2d. Cir. 1975),_

cert. denied_, 422 U.S. 1042 (1976). 

### (c) Action on cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 67(b)(2). _See also_

paragraph 100 _b_(2) and the first sentence of paragraph 100 _

c_(1)(a) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _

United States v. Leslie_, 11 M.J. 131 (C.M.A. 1981); _ United

States v. Clay_, 10 M.J. 269 (C.M.A. 1981). 

 Subsection

(2) is based on Article 66(e). _See also__United States

v. Best_, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 581, 16 C.M.R. 155 (1954). The discussion

is consistent with paragraph 100 _b_(3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(3) modifies paragraph 100 _c_(1)(a) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

It allows each service to prescribe specific procedures for service of Court

of Criminal Appeals decisions appropriate to its own organization and needs,

in accordance with the increased flexibility allowed under the amendment

of Article 67(c). _See_ Military Justice Amendments of 1981,

Pub.L. 97-81, 95 Stat. 1090. 

 Subsection (4) is based on

the first paragraph of paragraph 105 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

See also_ Article 74. 

Because R.C.M. 1203 is organized somewhat

differently than paragraph 100 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), the actions described

in subsection (c) of this rule apply to cases referred by the Judge Advocate

General to the Court of Criminal Appeals under Article 69 as well as Article

66. The actions described are appropriate for both types of cases, to the

extent that they are applicable. 

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subsection

5 is based on the second paragraph of paragraph 124 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The fourth sentence is based, in part, on _United States v. Williams

_, 18 M.J. 533 (A.F.C.M.R. 1984). _See also_ _

United States v. Korzeniewski_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 314, 22 C.M.R.104(1956); _

United States v. Bledsoe_, 16 M.J. 977 (A.F.C.M.R. 1983). The provision

assigning the burden of proof is consistent with amendments to R.C.M. 909(c)(2)

and R.C.M. 916(k)(3)(A) which shifted to the defense the burden of showing

lack of mental capacity to stand trial and lack of mental responsibility. 

 _

1998 Amendment:_ The change to the rule implements the creation of

Article 57a, UCMJ, contained in section 1123 of the National Defense Authorization

Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186, 463-64 (1996).

 A sentence to confinement may be deferred by the Secretary concerned when

it has been set aside by a Court of Criminal Appeals and a Judge Advocate

General certifies the case to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for

further review under Article 67(a)(2). Unless it can be shown that the accused

is a flight risk or a potential threat to the community, the accused should

be released from confinement pending the appeal. _See Moore v. Akins

_, 30 M.J. 249 (C.M.A. 1990). 

### (d) Notification to accused.

 This subsection is based on Article 67(c) (as amended, _

 see_ Military Justice Amendments of 1981, Pub.L. 97-81, &sect;

5, 95 Stat. 1088-89) and on the first paragraph of paragraph 100 _

c_ (1)(a) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) (_see_ Exec. Order No.

12340 (Jan. 20, 1982)). The discussion is based on Article 67(b) and on the

second paragraph of paragraph 100 _c_(1)(a) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

### (e) Cases not reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

Subsection (1) is based on the first sentence of paragraph 100 _

c_(1)(b) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See_ Article 71(b).

Subsection (2) is based on the last sentence of paragraph 100c(1)(a) of MCM,

1969 Rev.). _See_ Article 66(e). 

### (f) Scope.

This subsection clarifies that the procedures for Government appeals

 of interlocutory rulings at trial are governed by R.C.M. 908. 

## Rule 1204. Review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

### (a) Cases reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

This subsection is based on the ninth sentence of Article 67(a)(1),

 on Article 67(b), and on the second sentence in Article 69. It generally

 repeats the first paragraph of paragraph 101 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) except insofar

 as that paragraph provided for mandatory review by the Court of Appeals for

the Armed Forces of cases affecting general and flag officers. _See

_ Article 67(b)(1), as amended by the Military Justice Act of 1983,

Pub.L. No. 98-209, &sect; 7(d), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). The first paragraph

in the discussion is based on Article 67(a), (d), and (e), which were repeated

in the second and third paragraphs of paragraph 101 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The second paragraph in the discussion is based on _United States

v. Frischholz_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 150, 36 C.M.R. 306 (1966); 28 U.S.C.

&sect; 1651(a). _See also_ _Noyd v. Bond_,

17 U.S.C.M.A. 40, 37 C.M.R. 304 (1967). 

### (b) Petition by the accused for review by the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces.

Subsection (1) is based on the last paragraph of paragraph 102 _

b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note that if the case reached the Court of

Criminal Appeals by an appeal by the Government under R.C.M. 908, the accused

would already have detailed defense counsel. Subsection (2) is based on C.M.A.R.

19(a)(3). 

### (c) Action on decision by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

Subsection (1) substantially repeats Article 67(f) as did its predecessor,

the fourth paragraph of paragraph 101 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) except that paragraph

did not address possible review by the Supreme Court. _ See_ Article

67(h); 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1259. Subsections (2) and (3) are based on Article

71(a) and (b) and on the last paragraph of paragraph 101 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Subsection (4) is new and reflects the possibility of review by the Supreme

Court. _See_ Article 67(h); 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1259. _

See also_ Article 71. 

## Rule 1205. Review by the Supreme Court

This rule is new and is based on Article 67(h); 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;

1259, 2101. _See_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No.

98-209, &sect; 10, 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). 

## Rule 1206. Powers and responsibilities of the Secretary

### (a) Sentences requiring approval by the Secretary.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of Article 71(b).

### (b) Remission and suspension.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 74(a). Subsection (2) is based

on Article 74(b). Subsection (3) is based on the second paragraph of paragraph

105 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See_ Exec. Order

No. 10498 (Nov. 4, 1953), 18 Fed.Reg. 7003. The reference in paragraph 105 _

 a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) to Secretarial authority to commute sentences

in deleted here as unnecessary. _See_ Article 71(b). 

## Rule 1207. Sentences requiring approval by the President

This rule is based on the first sentence of Article 71(a). Paragraph

 105 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which stated the President's

power to commute sentences, is deleted. Such a statement is unnecessary. _

See also_ U.S. Const. art. II, &sect; 2, cl. 1; _Schick v.

 Reed_, 419 U.S. 256 (1974). 

## Rule 1208. Restoration

 _Introduction._ This rule is based on Article 75.

### (a) New trial.

This subsection is based on paragraph 110 _d_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It has been modified based on the modification of the procedure

 for executing sentences in new trials. _See_ Analysis, R.C.M.

 1209. The last two paragraphs in paragraph 110 _d_ are omitted

 here. They repeated Article 75(b) and (c), which are referred to in the

discussion. 

### (b) Other cases.

This subsection is based on paragraph 106 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

## Rule 1209. Finality of courts-martial

### (a) When a conviction is final.

This subsection is based on Article 71(c), as amended, _

 see_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209, &sect;

 5(e)(1), 97 Stat. 1393 (1983). _See also_ Article 64. Note

that subsection (2)(B) qualifies (2)(A) even if the officer exercising general

 court-martial jurisdiction over the accused (or that officer's successor)

 approves the findings and sentence, the conviction is not final if review

by the Judge Advocate General is required. _See_ Article 64(c)(3);

 R.C.M. 1201(b)(2). As to the finality of an acquittal or disposition not

 amounting to findings of guilty, _see_ Article 44; R.C.M.

 905(g). _See also_ _Grafton v. United States_,

206U.S. 333 (1907). 

### (b) Effect of finality.

This subsection is taken from Article 76 and paragraph 108 of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Article 69(b). 

## Rule 1210. New trial

This rule is based on Article 73 and is based on paragraphs 109

and 110 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Some matters in those paragraphs (_e.g.,

_ paragraphs 110 _a_(2) and 109 _d_)

 are covered in other rules. _See_ R.C.M. 810; 1209. The second

 sentence of paragraph 109 _d_(1) has been deleted as unnecessary

 and potentially confusing. Subsections (f)(2) and (3) adequately describe

the standards for a new trial. The rule is generally consistent with Fed. R. Crim. P. 33, except insofar as Article 73 provides otherwise. As to subsection

(f), _see also_ _United States v. Bacon_, 12

M.J. 489 (C.M.A. 1982); _ United States v. Thomas_, 11 M.J.

135 (C.M.A. 1981). With respect to the second example under subsection (f)(3)

of this rule, it should be noted that if the information concealed by the

prosecution was specifically requested by the defense, a different standard

may apply. _See United States v. Agurs_, 427 U.S. 97 (1976); _

Brady v. Maryland_, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). _See also_ _

United States v. Horsey_, 6 M.J. 112 (C.M.A. 1979). The second sentence

of paragraph 110 _f_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) has been deleted. _

See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 1107(f)(3)(D)(i). 

 Subsections (h)(3),

(4), and (5) have been modified to permit the convening authority of a new

trial to take action in the same way as in a rehearing; i.e., the convening

authority may, when otherwise authorized to do so (see R.C.M. 1113), order

the sentence executed. Forwarding a new trial to the Judge Advocate General

is not required just because the case was a new trial. The special circumstances

of a new trial do not necessitate such different treatment in post-trial

action. 

 _1998 Amendment:_ R.C.M. 1210(a) was amended

to clarify its application consistent with interpretations of Fed. R. Crim.

P. 33 that newly discovered evidence is never a basis for a new trial of

the facts when the accused has pled guilty. _See United States v.

Lambert_ , 603 F.2d 808, 809 (10th Cir. 1979); _see also United

States v. Gordon_, 4 F.3d 1567, 1572 n.3 (10th Cir. 1993), _

cert. denied_, 510 U.S. 1184 (1994); _United States v. Collins

_ , 898 F.2d 103 (9th Cir. 1990)(per curiam); _United States

v. Prince_, 533 F.2d 205 (5th Cir. 1976); _Williams v. United

 States_, 290 F.2d 217 (5th Cir. 1961). _But see United States

v. Brown_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 207, 211, 29 C.M.R. 23, 27 (1960)(per Latimer,

J.)(newly discovered evidence could be used to attack guilty plea on appeal

in era prior to the guilty plea examination mandated by _United States

v. Care_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 535, 40 C.M.R. 247 (1969) and R.C.M. 910(e)).

 Article 73 authorizes a petition for a new trial of the facts when there

has been a trial. When there is a guilty plea, there is no trial. See R.C.M.

910(j). The amendment is made in recognition of the fact that it is difficult,

if not impossible, to determine whether newly discovered evidence would have

an impact on the trier of fact when there has been no trier of fact and no

previous trial of the facts at which other pertinent evidence has been adduced.

 Additionally, a new trial may not be granted on the basis of newly discovered

evidence unless "[t]he newly discovered evidence,

if considered by a court-martial in the light of all other pertinent evidence,

would probably produce a substantially more favorable result for the accused."

 R.C.M. 1210(f)(2)(C). 

# CHAPTER CHAPTER XIII. SUMMARY COURTS-MARTIAL

## Rule 1301. Summary courts-martial generally

### (a) Composition.

The first sentence is based on Article 16(3). In the second sentence

 the express authority for the Secretary concerned to provide for the summary

 court-martial to be from a different service than the accused is new. Paragraph

 4 _g_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) included this statement: "However,

a summary court-martial will be a member of the same armed force as the accused."

The fact that this statement was included in a subparagraph entitled "Joint

command or joint task force" left unclear what rule applied in other

commands. The Working Group elected to clarify the situation by stating a

general prohibition against detailing a summary court-martial from a service

different from that of the accused, but allowing the service Secretaries

to provide exceptions. This is based on the desirability of having the summary

court-martial be from the same service as the accused, but recognizes that

under some circumstances, as where a small unit of one service is collocated

with another service, greater flexibility is needed, especially in order

to comply with the policy in the third sentence of this subsection. The expression

of policy in the third sentence is based on paragraph 4 _c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The fourth sentence is based on Article 24(b) and the fifth

sentence of the first paragraph of paragraph 5 _c_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The last sentence is based on the last sentence of the first

paragraph of paragraph 5 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), but has

been modified to clarify that the summary court-martial may be from outside

the command of the summary court-martial convening authority.

 _2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (a) was amended to clarify that summary courts-martial convened by a combatant or joint commander are to be conducted in accordance with the implementing regulations and procedures of the service of which the accused is a member.

### (b) Function.

This subsection is based on paragraph 79 _a_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). The rule does not restrict other lawful functions which a summary

 court-martial may perform under the Code. _See, e.g.,_ Article

 136. A summary court-martial appointed to dispose of decedent's effects under

 10 U.S.C. &sect; 4712 or 10 U.S.C. &sect; 9712 is not affected by these rules.

 _See also_ R.C.M. 101 and 201(a). 

### (c) Jurisdiction.

This subsection is based on the first sentence of Article 20 and

the first sentence of paragraph 16 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The reference to Chapter II was added to bring attention to other jurisdictional

 standards which may apply to summary courts-martial.

 _2015 Amendment_: This subsection was revised to implement Section 1705 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, and applies to offenses occurring on or after 24 June 2014.

### (d) Punishments.

This subsection is based on paragraph 16 _b_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.), and Article 20. 

### (e) Counsel.

The code does not provide a right to counsel at a summary court-martial

(Articles 27 and 38.). The Supreme Court of the United States held in _

Middendorf v. Henry_, 425 U.S. 25 (1976), that an accused is not

entitled to counsel in summary courts-martial, and that confinement may be

adjudged notwithstanding the failure to provide the accused with counsel.

In so holding, the Court distinguished summary courts-martial from civilian

criminal proceedings at which counsel is required. _See Argersigner

v. Hamlin_, 407 U.S. 25 (1972). Although the issue in _Middendorf

v. Henry, supra_, was whether counsel must be provided to an accused

at a summary court-martial, the Court's opinion clearly indicates that there

is no right to any counsel (including retained counsel) at summary courts-martial.

It is within the discretion of the convening authority to detail, or otherwise

make available, a military attorney to represent the accused at a summary

court-martial. 

 This rule does not provide a right to consult with

counsel prior to a summary court-martial. There is no constitutional or statutory

basis for such a right. _United States v. Mack_, 9 M.J. 300,

320-21 (C.M.A. 1980). A requirement for such consultation, although desirable

under some circumstances, is unfeasible under others wherein it impedes the

purposes of summary courts-martial by significantly delaying the proceedings.

At present, the admissibility of a summary court-martial without a prior

 opportunity to consult with counsel in subsequent courts-martial has not

been fully resolved. _United States v. Mack, supra; United States

v. Booker_, 5 M.J. 238 (C.M.A. 1977). _See United States v.

 Kuehl_, 11 M.J. 126 (C.M.A. 1981). 

### (f) Power to obtain witnesses and evidence.

This subsection is based on Article 46 and 47 and paragraphs 79

 _b_ and 115 of the MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (g) Secretarial limitations.

This subsection is new and recognizes the implicit authority of

the service secretaries to provide additional rules, such as those governing

the exercise of summary court-martial jurisdiction. 

## Rule 1302. Convening a summary court-martial

### (a) Who may convene summary courts-martial.

This subsection is based on Article 24(a) and paragraph 5 _

 c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) When convening authority is the accuser.

This subsection is based on the second paragraph of paragraph 5

 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (c) Procedure.

This subsection clarifies that a separate written order is not

necessary to convene a summary court-martial; this may be done directly on

the charge sheet. Because there is little difference between summary, special,

and general courts-martial with respect to the initiation and forwarding

of charges, these procedures are simply referred to in the rule. 

## Rule 1303. Right to object to trial by summary court-martial

This rule is based on Article 20 and the second and third sentences

 of paragraph 16 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Arraignment ends

the right to object because arraignment is the point at which the accused

is "brought to trial" within the meaning of Article 20. 

## Rule 1304. Trial procedure

### (a) Pretrial duties.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 79 _c_ and

33 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Summary court-martial procedure.

Paragraph 79 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), suggested that

 the summary court-martial use the general court-martial trial guide. However,

 the general court-martial trial guide is inadequate for the person who ordinarily

conducts the summary court-martial. The trial guide in Appendix 9 of this

Manual was drafted to assist the lay presiding officer at summary courts-martial

and incorporate the rules prescribed in this chapter. 

 Subsection

(1) is based on paragraph 79 _d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

requirement to inform the accused of the date of referral was added to subsection

(1)(B) to assist the accused in making motions to dismiss or for other relief.

Subsection (1)(E) is intended to more fully inform the accused of the scope

of the evidence (testimonial, documentary, and physical) expected to be introduced.

Subsection (1)(F) is new and is designed to assist the accused in making

motions and presenting evidence in defense and in extenuation and mitigation.

Subsection (1)(G) is new and is designed to assure the accused that no evidence,

including statements previously made to the officer detailed to conduct the

summary court-martial, will be considered unless admitted in accordance with

the Military Rules of Evidence. Subsection (1)(H) is new. Subsection (1)(L)

is expanded to assure the accused that the exercise of rights guaranteed

under the Fifth Amendment and Article 31 will not be held against the accused. 

 Subsection

(2)(A) is based on Article 20 and the second paragraph of paragraph 79 _

d_(1) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection (2)(B) is based

on paragraph 79 _d_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsection

(2)(C) is new. MCM, 1969 (Rev.) did not clarify the timing of motions in

summary courts-martial. 

 Subsection (2)(D)(ii) is new and designed

to standardize the guilty plea inquiry by referring the summary court-martial

to R.C.M. 909 which prescribed the inquiry for summary, special, and general

courts-martial. Subsections (2)(D)(i) and (iii) through (v) are based on

paragraph 79 _ d_(2) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The provision in

paragraph 79 _ d_(2) which provided for hearing evidence on

the offense(s) in a guilty plea case is omitted here because this procedure

is covered in R.C.M. 1001(b)(4). 

 Subsection (2)(E)(i) is based

on Mil. R. Evid. 101 and 1101. Subsections (2)(E)(ii) through (iv) are based

on paragraph 79 _d_ (3) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Subsections

(2)(F)(i) through (iii) are based on paragraph 79 _d_(4) of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note that the summary court-martial may consider otherwise

admissible records from the accused's personnel file under R.C.M. 1001(b)(2).

This was not permitted under MCM, 1969 (Rev.) before the amendment of paragraph

75 on 1 August 1981. _See_ Exec. Order No. 12315 (July 29,

1981). Subsection (2)(F)(iv) is new and fulfills the summary court-martial's

post-trial responsibility to protect the interests of the accused by informing

the accused of post-trial rights. 

 Subsection (2)(F)(v) is new

and designed to inform the convening authority of any suspension recommendation

and deferment request before receipt of the record of trial. Subsection (2)(F)(vi)

modifies paragraph 79 _ d_(4) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It recognizes

the custodial responsibility of the summary court-martial over an accused

sentenced to confinement until the accused is delivered to the commander

or the commander's designee. It does not address the subsequent disposition

of the accused, as this is a prerogative of the commander. 

## Rule 1305. Record of trial

### (a) In general.

This rule is based on paragraphs 79 _e_ and 91 _

 c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) insofar as they prescribed that the record

of trial of a summary court-martial will consist of a notation of key events

at trial and insofar as they permitted the convening or higher authority

to require additional matters in the record. Additional requirements may

be established by the Secretary concerned, the convening authority, or other

 competent authority. The modification of the format of the charge sheet

(_see_ Appendix 4) eliminated it as the form for the record

of trial of a summary court-martial. A separate format is now provided at

Appendix 15. 

### (b) Contents.

This subsection is based on paragraphs 79 _e_ and

 91_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ R.C.M. 1305(b)(2) was amended to delete the requirement that the

record of trial in summary courts-martial reflect the number of previous

convictions considered. The Committee concluded that this requirement had

only slight utility and also noted that DD Form 2329, which serves as the

record of trial in summary courts-martial, has no entry for this information.

The Committee also noted that the Services each have requirements for retaining

documents introduced at summary courts-martial with the record of trial.

 _2008 Amendment_. Section (b) was amended by changing the first sentence to no longer require the preparation of copies of the record of trial, mandating instead that the summary court-martial prepare a "written record of trial."  This amendment was made in conjunction with the addition of the definition of the word "writing" in R.C.M. 103(20).

### (c) Authentication.

This subsection is based on paragraph 79 _e_ of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ This subsection

was amended to require that summary courts-martial authenticate the original

record of trial, as is currently the procedure for special and general courts-martial.

 _2008 Amendment_. Section (c) was amended to conform to the new authentication requirements outlined in RCM 1104. Pursuant to this change, the summary court-martial may authenticate a record of trial by electronic signature.

### (d) Forwarding copies of the record.

Subsection (1) is based on Article 60(b)(2). Subsection (2) is based

 on the third paragraph of paragraph 91_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 Subsection (3) is self-explanatory.

 _2008 Amendment_. Subsection (d)(1)(A) was amended to conform to the changes set forth in RCM 1104 by allowing a summary court-martial to effectuate service by sending a record of trial electronically.

 _2001 Amendment:_ Subsection

(d)(2) was amended to strike the reference to "subsection (e)(1)"

and insert a reference to "subsection (d)(1)" to reflect the

1995 amendment that redesignated R.C.M. 1305(e) as R.C.M. 1305(d). 

## Rule 1306. Post-trial procedure

### (a) Accused's post-trial petition.

This subsection is based on Article 60(b)._Cf._

Article 38(c). 

### (b) Convening authority's action.

Subsection (1) refers to the detailed provisions concerning the

 convening authority's initial review and action in R.C.M. 1107. The time

period is based on Article 60(b)(1). Subsections (2) through (4) are based

on paragraph 90 _e_ of the MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subsection (2)

is modified to reflect that the accused ordinarily will receive a copy of

the record before action is taken. _See_ Article 60(b)(2). 

_

 2004 Amendment:_ The cross-reference to subsection R.C.M. 1105(c)(3)

is amended to R.C.M. 1105(c)(2) to conform to the 1987 Change 3 amendment

that re-designated R.C.M. 1105(c)(3) as R.C.M. 1105(c)(2).

_ 2008 Amendment_. Subsection (b)(3) was amended to conform to RCM 1104, by allowing a convening authority to sign an action dealing with an electronic record of trial electronically.

### (c) Review by a judge advocate.

This subsection is based on Article 64. 

### (d) Review by the Judge Advocate General.

This subsection is based on Article 69 and refers to the detailed

 provisions governing such requests for review in R.C.M. 1201. 

# ANALYSIS OF THE MILITARY RULES OF EVIDENCE

 The Military Rules of Evidence, promulgated in 1980 as

Chapter XXVII of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Rev.

ed.), were the product of a two year effort participated in by the General

Counsel of the Department of Defense, the United States Court of Military

Appeals, the Military Departments, and the Department of Transportation

(the Department under which the Coast Guard was operating at that time).

The Rules were drafted by the Evidence Working Group of the Joint Service

Committee on Military Justice, which consisted of Commander James Pinnell,

JAGC, U.S. Navy, then Major John Bozeman, JAGC, U.S. Army (from April 1978

until July 1978), Major Fredric Lederer, JAGC, U.S. Army (from August 1978),

Major James Potuk, U.S. Air Force, Lieutenant Commander Tom Snook, U.S. Coast

Guard, and Mr. Robert Mueller and Ms. Carol Wild Scott of the United States

Court of Military Appeals. Mr. Andrew Effron represented the Office of the

General Counsel of the Department of Defense on the Committee. The draft

rules were reviewed and, as modified, approved by the Joint Service Committee

on Military Justice. Aspects of the Rules were reviewed by the Code Committee

as well. _See_ Article 67(g). The Rules were approved by the

General Counsel of the Department of Defense and forwarded to the White House

via the Office of Management and Budget which circulated the Rules to the

Departments of Justice and Transportation.

 The original Analysis was prepared primarily by Major Fredric Lederer, U.S. Army, of the Evidence Working Group of the Joint Service Committee on Military Justice and was

approved by the Joint Service Committee on Military Justice and reviewed

in the Office of the General Counsel of the Department of Defense. The Analysis

presents the intent of the drafting committee; seeks to indicate the source

of the various changes to the Manual, and generally notes when substantial

changes to military law result from the amendments. This Analysis is not,

however, part of the Executive Order modifying the present Manual nor does

it constitute the official views of the Department of Defense, the Department

of Homeland Security, the Military Departments, or of the United States Court

of Military Appeals.

 The Analysis does not identify technical

changes made to adapt the Federal Rules of Evidence to military use. Accordingly,

the Analysis does not identify changes made to make the Rules gender neutral

or to adapt the Federal Rules to military terminology by substituting, for

example, "court members" for "jury" and "military

judge" for "court." References within the Analysis to "the

1969 Manual" and "MCM, 1969 (Rev.)" refer to the Manual

for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev. ed.) (Executive Order 11,476, as amended by

 Executive Order 11,835 and Executive Order 12,018) as it existed prior to

the effective date of the 1980 amendments. References to "the prior

 law" and "the prior rule" refer to the state of the law

as it existed prior to the effective date of the 1980 amendments. References

to the "Federal Rules of Evidence Advisory Committee" refer to

the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Evidence appointed by the Supreme

Court, which prepared the original draft of the Federal Rules of Evidence. 

 During

the Manual revision project that culminated in promulgation of the Manual

for Courts-Martial, 1984 (Executive Order 12473), several changes were made

in the Military Rules of Evidence, and the analysis of those changes was

placed in Appendix 21. Thus, it was intended that this Appendix would remain

static. In 1985, however, it was decided that changes in the analysis of

the Military Rules of Evidence would be incorporated into this Appendix as

 those changes are made so that the reader need consult only one document

to determine the drafters' intent regarding the current rules. Changes are

made to the Analysis only when a rule is amended. Changes to the Analysis

are clearly marked, but the original Analysis is not changed. Consequently,

the Analysis of some rules contains analysis of language subsequently deleted

or amended. 

 In addition, because this Analysis expresses the intent

of the drafters, certain legal doctrines stated in this Analysis may have

been overturned by subsequent case law. This Analysis does not substitute

for research about current legal rules. 

 Several changes were

made for uniformity of style with the remainder of the Manual. Only the first

word in the title of a rule is capitalized. The word "rule" when

used in text to refer to another rule, was changed to "Mil. R. Evid."

to avoid confusion with the Rules for Courts-Martial. "Code"

is used in place of Uniform Code of Military Justice. "Commander"

is substituted for "commanding officer" and "officer in

charge." _ See_ R.C.M. 103(5). Citations to the United

States Code were changed to conform to the style used elsewhere. "Government"

is capitalized when used as a noun to refer to the United States Government.

In addition, several cross-references to paragraphs in MCM, 1969 (Rev.) were

changed to indicate appropriate provisions in this Manual. 

 With

these exceptions, however, the Military Rules of Evidence were not redrafted.

Consequently, there are minor variations in style or terminology between

the Military Rules of Evidence and other parts of the Manual. Where the same

subject is treated in similar but not identical terms in the Military Rules

of Evidence and elsewhere, a different meaning or purpose should not be inferred

in the absence of a clear indication in the text or the analysis that this

was intended.

 _2013 Amendment._ On December 1, 2011, the Federal Rules of Evidence (Fed. R. Evid.) were amended by restyling the rules to make them simpler to understand and use, without changing the substantive meaning of any rule.

 After considering these changes to the Federal Rules, the  committee  recommended significant changes to the Military Rules of Evidence (Mil. R. Evid.) in 2012. This rewrite was implemented by Executive Order 13643 of May 15, 2013. In addition to recommending stylistic changes to harmonize these rules with the Federal Rules, the committee also recommended changes to ensure that the rules addressed the admissibility of evidence, rather than the conduct of the individual actors. Like the Federal Rules of Evidence, these rules ultimately dictate whether evidence is admissible and, therefore, it is appropriate to phrase the rules with admissibility as the focus, rather than a focus on the actor (i.e., the commanding officer, military judge, accused, etc.).

 The rules were also reformatted to achieve clearer presentation. The committee recommended use of indented paragraphs with headings and hanging indents to allow the practitioner to distinguish between different subsections of the rules. The restyled rules also reduce the use of inconsistent terms that are intended to mean the same thing but may, because of the inconsistent use, be misconstrued by the practitioner to mean something different.

 With most of its recommended changes, the committee made special effort to avoid any style improvement that might result in a substantive change in the application of the rule. However, in some rules, the committee recommended rewriting the rule with the express purpose to change the substantive content of the rule in order to affect the application of the rule in practice. In the analysis of each rule, the committee clearly indicates whether the changes are intended to be substantive or merely stylistic. The reader is encouraged to consult the analysis of each rule if he or she has questions as to whether the committee intended that a change to the rule have an effect on a ruling of admissibility.

# General Provisions

## Rule 101. Scope

### (a) Applicability.

Rule 101(a) is taken generally from Federal Rule of Evidence 101.

It emphasizes that these Rules are applicable to summary as well as to special

and general courts-martial. _See_ "Rule of Construction."

Rule 101(c), _infra._ Rule 1101 expressly indicates that the

rules of evidence are inapplicable to investigative hearings under Article

32, proceedings for pretrial advice, search authorization proceedings, vacation

proceedings, and certain other proceedings. Although the Rules apply to sentencing,

they may be "relaxed" under Rule 1101(c) and R.C.M. 1001(c)(3). 

 The

limitation in subdivision (a) applying the Rules to courts-martial is intended

expressly to recognize that these Rules are not applicable to military commissions,

provost courts, and courts of inquiry unless otherwise required by competent

authority. _See_ Part I, Para. 2 of the Manual. The Rules,

however, serve as a "guide" for such tribunals. _Id._ 

 The

Military Rules of Evidence are inapplicable to proceedings conducted pursuant

to Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 

 The decisions

of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and of the Courts

of Criminal Appeals must be utilized in interpreting these Rules. While specific

decisions of the Article III courts involving rules which are common both

to the Military Rules and the Federal Rules should be considered very persuasive,

they are not binding; _see_ Article 36 of the Uniform Code

of Military Justice. It should be noted, however, that a significant policy

consideration in adopting the Federal Rules of Evidence was to ensure, where

possible, common evidentiary law. 

### (b) Secondary sources.

Rule 101(b) is taken from Para. 137 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) which had

its origins in Article 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Rule 101(a)

 makes it clear that the Military Rules of Evidence are the primary source

of evidentiary law for military practice. Notwithstanding their wide scope,

 however, Rule 101(b) recognizes that recourse to secondary sources may occasionally

be necessary. Rule 101(b) prescribes the sequence in which such sources shall

be utilized. 

 Rule 101(b)(1) requires that the first such source

be the "rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal

cases in the United States District courts." To the extent that a Military

Rule of Evidence reflects an express modification of a Federal Rule of Evidence

or a federal evidentiary procedure, the President has determined that the

unmodified Federal Rule or procedure is, within the meaning of Article 36(a),

either not "practicable" or is "contrary to or inconsistent

with" the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Consequently, to the extent

to which the Military Rules do not dispose of an issue, the Article III Federal

practice when practicable and not inconsistent or contrary to the Military

Rules shall be applied. In determining whether there is a rule of evidence

"generally recognized," it is anticipated that ordinary legal

research shall be involved with primary emphasis being placed upon the published

decisions of the three levels of the Article III courts. 

 Under

Rule 1102, which concerns amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence, no

amendment to the Federal Rules shall be applicable to courts-martial until

180 days after the amendment's effective date unless the President shall

direct its earlier adoption. Thus, such an amendment cannot be utilized as

a secondary source until 180 days has passed since its effective date or

until the President had directed its adoption, whichever occurs first. An

amendment will not be applicable at any time if the President so directs. 

 It

is the intent of the Committee that the expression, "common law"

found within Rule 101(b)(2) be construed in its broadest possible sense.

It should include the federal common law and what may be denominated military

common law. Prior military cases may be cited as authority under Rule 101(b)(2)

to the extent that they are based upon a present Manual provision which has

been retained in the Military Rules of Evidence or to the extent that they

are not inconsistent with the "rules of evidence generally recognized

in the trial of criminal cases in the United States District courts,"

deal with matters "not otherwise prescribed in this Manual or these

rules," and are "practicable and not inconsistent with or contrary

to the Uniform Code of Military justice or this Manual." 

### (c) Rule of construction.

Rule 101(c) is intended to avoid unnecessary repetition of the

expressions, "president of a special court-martial without a military

 judge" and "summary court-martial officer." "Summary

 court-martial officer" is used instead of "summary court-martial"

for purposes of clarity. A summary court-martial is considered to function

in the same role as a military judge notwithstanding possible lack of legal

training. As previously noted in Para. 137, MCM, 1969 (Rev.), "a summary

court-martial has the same discretionary power as a military judge concerning

the reception of evidence." Where the application of these Rules in

a summary court-martial or a special court-martial without a military judge

is different from the application of the Rules in a court-martial with a

military judge, specific reference has been made.

_Disposition of present Manual._ That part of Para. 137, MCM, 1969 (Rev.), not

reflected in Rule 101 is found in other rules, _see, e.g.,_ Rules

104, 401, 403. The reference in Para. 137 to privileges arising out of treaty

or executive agreement was deleted as being unnecessary. _See generally

_ Rule 501.

 _2013 Amendment._ In subsection (a), the phrase "including summary courts-martial" was removed because Rule 1101 already addresses the applicability of these rules to summary courts-martial. In subsection (b), the word "shall" was changed to "will" in accordance with the approach of the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules to minimize the use of words such as "shall" and "should" because of the potential disparity in application and interpretation of whether the word is precatory or prescriptive. _See_ Fed. R. Evid. 101, Restyled Rules Committee Note. In recommending this change, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 The Discussion section was added to this rule to alert the practitioner that discussion sections, which previously did not appear in Part III of the Manual, are included in this edition to elucidate the committee's understanding of the rules. The discussion sections do not have the force of law and may be changed by the committee without an Executive Order, as warranted by changes in applicable case law. The discussion sections should be considered treatise material and are non-binding on the practitioner.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 102. Purpose and construction

Rule 102 is taken without change from Federal Rule of Evidence 102

 and is without counterpart in MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It provides a set of general

 guidelines to be used in construing the Military Rules of Evidence. It is,

 however, only a rule of construction and not a license to disregard the Rules

 in order to reach a desired result. 

## Rule 103. Rulings on evidence

### (a) Effect of erroneous ruling.

Rule 103(a) is taken from the Federal Rule with a number of changes.

 The first, the use of the language, "the ruling materially prejudices

a substantial right of a party" in place of the Federal Rule's "a

 substantial right of party is affected" is required by Article 59(a)

of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Rule 103(a) comports with present

 military practice. 

 The second significant change is the addition

of material relating to constitutional requirements and explicitly states

that errors of constitutional magnitude may require a higher standard than

the general one required by Rule 103(a). For example, the harmless error

rule, when applicable to an error of constitutional dimensions, prevails

over the general rule of Rule 103(a). Because Section III of these Rules

embodies constitutional rights, two standards of error may be at issue; one

involving the Military Rules of Evidence, and one involving the underlying

constitutional rule. In such a case, the standard of error more advantageous

to the accused will apply. 

 Rule 103(a)(1) requires that a timely

motion or objection generally be made in order to preserve a claim of error.

This is similar to but more specific than prior practice. In making such

a motion or objection, the party has a right to state the specific grounds

of the objection to the evidence. Failure to make a timely and sufficiently

specific objection may waive the objection for purposes of both trial and

appeal. In applying Federal Rule 103(a), the Article III courts have interpreted

the Rule strictly and held the defense to an extremely high level of specificity. _

See_, _e.g., United States v. Rubin_, 609 F.2d 51,

61-63 (2d Cir. 1979) (objection to form of witness's testimony did not raise

or preserve an appropriate hearsay objection); _United States v. O'Brien

_, 601 F.2d 1067 (9th Cir. 1979) (objection that prosecution witness

was testifying from material not in evidence held inadequate to raise or

preserve an objection under Rule 1006). As indicated in the Analysis of Rule

802, Rule 103 significantly changed military law insofar as hearsay is concerned.

Unlike present law under which hearsay is absolutely incompetent, the Military

Rules of Evidence simply treat hearsay as being inadmissible upon adequate

 objection; _see_ Rules 803, 103(a). Note in the context of

Rule 103(a) that R.C.M. 801(a)(3) (Discussion) states: "The parties

are entitled to reasonable opportunity to properly present and support their

 contentions on any relevant matter." 

 An "offer of

proof" is a concise statement by counsel setting forth the substance

of the expected testimony or other evidence. 

 Rule 103(a) prescribes

a standard by which errors will be tested on appeal. Although counsel at

trial need not indicate how an alleged error will "materially prejudice

a substantial right" in order to preserve error, such a showing, during

or after the objection or offer, may be advisable as a matter of trial practice

to further illuminate the issue for both the trial and appellate bench. 

_

 2004 Amendment:_ Subdivision (a)(2) was modified based on the

amendment to Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2), effective 1 December 2000, and is virtually

identical to its Federal Rule counterpart. It is intended to provide that

where an advance ruling is definitive, a party need not renew an objection

or offer of proof at trial; otherwise, renewal is required.

### (b) Record of offer,

 and (c) _Hearing of members_- Rule 103(b)

and (c) are taken from the Federal Rules with minor changes in terminology

to adapt them to military procedure. 

### (d) Plain error-

Rule 103(d) is taken from the Federal Rule with a minor change of

 terminology to adapt it to military practice and the substitution of "materially

prejudices" substantial rights of "affecting" substantial

rights to conform it to Article 59(a) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 104. Preliminary questions

### (a) Questions of admissibility generally.

Rule 104(a) is taken generally from the Federal Rule. Language in

the Federal Rule requiring that admissibility shall be determined by the

 "court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)" has been

 struck to ensure that, subject to Rule 1008, questions of admissibility are

 solely for the military judge and not for the court-members. The deletion

of the language is not intended, however, to negate the general interrelationship

 between subdivisions (a) and (b). When relevancy is conditioned on the fulfillment

of a condition of fact, the military judge shall "admit it upon, or

subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding

of the fulfillment of the condition." 

 Pursuant to language

taken from Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a), the rules of evidence, other

than those with respect to privileges, are inapplicable to "preliminary

questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence

of a privilege, the admissibility of evidence...." These exceptions

are new to military law and may substantially change military practice. The

Federal Rule has been modified, however, by inserting language relating to

applications for continuances and determinations of witness availability.

The change, taken from MCM, 1969 (Rev.), Para. 137, is required by the worldwide

disposition of the armed forces which makes matters relating to continuances

and witness availability particularly difficult, if not impossible, to resolve

under the normal rules of evidence- particularly the hearsay rule. 

 A

significant and unresolved issue stemming from the language of Rule 104(a)

is whether the rules of evidence shall be applicable to evidentiary questions

involving constitutional or statutory issues such as those arising under

Article 31. Thus it is unclear, for example, whether the rules of evidence

are applicable to a determination of the voluntariness of an accused's statement.

While the Rule strongly suggests that rules of evidence are not applicable

to admissibility determinations involving constitutional issues, the issue

is unresolved at present. 

### (b) Relevancy conditioned on fact.

Rule 104(b) is taken from the Federal Rule except that the following

 language had been added: "A ruling on the sufficiency of evidence to

 support a finding of fulfillment of a condition of fact is the sole responsibility

of the military judge." This material was added in order to clarify

the rule and to explicitly preserve contemporary military procedure, Para.

57, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Under the Federal Rule, it is unclear whether and to

what extent evidentiary questions are to be submitted to the jury as questions

of admissibility. Rule 104(b) has thus been clarified to eliminate any possibility,

except as required by Rule 1008, that the court members will make an admissibility

determination. Failure to clarify the rule would produce unnecessary confusion

in the minds of the court members and unnecessarily prolong trials. Accordingly,

adoption of the language of the Federal Rules without modification is impracticable

in the armed forces. 

### (c) Hearing of members.

Rule 104(c) is taken generally from the Federal Rule. Introductory

 material has been added because of the impossibility of conducting a hearing

 out of the presence of the members in a special court-martial without a

military judge. "Statements of an accused" has been used in lieu

of "confessions" because of the phrasing of Article 31 of the

Uniform Code of Military Justice, which has been followed in Rules 301-306.

### (d) Testimony by accused.

Rule 104(d) is taken without change from the Federal Rule. Application

of this rule in specific circumstances is set forth in Rule 304(f), 311(f)

and 321(e). 

### (e) Weight and credibility.

Rule 104(e) is taken without change from the Federal Rule.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 105. Limiting evidence that is not admissible against other parties or for other purposes.

Rule 105 is taken without change from the Federal Rule. In view

of its requirement that the military judge restrict evidence to its proper

scope "upon request," it overrules _United States v.

Grunden_, 2 M.J. 116 (C.M.A. 1977) (holding that the military judge

 must _sua sponte_ instruct the members as to use of evidence

of uncharged misconduct) and related cases insofar as they _require

_ the military judge to _sua sponte_ instruct the

members. _See e.g.,_ S. SALTZBURG & K. REDDEN, _

FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL_ 50 (2d ed. 1977); _United

States v. Sangrey_, 586 F.2d 1315 (9th Cir. 1978); _United

States v. Barnes_, 586 F.2d 1052 (5th Cir. 1978); _United

States v. Bridwell_, 583 F.2d 1135 (10th Cir. 1978); _but

see United States v. Ragghianti_, 560 F.2d 1376 (9th Cir. 1977).

This is compatible with the general intent of both the Federal and Military

Rules in that they place primary if not full responsibility upon counsel

for objecting to or limiting evidence. Note that the Rule 306, dealing with

statements of co-accused, is more restrictive and protective than Rule 105.

The military judge may, of course, choose to instruct _sua sponte

_ but need not do so. Failure to instruct _sua sponte_ could

potentially require a reversal only if such failure could be considered "plain

 error" within the meaning of Rule 103(d). Most failures to instruct_

 sua sponte,_ or to instruct, cannot be so considered in light of

current case law.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 106. Remainder of or related writings or recorded statements

Rule 106 is taken from the Federal Rule without change. In view

of the tendency of fact-finders to give considerable evidentiary weight to

written matters, the Rule is intended to preclude the misleading situation

that can occur if a party presents only part of a writing or recorded statement.

In contrast to Para. 140 _a_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which applies

only to statements by an accused, the new Rule is far more expansive and

permits a party to require the opposing party to introduce evidence. That

aspect of Para. 140 _a_(b) survives as Rule 304(h)(2) and

allows the defense to complete an alleged confession or admission offered

by the prosecution. When a confession or admission is involved, the defense

may employ both Rules 106 and 304(h)(2), as appropriate.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

# Judicial Notice

## Rule 201. Judicial notice of adjudicative facts

### (a) Scope of Rule.

Rule 201(a) provides that Rule 201 governs judicial notice of adjudicative

facts. In so doing, the Rule replaced MCM, 1969 (Rev.), Para. 147 _

a_. The Federal Rules of Evidence Advisory Committee defined adjudicative

facts as "simply the facts of the particular case" and distinguished

them from legislative facts which it defined as "those which have relevance

to legal reasoning and the lawmaking process, whether in the formulation

of a legal principle or ruling by a judge or court or in the enactment of

a legislative body," reprinted in S. SALTZBURG & K. REDDEN, _

FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL_ 63 (2d ed. 1977). The distinction

between the two types of facts, originated by Professor Kenneth Davis, can

on occasion be highly confusing in practice and resort to any of the usual

treatises may be helpful. 

### (b) Kinds of facts.

Rule 201(b) was taken generally from the Federal Rule. The limitation

 with FED. R. EVID. 201(b)(1) to facts known "within the territorial

 jurisdiction of the trial court" was replaced, however, by the expression,

"generally known universally, locally, or in the area, pertinent to

the event." The worldwide disposition of the armed forces rendered

the original language inapplicable and impracticable within the military

environment. Notice of signatures, appropriate under Para. 147 _ a

_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.), will normally be inappropriate under this Rule.

 Rule 902(4) & (10) will, however, usually yield the same result as under

 Para. 147 _a._ 

 When they qualify as adjudicative

facts under Rule 201, the following are examples of matters of which judicial

notice may be taken: 

 The ordinary division of time into years,

months, weeks and other periods; general facts and laws of nature, including

their ordinary operations and effects; general facts of history; generally

known geographical facts; such specific facts and propositions of generalized

knowledge as are so universally known that they cannot reasonably be the

subject of dispute; such facts as are so generally known or are of such common

notoriety in the area in which the trial is held that they cannot reasonably

be the subject of dispute; and specific facts and propositions of generalized

knowledge which are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort

to easily accessible sources of reasonable indisputable accuracy. 

### (c) When discretionary.

While the first sentence of the subdivision is taken from the Federal

 Rule, the second sentence is new and is included as a result of the clear

 implication of subdivision (e) and of the holding in _Garner v. Louisiana

_, 368 U.S. 157, 173-74 (1961). In _Garner,_ the Supreme

Court rejected the contention of the State of Louisiana that the trial judge

had taken judicial notice of certain evidence stating that: 

 There

is nothing in the records to indicate that the trial judge did in fact take

judicial notice of anything. To extend the doctrine of judicial notice ...

would require us to allow the prosecution to do through argument to this

Court what it is required by due process to do at the trial, and would be

to turn the doctrine into a pretext for dispensing with a trial of the facts

of which the court is taking judicial notice, not only does he not know upon

what evidence he is being convicted, but, in addition, he is deprived of

any opportunity to challenge the deductions drawn from such notice or to

dispute the notoriety or truth of the facts allegedly relied upon. 368 U.S.

at 173 

### (d) When mandatory.

Rule 201(d) provides that the military judge shall take notice when

 requested to do so by a party who supplies the military judge with the necessary

information. The military judge must take judicial notice only when the evidence

is properly within this Rule, is relevant under Rule 401, and is not inadmissible

under these Rules. 

### (e) Opportunity to be heard; Time of taking notice; Instructing Members.

Subdivisions (e), (f) and (g) of Rule 201 are taken from the Federal

Rule without change.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence. Former subsection (d) was subsumed into subsection (c) and the remaining subsections were renumbered accordingly. In recommending these changes, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 202. Judicial Notice of Law.

_In general._ Rule 201A is new. Not addressed by

the Federal Rules of Evidence, the subject matter of the Rule is treated

as a procedural matter in the Article III courts; _see e.g.,_ FED

R. CRIM. P. 26.1. Adoption of a new evidentiary rule was thus required. Rule

201A is generally consistent in principle with Para. 147 _a_,

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _Domestic law._ Rule 201A(a)

recognizes that law may constitute the adjudicative fact within the meaning

of Rule 201(a) and requires that when that is the case, _i.e.,_ insofar

as a domestic law is a fact that is of consequence to the determination of

the action, the procedural requirements of Rule 201 must be applied. When

domestic law constitutes only a legislative fact, _see_ the

Analysis to Rule 201(a), the procedural requirements of Rule 201 may be utilized

as a matter of discretion. For purposes of this Rule, it is intended that

 "domestic law" include: treaties of the United States; executive

 agreements between the United States and any State thereof, foreign country

or international organization or agency; the laws and regulations pursuant

thereto of the United States, of the District of Columbia, and of a State,

 Commonwealth, or possession; international law, including the laws of war,

 general maritime law and the law of air and space; and the common law. This

 definition is taken without change from Para. 147 _a_ except

 that references to the law of space have been added. "Regulations"

 of the United States include regulations of the armed forces. 

 When

a party requests that domestic law be noticed, or when the military judge _

sua sponte_ takes such notice, a copy of the applicable law should

be attached to the record of trial unless the law in question can reasonably

be anticipated to be easily available to any possible reviewing authority. 

 _

1984 Amendment:_ Subsection (a) was modified in 1984 to clarify that

the requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 201(g) do not apply when judicial notice

of domestic law is taken. Without this clarification, Mil. R. Evid. 201A

could be construed to require the military judge to instruct the members

that they could disregard a law which had been judicially noticed. This problem

was discussed in _ United States v. Mead_, 16 M.J. 270 (C.M.A.1983). 

 _

Foreign law._ Rule 201A(b) is taken without significant change from

FED R. CRIM. P 26.1 and recognizes that notice of foreign law may require

recourse to additional evidence including testimony of witnesses. For purposes

of this Rule, it is intended that "foreign law" include the laws

and regulations of foreign countries and their political subdivisions and

of international organizations and agencies. Any material or source received

by the military judge for use in determining foreign law, or pertinent extracts

therefrom, should be included in the record of trial as an exhibit.

 _2013 Amendment_. Former Rule 201A was renumbered so that it now appears as Rule 202. In previous editions, Rule 202 did not exist and therefore no other rules were renumbered as a result of this change. The phrase "in accordance with Mil. R. Evid. 104" was added to subsection (b) to clarify that Rule 104 controls the military judges relevancy determination.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

# Exclusionary Rules and Related Matters Concerning Self-Incrimination,

 Search and Seizure, and Eyewitness Identification

Military Rules of Evidence 301-306, 311-317, and 321

were new in 1980 and have no equivalent in the Federal Rules of Evidence.

They represent a partial codification of the law relating to self-incrimination,

 confessions and admissions, search and seizure, and eye-witness identification.

 They are often rules of criminal procedure as well as evidence and have been

 located in this section due to their evidentiary significance. They replace

 Federal Rules of Evidence 301 and 302 which deal with civil matters exclusively. 

 The

Committee believed it imperative to codify the material treated in Section

III because of the large numbers of lay personnel who hold important roles

within the military criminal legal system. Non-lawyer legal officers aboard

ship, for example, do not have access to attorneys and law libraries. In

all cases, the Rules represent a judgement that it would be impracticable

to operate without them. _See_ Article 36. The Rules represent

a compromise between specificity, intended to ensure stability and uniformity

with the armed forces, and generality, intended usually to allow change via

case law. In some instances they significantly change present procedure. _

See, e.g.,_ Rule 304(d) (procedure for suppression motions relating

to confessions and admissions).

 _2013 Amendment._ Former Rule 201A was renumbered so that it now appears as Rule 202. In previous editions, Rule 202 did not exist and therefore no other rules were renumbered as a result of this change. The phrase "in accordance with Mil. R. Evid. 104" was added to subsection (b) to clarify that Rule 104 controls the military judge's relevancy determination.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 301. Privilege concerning compulsory self-incrimination

### (a) General rule.

Rule 301(a) is consistent with the rule expressed in the first

paragraph, Para. 150 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), but omits the

 phrasing of the privileges and explicitly states that, as both variations

 apply, the accused or witness receives the protection of whichever privilege

 may be the more beneficial. The fact that the privilege extends to a witness

as well as an accused is inherent within the new phrasing which does not

 distinguish between the two. 

 The Rule states that the privileges

are applicable only "to evidence of a testimonial or communicative

nature," _Schmerber v. California_, 384 U.S. 757, 761

(1966). The meaning of "testimonial or communicative" for the

purpose of Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice is not fully

settled. Past decisions of the Court of Military Appeals have extended the

Article 31 privilege against self-incrimination to voice and handwriting

exemplars and perhaps under certain conditions to bodily fluids. _

United States v. Ruiz_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 181, 48 C.M.R. 797 (1974).

Because of the unsettled law in the area of bodily fluids, it is not the

intent of the Committee to adopt any particular definition of "testimonial

or communicative." It is believed, however, that the decisions of the

United States Supreme Court construing the Fifth Amendment, _e.g.,

Schmerber v. California_, 384 U.S. 757 (1966), should be persuasive

in this area. Although the right against self-incrimination has a number

of varied justifications, its primary purposes are to shield the individual's

thought processes from Government inquiry and to permit an individual to

refuse to _create_ evidence to be used against him. Taking

a bodily fluid sample from the person of an individual fails to involve either

concern. The fluid in question already exists; the individual's actions are

irrelevant to its seizure except insofar as the health and privacy of the

individual can be further protected through his or her cooperation. No persuasive

reason exists for Article 31 to be extended to bodily fluids. To the extent

that due process issues are involved in bodily fluid extractions, Rule 312

provides adequate protections. 

 The privilege against self-incrimination

does not protect a person from being compelled by an order or forced to exhibit

his or her body or other physical characteristics as evidence. Similarly,

the privilege is not violated by taking the fingerprints of an individual,

in exhibiting or requiring that a scar on the body be exhibited, in placing

an individual's feet in tracks, or by trying shoes or clothing on a person

or in requiring the person to do so, or by compelling a person to place a

hand, arm, or other part of the body under the ultra-violet light for identification

or other purposes. 

 The privilege is not violated by the use of

compulsion in requiring a person to produce a record or writing under his

or her control containing or disclosing incriminating matter when the record

or writing is under control in a representative rather than a personal capacity

as, for example, when it is in his or her control as the custodian for a

 non-appropriated fund. _See_,_ e.g.,_ Para.

150 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Sellers

_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 262, 30 C.M.R. 262 (1961); _United States

v. Haskins_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 365, 29 C.M.R. 181 (1960). 

### (b) Standing.

#### (1) In general.

Rule 301(b)(1) recites the first part of the third paragraph of

Para. 150 _b_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.) without change except that

the present language indicating that neither counsel nor the court may object

to a self-incriminating question put to the witness has been deleted as being

 unnecessary. 

#### (2) Judicial advice.

A clarified version of the military judge's responsibility under

 Para. 150 _b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) to warn an uninformed witness

 of the right against self-incrimination has been placed in Rule 301(b)(2).

The revised procedure precludes counsel asking in open court that a witness

be advised of his or her rights, a practice which the Committee deemed of

doubtful propriety. 

### (c) Exercise of the privilege.

The first sentence of Rule 301(c) restates generally the first

sentence of the second paragraph of Para. 150_ b_, MCM, 1969

 (Rev.). The language "unless it clearly appears to the military judge"

was deleted. The test involved is purely objective. 

 The second

sentence of Rule 301(c) is similar to the second and third sentences of the

second paragraph of Para. 150 _b_ but the language has been

rephrased. The present Manual's language states that the witness can be required

to answer if for "any other reason, he can successfully object to being

tried for any offense as to which the answer may supply information to incriminate

him . . ." Rule 301(c) provides: "A witness may not assert the privilege

if the witness is not subject to criminal penalty as a result of an answer

by reason of immunity, running of the statute of limitations, or similar

reason." It is believed that the new language is simpler and more accurate

as the privilege is properly defined in terms of consequence rather than

in terms of "being tried." In the absence of a possible criminal

penalty, to include the mere fact of conviction, there is no risk of self-incrimination.

It is not the intent of the Committee to adopt any particular definition

of "criminal penalty." It should be noted, however, that the

courts have occasionally found that certain consequences that are technically

non-criminal are so similar in effect that the privilege should be construed

to apply. _See_ _e.g., Spevack v. Klein_, 385

U.S. 511 (1967); _United States v. Ruiz_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 181,

48 C.M.R. 797 (1974). Thus, the definition of "criminal penalty"

may depend upon the facts of a given case as well as the applicable case

law. 

 It should be emphasized that an accused, unlike a witness,

need not take the stand to claim the privilege. 

#### (1) Immunity generally.

Rule 301(c)(1) recognizes that "testimonial" or "use

plus fruits" immunity is sufficient to overcome the privilege against

self-incrimination, _cf., United States v. Rivera_, 1 M.J.

107 (C.M.A. 1975), _reversing on other grounds,_ 49 C.M.R.

 259 (A.C.M.R. 1974), and declares that such immunity is adequate for purposes

 of the Manual. The Rule recognizes that immunity may be granted under federal

 statutes as well as under provisions of the Manual. 

#### (2) Notification of immunity or leniency.

The basic disclosure provision of Rule 301(c)(2) is taken from _

United States v. Webster_, 1 M.J. 216 (C.M.A. 1975). Disclosure should

take place prior to arraignment in order to conform with the timing requirements

of Rule 304 and to ensure efficient trial procedure. 

### (d) Waiver by a witness.

The first sentence of Rule 301(d) repeats without change the third

 sentence of the third paragraph of Para. 150 _b_ of MCM, 1969

(Rev.). 

 The second sentence of the Rule restates the second section

of the present rule but with a minor change of wording. The

present text reads: "The witness may be considered to have waived the

privilege to this extent by having made the answer, but such a waiver will

not extend to a rehearing or new or other trial," while the new language

is: "This limited waiver of the privilege applies only at the trial

at which the answer is given, does not extend to a rehearing or new or other

trial, and is subject to Rule 608(b)." 

### (e) Waiver by the accused.

Except for the reference to Rule 608(b), Rule 301 (e) generally

 restates the fourth sentence of the third rule of Para. 149

 _b_(1), MCM, 1969 (Rev.). "Matters" was substituted

 for "issues" for purposes of clarity. 

 The mere act

of taking the stand does not waive the privilege. If an accused testifies

on direct examination only as to matters not bearing upon the issue of guilt

or innocence of any offense for which the accused is being tried, as in Rule

304 (f), the accused may not be cross-examined on the issue of guilt or innocence

at all. _See_ Para. 149 _b_ (1), MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

and Rule 608(b). 

 The last sentence of the third rule of Para. 149 _b_(1), MCM, 1969 (Rev.) has been deleted as

unnecessary. The Analysis statement above, "The mere act of taking

the stand does not waive the privilege," reinforces the fact that waiver

depends upon the actual content of the accused's testimony. 

 The

last sentence of Rule 301(e) restates without significant change the sixth

sentence of the third rule of Para. 149 _ b_(1),

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (f) Effect of claiming the privilege.

#### (1) Generally.

Rule 301(f)(1) is taken without change from the fourth rule

of Para. 150 _b_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It should be noted that

it is ethically improper to call a witness with the intent of having the

witness claim a valid privilege against self-incrimination in open court, _

see, e.g.,_ ABA STANDARDS RELATING TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL

JUSTICE, STANDARDS RELATING TO THE PROSECUTION FUNCTION AND THE DEFENSE FUNCTION,

Prosecution Standard 3-5.7(c); Defense Standard 4-7.6(c) (Approved

draft 1979). 

 Whether and to what extent a military judge may permit

comment on the refusal of a witness to testify after his or her claimed reliance

on the privilege against self-incrimination has been determined by the judge

to be invalid is a question not dealt with by the Rule and one which is left

to future decisions for resolution. 

#### (2) On cross-examination.

This provision is new and is intended to clarify the situation in

 which a witness who has testified fully on direct examination asserts the

 privilege against self-incrimination on cross-examination. It incorporates

the prevailing civilian rule, which has also been discussed in military cases.

 _See_ _e.g., United States v. Colon-Atienza_,

22 U.S.C.M.A. 399, 47 C.M.R. 336 (1973); _United States v. Rivas_,

3 M.J. 282 (C.M.A. 1977). Where the assertion shields only "collateral"

matters- _i.e.,_ evidence of minimal importance (usually

dealing with a rather distant fact solicited for impeachment purposes)-it

is not appropriate to strike direct testimony. A matter is collateral when

sheltering it would create little danger of prejudice to the accused. Where

the privilege reaches the core of the direct testimony or prevents a full

inquiry into the credibility of the witness, however, striking of the direct

testimony would appear mandated. Cross-examination includes for the purpose

of Rule 301 the testimony of a hostile witness called as if on cross-examination. _

 See_ Rule 607. Depending upon the circumstances of the case, a refusal

 to strike the testimony of a Government witness who refuses to answer defense

 questions calculated to impeach the credibility of the witness may constitute

 prejudicial limitation of the accused's right to cross-examine the witness.

#### (3) Pretrial.

Rule 301(f)(3) is taken generally from Para. 140 _a_ (4),

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and follows the decisions of the United States Supreme Court

in _United States v. Hale_, 422 U.S. 171 (1975) and_

 Doyle v. Ohio_, 426 U.S. 610 (1976). _See also United States

v. Brooks_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 423, 31 C.M.R. 9 (1961); _United

States v. McBride_, 50 C.M.R. 126 (A.F.C.M.R. 1975). The prior Manual

 provision has been expanded to include a request to terminate questioning.

### (g) Instructions.

Rule 301(g) has no counterpart in the 1969 Manual. It is designed

to address the potential for prejudice that may occur when an accused exercises

 his or her right to remain silent. Traditionally, the court members have

been instructed to disregard the accused's silence and not to draw any adverse

 inference from it. However, counsel for the accused may determine that this

 very instruction may emphasize the accused's silence, creating a prejudicial

 effect. Although the Supreme Court has held that it is not unconstitutional

for a judge to instruct a jury over the objection of the accused to disregard

the accused's silence, it has also stated: "It may be wise for a trial

judge not to give such a cautionary instruction over a defendant's objection."

 _Lakeside v. Oregon_, 435 U.S. 333, 340-41 (1978). Rule 301(g)

 recognizes that the decision to ask for a cautionary instruction is one of

 great tactical importance for the defense and generally leaves that decision

 solely within the hands of the defense. Although the military judge may give

 the instruction when it is necessary in the interests of justice, the intent

of the Committee is to leave the decision in the hands of the defense in

all but the most unusual cases. _See also_ Rule 105. The military

judge may determine the content of any instruction that is requested to be

given. 

### (h) Miscellaneous.

The last portion of paragraph 150 _b_, MCM, 1969

 (Rev.), dealing with exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of due

 process, has been deleted and its content placed in the new Rules on search and seizure._

See e.g.,_ Rule 312, Bodily Views and Intrusions. The exclusionary

rule previously found in the last rule of Para. 150 _

b_ was deleted as being unnecessary in view of the general exclusionary

rule in Rule 304.

 _2013 Amendment._ In subsection (d), the committee intends that the word "answer" be defined as "a witness's . . . response to a question posed." _Black's Law Dictionary_ 100 (8th ed. 2004). Subsection (d) only applies when the witness's response to the question posed may be incriminating. It does not apply when the witness desires to make a statement that is unresponsive to the question asked for the purpose of gaining protection from the privilege.

 Former subsections (d) and (f)(2) were combined for ease of use. The issues typically arise chronologically in the course of a trial, because a witness often testifies on direct without asserting the privilege and then, during the ensuing cross-examination, asserts the privilege.

 Former subsection (b)(2) was moved to a discussion section because it addresses conduct rather than the admissibility of evidence. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. Also, the committee recommended changing the word "should" to "may" in light of CAAF's holding in _United States v. Bell_, 44 M.J. 403 (C.A.A.F. 1996). In that case, CAAF held that Congress did not intend for Article 31(b) warnings to apply at trial, and noted that courts have the discretion, but not an obligation, to warn witnesses on the stand. Bell, 44 M.J. at 405-06. If a member testifies at an Article 32 hearing or court-martial without receiving Article 31(b) warnings, his Fifth Amendment rights have not been violated and those statements can be used against him at subsequent proceedings. _Id_.

 In subsection (e), the phrase "concerning the issue of guilt or innocence" was removed because this subsection applies to the presentencing phase of the trial as well as the merits phase. The use of the term "concerning the issue of guilt or innocence" incorrectly implied that the subsection only referred to the merits phase. The rule was renamed "Limited Waiver," changed from "Waiver by the accused," to indicate that when an accused who is on trial for two or more offenses testifies on direct as to only one of the offenses, he has only waived his rights with respect to that offense and no other. Also, the committee recommended moving this subsection up in the rule and renumbering it in order to address the issue of limited waivers earlier because of the importance of preserving the accused's right against self-incrimination.

 As a result of the various recommended changes, the committee recommended renumbering the remaining subsections accordingly. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 302. Privilege concerning mental examination of an accused

_Introduction._ The difficulty giving rise to Rule

302 and its conforming changes is a natural consequence of the tension between

the right against self-incrimination and the favored position occupied by

the insanity defense. If an accused could place a defense expert on the stand

to testify to his lack of mental responsibility and yet refuse to cooperate

with a Government expert, it would place the prosecution in a disadvantageous

position. The courts have attempted to balance the competing needs and have

arrived at what is usually, although not always, an adequate compromise;

when an accused has raised a defense of insanity through expert testimony,

the prosecution may compel the accused to submit to Government psychiatric

examination on pain of being prevented from presenting any defense expert

testimony (or of striking what expert testimony has already presented). However,

at trial the expert may testify _only_ as to his or her conclusions

and their basis and not as to the contents of any statements made by the

accused during the examination. _See_ _e.g., United

States v. Albright_, 388 F.2d 719 (4th Cir. 1968); _United

States v. Babbidge_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 327, 40 C.M.R. 39 (1969). _

See generally,_ Frederic Lederer, _Rights Warnings in the Armed Services,

_ 72 Mil. L. Rev. 1 (1976); Don Holladay, _Pretrial Mental Examinations

Under Military Law: A Re-Examination_, 16 A.F. L. Rev. 14 (1974).

This compromise, which originally was a product of case law, is based on

the premise that raising an insanity defense is an implied partial waiver

of the privilege against self-incrimination and has since been codified in

the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Fed. R. Crim. P. 12-2, and MCM,

1969 (Rev.). Para. 140 _a_, 122 _b_, 150 _

 b_. The compromise, however, does not fully deal with the problem

in the military. 

 In contrast to the civilian accused who is more

likely to have access to a civilian doctor as an expert witness for the defense-a

 witness with no governmental status- the military accused normally

must rely upon the military doctors assigned to the local installation. In

the absence of a doctor-patient privilege, anything said can be expected

to enter usual Government medical channels. Once in those channels there

is nothing in the present Manual that prevents the actual psychiatric report

from reaching the prosecution and release of such information appears to

be common in contemporary practice. As a result, even when the actual communications

made by the accused are not revealed by the expert witness in open court,

under the 1969 Manual they may be studied by the prosecution and could be

used to discover other evidence later admitted against the accused. This

raises significant derivative evidence problems, _cf._ _

United States v. Rivera_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 430, 50 C.M.R. 389 (1975).

One military judge's attempt to deal with this problem by issuing a protective

order was commended by the Court of Military Appeals in an opinion that contained

a caveat from Judge Duncan that the trial judge may have exceeded his authority

in issuing the order, _United States v. Johnson_, 22 U.S.C.M.A.

424, 47 C.M.R. 401 (1973). 

 Further complicating this picture is

the literal language of Article 31(b) which states, in part, that "No

person subject to this chapter may ... request a statement from, an accused

or a person suspected of an offense without first informing him ..."

[of his rights]. Accordingly, a psychiatrist who complies

with the literal meaning of Article 31(b) may effectively and inappropriately

destroy the very protections created by _Babbidge_ and related

cases, while hindering the examination itself. At the same time, the validity

of warnings and any consequent "waiver" under such circumstances

is most questionable because _Babbidge_ never considered the

case of an accused forced to choose between a waiver and a prohibited or

limited insanity defense. Also left open by the present compromise is the

question of what circumstances, if any, will permit a prosecutor to solicit

the actual statements made by the suspect during the mental examination.

In _United States v. Frederick_, 3 M.J. 230 (C.M.A. 1977),

the Court of Military Appeals held that the defense counsel had opened the

door via his questioning of the witness and thus allowed the prosecution

a broader examination of the expert witness than would otherwise have been

allowed. At present, what constitutes "opening the door" is unclear.

An informed defense counsel must proceed with the greatest of caution being

always concerned that what may be an innocent question may be considered

to be an "open sesame." 

 Under the 1969 Manual interpretation

of _Babbidge, supra,_ the accused could refuse to submit to

a Government examination until after the actual presentation of defense expert

testimony on the insanity issue. Thus, trial might have to be adjourned for

a substantial period in the midst of the defense case. This was conducive

to neither justice nor efficiency. 

 A twofold solution to these

problems was developed. Rule 302 provides a form of testimonial immunity

intended to protect an accused from use of anything he might say during a

mental examination ordered pursuant to Para. 121, MCM, 1969 (Rev.) (now R.C.M.

706, MCM, 1984). Paragraph 121 was modified to sharply limit actual disclosure

of information obtained from the accused during the examination. Together,

these provisions would adequately protect the accused from disclosure of

any statements made during the examination. This would encourage the accused

to cooperate fully in the examination while protecting the Fifth Amendment

and Article 31 rights of the accused. 

 Paragraph 121 was retitled

to eliminate "Before Trial" and was thus made applicable before

and during trial. Pursuant to paragraph 121, an individual's belief or observations,

reflecting possible need for a mental examination of the accused, should

have been submitted to the convening authority with immediate responsibility

for the disposition of the charges or, after referral, to the military judge

or president of a special court-martial without a military judge. The submission

could, but needed not, be accompanied by a formal application for a mental

examination. While the convening authority could act on a submission under

paragraph 121 after referral, he or she might do so only when a military

judge was not reasonably available. 

 Paragraph 121 was revised

to reflect the new test for insanity set forth in _United States v.

Frederick_, 3 M.J. 230 (C.M.A. 1977), and to require sufficient information

for the fact finder to be able to make an intelligent decision rather than

necessarily relying solely upon an expert's conclusion. Further questions,

tailored to the individual case, could also be propounded. Thus, in an appropriate

case, the following might be asked: 

 Did the accused, at the time

of the alleged offense and as a result of such mental disease or defect,

lack substantial capacity to (possess actual knowledge), (entertain a specific

intent), (premeditate a design to kill)? 

 What is the accused's

intelligence level? 

 Was the accused under the influence of alcohol

or other drugs at the time of the offense? If so, what was the degree of

intoxication and was it voluntary? Does the diagnosis of alcoholism, alcohol

or drug induced organic brain syndrome, or pathologic intoxication apply? 

 As

the purpose of the revision of paragraph 121 and the creation of Rule 302

was purely to protect the privilege against self-incrimination of an accused

undergoing a mental examination related to a criminal case, both paragraph

121 and Rule 302 were inapplicable to proceedings not involving criminal

consequences. 

 The order to the sanity board required by paragraph

121 affects only members of the board and other medical personnel. Upon request

by a commanding officer of the accused, that officer shall be furnished a

copy of the board's full report. The commander may then make such use of

the report as may be appropriate (including consultation with a judge advocate)

subject only to the restriction on release to the trial counsel and to Rule

302. The restriction is fully applicable to all persons subject to the Uniform

Code of Military Justice. Thus, it is intended that the trial counsel receive

only the board's conclusions unless the defense should choose to disclose

specific matter. The report itself shall be released to the trial counsel,

minus any statements made by the accused, when the defense raises a sanity

issue at trial and utilizes an expert witness in its presentation. Rule 302(c). 

 Although

Rule 302(c) does not apply to determinations of the competency of the accused

to stand trial, paragraph 121 did prohibit access to the sanity board report

by the trial counsel except as specifically authorized. In the event that

the competency of an accused to stand trial was at issue, the trial counsel

could request, pursuant to paragraph 121, that the military judge disclose

the sanity board report to the prosecution. In such a case, the trial counsel

who had read the report would be disqualified from prosecuting the case in

chief if Rule 302(a) were applicable. 

 As indicated above, paragraph

121 required that the sanity board report be kept within medical channels

except insofar as it would be released to the defense and, upon request,

to the commanding officer of the accused. The paragraph expressly prohibited

any person from supplying the trial counsel with information relating to

the contents of the report. Care should be taken not to misconstrue the intent

of the provision. The trial counsel is dealt with specifically because in

the normal case it is only the trial counsel who is involved in the preparation

of the case at the stage at which a sanity inquiry is likely to take place.

Exclusion of evidence will result, however, even if the information is provided

to persons other than trial counsel if such information is the source of

derivative evidence. Rule 302 explicitly allows suppression of any evidence

resulting from the accused's statement to the sanity board, and evidence

derivative thereof, with limited exceptions as found in Rule 302. This is

consistent with the theory behind the revisions which treats the accused's

communication to the sanity board as a form of coerced statement required

under a form of testimonial immunity. For example, a commander who has obtained

the sanity board's report may obtain legal advice from a judge advocate,

including the staff judge advocate, concerning the content of the sanity

board's report. If the judge advocate uses the information in order to obtain

evidence against the accused or provides it to another person who used it

to obtain evidence to be used in the case, Rule 302 authorizes exclusion.

Commanders must take great care when discussing the sanity board report with

others, and judge advocates exposed to the report must also take great care

to operate within the Rule. 

### (a) General Rule.

Rule 302(a) provides that, absent defense offer, neither a statement

 made by the accused at a mental examination ordered under paragraph 121 nor

 derivative evidence thereof shall be received into evidence against the accused

 at trial on the merits or during sentencing when the Rule is applicable.

This should be treated as a question of testimonial immunity for the purpose

of determining the applicability of the exclusionary rule in the area. The

 Committee does not express an opinion as to whether statements made at such

a mental examination or derivative evidence thereof may be used in making

an adverse determination as to the disposition of the charges against the

accused. 

 Subject to Rule 302(b), Rule 302(a) makes statements

made by an accused at a paragraph 121 examination (now in R.C.M. 706(c),

MCM 1984) inadmissible even if Article 31 (b) and counsel warnings have been

given. This is intended to resolve problems arising from the literal interpretation

of Article 31 discussed above. It protects the accused and enhances the validity

 of the examination. 

### (b) Exceptions.

Rule 301(b) is taken from prior law; _see_ Para.

122 _b_, MCM 1969 (Rev.). The waiver provision of Rule 302(b)(1)

 applies only when the defense makes explicit use of statements made by the

 accused to a sanity board or derivative evidence thereof. The use of lay

 testimony to present an insanity defense is not derivative evidence when

the witness has not read the report. 

### (c) Release of evidence.

Rule 302(c) is new and is intended to provide the trial counsel

with sufficient information to reply to an insanity defense raised via expert

 testimony. The Rule is so structured as to permit the defense to choose how

 much information will be available to the prosecution by determining the

nature of the defense to be made. If the accused fails to present an insanity

defense or does so only through lay testimony, for example, the trial counsel

will not receive access to the report. If the accused presents a defense,

however, which includes specific incriminating statements made by the accused

to the sanity board, the military judge may order disclosure to the trial

counsel of "such statement. . . as may be necessary in the interest

of justice." 

 Inasmuch as the revision of paragraph 121 and

the creation of Rule 302 were intended primarily to deal with the situation

in which the accused denies committing an offense and only raises an insanity

defense as an alternative defense, the defense may consider that it is appropriate

to disclose the entire sanity report to the trial counsel in a case in which

the defense concedes the commission of the offense but is raising as its

sole defense the mental state of the accused. 

### (d) Non-compliance by the accused.

Rule 302(d) restates prior law and is in addition to any other lawful

 sanctions. As Rule 302 and the revised paragraph 121 adequately protect the

 accused's right against self-incrimination at a sanity board, sanctions other

 than that found in Rule 302(d) should be statutorily and constitutionally

 possible. In an unusual case these sanctions might include prosecution of

an accused for disobedience of a lawful order to cooperate with the sanity

board. 

### (e) Procedure.

Rule 302(e) recognizes that a violation of paragraph 121 or Rule

302 is in effect a misuse of immunized testimony-the coerced testimony

of the accused at the sanity board-and thus results in an involuntary

statement which may be challenged under Rule 304.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 303. Degrading questions

Rule 303 restates Article 31(c). The content of Para. 150 _

a_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.) has been omitted. 

 A specific application

of Rule 303 is in the area of sexual offenses. Under prior law, the victims

of such offenses were often subjected to a probing and degrading cross-examination

related to past sexual history- an examination usually of limited relevance

at best. Rule 412 of the Military Rules of Evidence now prohibits such questioning,

but Rule 412 is, however, not applicable to Article 32 hearings as it is

only a rule of evidence; _ see_ Rule 1101. Rule 303 and Article

31(c) on the other hand, are rules of privilege applicable to all persons,

military or civilian, and are thus fully applicable to Article 32 proceedings.

Although Rule 303 (Article 31(c)) applies only to "military tribunals,"

it is apparent that Article 31(c) was intended to apply to courts-of-inquiry,

and implicitly to Article 32 hearings. _The Uniform Code of Military

Justice, Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed

Services,_ 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 975 (1949). The Committee intends

that the expression "military tribunals" in Rule 303 includes

Article 32 hearings. 

 Congress found the information now safeguarded

by Rule 412 to be degrading. _See e.g.,_ Cong. Rec. H119944-45

(Daily ed. Oct. 10, 1978) (Remarks of Rep. Mann). As the material within

the constitutional scope of Rule 412 is inadmissible at trial, it is thus

not relevant let alone "material." Consequently that data within

the lawful coverage of Rule 412 is both immaterial and degrading and thus

is within the ambit of Rule 303 (Article 31(c)). 

 Rule 303 is

therefore the means by which the substance of Rule 412 applies to Article

32 proceedings, and no person may be compelled to answer a question that

would be prohibited by Rule 412. As Rule 412 permits a victim to refuse to

supply irrelevant and misleading sexual information at trial, so too does

the substance of Rule 412 through Rule 303 permit the victim to refuse to

 supply such degrading information at an Article 32 for use by the defense

or the convening authority. _See generally_ Rule 412 and the

 Analysis thereto. It should also be noted that it would clearly be unreasonable

 to suggest that Congress in protecting the victims of sexual offenses from

the degrading and irrelevant cross-examination formerly typical of sexual

cases would have intended to permit the identical examination at a military

 preliminary hearing that is not even presided over by a legally trained

individual. Thus public policy fully supports the application of Article 31(c)

 in this case. 

 _1993 Amendment:_ R.C.M. 405(i)

and Mil. R. Evid. 1101(d) were amended to make the provisions of Mil. R.

Evid. 412 applicable at pretrial investigations. These changes ensure that

the same protections afforded victims of nonconsensual sex offenses at trial

are available at pretrial hearings. _See_ Criminal Justice

Subcommittee of House Judiciary Committee Report, 94th Cong., 2d Session,

July 29, 1976. Pursuant to these amendments, Mil. R. Evid. 412 should be

applied in conjunction with Mil. R. Evid. 

303. As such, no witness may be

compelled to answer a question calling for a personally degrading response

prohibited by Rule 

303. Mil. R. Evid. 412, however, protects the victim even

if the victim does not testify. Accordingly, Rule 412 will prevent questioning

of the victim or other witness if the questions call for responses prohibited

by Rule 412.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 304. Confessions and admissions

### (a) General rule.

The exclusionary rule found in Rule 304(a) is applicable to Rules

 301-305, and basically restates prior law which appeared in paragraphs

 140 _a_(6) and 150 _b_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Rule

 304(b) does permit, however, limited impeachment use of evidence that is

 excludable on the merits. A statement that is not involuntary within the

 meaning of Rule 304(c)(3), Rule 305(a) or Rule 302(a) is voluntary and will

not be excluded under this Rule. 

 The seventh paragraph of Para.

150 _b_ of the 1969 Manual attempts to limit the derivative

evidence rule to _ statements_ obtained through _compulsion

_ that is "applied by, or at the instigation or with the participation

of, an _official or agent of the United States, or any State thereof

or political subdivision of either, who was acting in a governmental capacity. . ._" (emphasis added). Rule 304, however, makes all derivative

evidence inadmissible. Although some support for the 1969 Manual limitations

can be found in the literal phrasing of Article 31(d), the intent of the

Article as indicated in the commentary presented during the House hearings, _

The Uniform Code of Military Justice, Hearing on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm.

of the House Comm. on Armed Services,_81st Cong., 1st Sess. 984 (1949),

was to exclude "evidence" rather than just "statements."

Attempting to allow admission of evidence obtained from statements which

were the product of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement

would appear to be both against public policy and unnecessarily complicated.

Similarly, the 1969 Manual's attempt to limit the exclusion of derivative

evidence to that obtained through compulsion caused by "Government

agents" has been deleted in favor of the simpler exclusion of all derivative

evidence. This change, however, does not affect the limitation, as expressed

in current case law, that the warning requirements apply only when the interrogating

individual is either a civilian law enforcement officer or an individual

subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice acting in an official disciplinary

capacity or in a position of authority over a suspect or accused. The House

hearings indicate that all evidence obtained in violation of Article 31 was

to be excluded and all persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice

may violate Article 31(a). Consequently, the attempted 1969 Manual restriction

could affect at most only derivative evidence obtained from involuntary statements

compelled by private citizens. Public policy demands that private citizens

not be encouraged to take the law into their own hands and that law enforcement

agents not be encouraged to attempt to circumvent an accused's rights via

proxy interrogation. 

 It is clear that truly spontaneous statements

are admissible as they are not "obtained" from an accused or

suspect. An apparently volunteered statement which is actually the result

of coercive circumstances intentionally created or used by interrogators

will be involuntary. _Cf. Brewer v. Williams_, 430 U.S. 387

(1977), Rule 305(b)(2). Manual language dealing with this area has been deleted

as being unnecessary. 

### (b) Exceptions.

Rule 304(b)(1) adopts _Harris v. New York_, 401 U.S.

 222 (1971) insofar as it would allow use for impeachment or at a later trial

 for perjury, false swearing, or the making of a false official statement,

or statements taken in violation of the counsel warnings required under Rule

 305(d)-(e). Under Paras. 140 _a_(2) and 153b, MCM, 1969 (Rev.),

 use of such statements was not permissible. _United States v. Girard

_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 263, 49 C.M.R. 438 (1975); _United States

 v. Jordan_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 614, 44 C.M.R. 44 (1971). The Court of

 Military Appeals has recognized expressly the authority of the President

to adopt the holding in _Harris_ on impeachment. _

Jordan, supra,_ 20 U.S.C.M.A. 614, 617, 44 C.M.R. 44, 47, and Rule

304(b) adopts Harris to military law. A statement obtained in violation of

Article 31(b), however, remains inadmissible for all purposes, as is a statement

that is otherwise involuntary under Rules 302, 304(b)(3), or 305(a). It was

the intent of the Committee to permit use of a statement which is involuntary

 because the _waiver of counsel_ rights under Rule 305(g) was

 absent or improper which is implicit in Rule 304(b)'s reference to Rule 305(d). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Rule 304(b)(2) was added to incorporate the "inevitable

discovery" exception to the exclusionary rule based on _Nix

v. Williams,_ 467 U.S. 431, 104 S.Ct. 2501 (1984); _see also

United States v. Kozak_, 12 M.J. 389 (C.M.A. 1982); Analysis of Rule

311(b)(2). 

 _1990 Amendment:_ Subsection (b)(1)

was amended by adding "the requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 305(c) and

305(f), or." This language expands the scope of the exception and thereby

permits statements obtained in violation of Article 31(b), UCMJ, and Mil.

R. Evid. 305(c) and (f) to be used for impeachment purposes or at a later

trial for perjury, false swearing, or the making of a false official statement. _

See_ _Harris v. New York_, 401 U.S. 222 (1971); _

cf. United States v. Williams_, 23 M.J. 362 (C.M.A. 1987). An accused

cannot pervert the procedural safeguards of Article 31(b) into a license

to testify perjuriously in reliance on the Government's disability to challenge

 credibility utilizing the traditional truth-testing devices of the adversary

 process. _See_ _Walder v. United States_, 347

U.S. 62 (1954); _United States v. Knox_, 396 U.S. 77 (1969).

Similarly, when the procedural protections of Mil. R. Evid. 305(f) and _

Edwards v. Arizona_, 451 U.S. 477 (1981), are violated, the deterrent

effect of excluding the unlawfully obtained evidence is fully vindicated

by preventing its use in the Government's case-in-chief, but permitting its

collateral use to impeach an accused who testifies inconsistently or perjuriously. _

See_ _Oregon v. Hass_, 420 U.S. 714 (1975). Statements

which are not the product of free and rational choice, _Greenwald

v. Wisconsin_ , 390 U.S. 519 (1968), or are the result of coercion,

unlawful influence, or unlawful inducements are involuntary and thus inadmissible,

because of their untrustworthiness, even as impeachment evidence. _

See_ _Mincey v. Arizona_, 437 U.S. 385 (1978). 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ Rule 304(b)(1) adopts_ Harris v. New York

_, 401 U.S. 222 (1971), insofar as it would allow use for impeachment

or at a later trial for perjury, false swearing, or the making of a false

official statement, statements taken in violation of the counsel warnings

required under Mil R. Evid. 305(d)-(e). Under paragraphs 140a(2) and 153b,

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), use of such statements was not permissible. _ United

States v. Girard_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 263, 49 C.M.R. 438 (1975); _

United States v. Jordan_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 614, 44 C.M.R. 44 (1971).

The Court of Military Appeals has recognized expressly the authority of the

President to adopt the holding in _Harris_ on impeachment. _

Jordan_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. at 617, 44 C.M.R. at 47, and Mil R. Evid.

304(b) adopts _Harris_ in military law. Subsequently, in _

Michigan v. Harvey_, 494 U.S. 344 (1990), the Supreme Court held

that statements taken in violation of _Michigan v. Jackson_,

475 U.S. 625 (1986), could also be used to impeach a defendant's false and

inconsistent testimony. In so doing, the Court extended the Fifth Amendment

rationale of _Harris_ to Sixth Amendment violations of the

right to counsel. 

### (c) Definitions.

#### (1) Confession and admission.

Rules 304(c)(1) and (2) express without change the definitions found

 in Para. 140 _a_(1), MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Silence may constitute

an admission when it does not involve a reliance on the privilege against

 self-incrimination or related rights. Rule 301(f)(3). For example, if an

 imputation against a person comes to his or her attention under circumstances

 that would reasonably call for a denial of its accuracy if the imputation

were not true, a failure to utter such a denial could possibly constitute

an admission by silence. Note, however, in this regard, Rule 304(h)(3), and

Rule 801(a)(2). 

#### (2) Involuntary.

The  definition  of  "involuntary"  in  Rule 304(c)(3) summarizes the prior definition of "not voluntary" as found in Para. 140 _

a_(2), MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The examples in Para. 140 _a_(2)

are set forth in this paragraph. A statement obtained in violation of the

warning and waiver requirements of Rule 305 is "involuntary."

Rule 305(a). 

 The language governing statements obtained through

the use of "coercion, unlawful influence, and unlawful inducement,"

found in Article 31(d) makes it clear that a statement obtained by any person,

 regardless of status, that is the product of such conduct is involuntary.

 Although it is unlikely that a private citizen may run afoul of the prohibition

 of unlawful influence or inducement, such a person clearly may coerce a

statement and such coercion will yield an involuntary statement. 

 A

statement made by the accused during a mental examination ordered under Para.

121, MCM, 1969 (Rev.) (now R.C.M. 706, MCM, 1984) is treated as an involuntary

statement under Rule 304. _See_ Rule 302(a). The basis for

this rule is that Para. 121 and Rule 302 compel the accused to participate

in the Government examination or face a judicial order prohibiting the accused

from presenting any expert testimony on the issue of mental responsibility. 

 Insofar

as Rule 304(c)(3) is concerned, some examples which may by themselves or

in conjunction with others constitute coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful

inducement in obtaining a confession or admission are: 

 Infliction

of bodily harm including questioning accompanied by deprivation of the necessities

of life such as food, sleep, or adequate clothing; 

 Threats of

bodily harm; 

 Imposition of confinement or deprivation of privileges

or necessities because a statement was not made by the accused, or threats

thereof if a statement is not made; 

 Promises of immunity or clemency

as to any offense allegedly committed by the accused; 

 Promises

of reward or benefit, or threats of disadvantage likely to induce the accused

to make the confession or admission. 

 There is no change in the

principle, set forth in the fifth paragraph of Para. 140 _a_(2),

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), that a statement obtained "in an interrogation conducted

in accordance with all applicable rules is not involuntary because the interrogation

was preceded by one that was not so conducted, if it clearly appears that

all improper influences of the preceding interrogations had ceased to operate

on the mind of the accused or suspect at the time that he or she made the

statement." In such a case, the effect of the involuntary statement

is sufficiently attenuated to permit a determination that the latter statement

was not "_obtained_ in violation of" the rights

and privileges found in Rule 304(c)(3) and 305(a) (emphasis added). 

### (d) Procedure.

Rule 304(d) makes a significant change in prior procedure. Under

 Para. 140 _a_(2), MCM, 1969 (Rev.), the prosecution was required

 to prove a statement to be voluntary before it could be admitted in evidence

 absent explicit defense waiver. Rule 304(d) is intended to reduce the number

of unnecessary objections to evidence on voluntariness grounds and to narrow

what litigation remains by requiring the defense to move to suppress or to

object to evidence covered by this Rule. Failure to so move or object constitutes

a waiver of the motion or objection. This follows civilian procedure in which

the accused is provided an opportunity to assert privilege against self-incrimination

and related rights but may waive any objection to evidence obtained in violation

of the privilege through failure to object. 

#### (1) Disclosure.

Prior procedure (Para. 121, MCM, 1969 (Rev.)) is changed to assist

 the defense in formulating its challenges. The prosecution is required to

 disclose prior to arraignment all statements by the accused known to the

 prosecution which are relevant to the case (including matters likely to be

 relevant in rebuttal and sentencing) and within military control. Disclosure

 should be made in writing in order to prove compliance with the Rule and

to prevent misunderstandings. As a general matter, the trial counsel is not

 authorized to obtain statements made by the accused at a sanity board, with

 limited exceptions. If the trial counsel has knowledge of such statements,

they must be disclosed. Regardless of trial counsel's knowledge, the defense

is entitled to receive the full report of the sanity board. 

#### (2) Motions and objections.

The defense is required under Rule 304(d)(2) to challenge evidence

 disclosed prior to arraignment under Rule 304(d)(1) prior to submission of

 plea. In the absence of a motion or objection prior to plea, the defense

may not raise the issue at a later time except as permitted by the military

judge for good cause shown. Failure to challenge disclosed evidence waives

the objection. This is a change from prior law under which objection traditionally

 has been made after plea but may be made, at the discretion of the military

 judge, prior to plea. This change brings military law into line with civilian

 federal procedure and resolves what is presently a variable and uncertain

procedure. 

 Litigation of a defense motion to suppress or an objection

to a statement made by the accused or to any derivative evidence should take

place at a hearing held outside the presence of the court members. _

 See, e.g.,_ Rule 104(c). 

#### (3) Specificity.

Rule 304(d)(3) permits the military judge to require the defense

to specify the grounds for an objection under Rule 304, but if the defense

has not had adequate opportunity to interview those persons present at the

taking of a statement, the military judge may issue an appropriate order

including granting a continuance for purposes of interview or permitting

a general objection. In view of the waiver that results in the event of failure

to object, defense counsel must have sufficient information in order to decide

whether to object to the admissibility of a statement by the accused. Although

telephone or other long distance communications may be sufficient to allow

a counsel to make an informed decision, counsel may consider a personal interview

to be essential in this area and in such a case counsel is entitled to personally

interview the witnesses to the taking of a statement before specificity can

be required. When such an interview is desired but despite due diligence

counsel has been unable to interview adequately those persons included in

the taking of a statement, the military judge has authority to resolve the

situation. Normally this would include the granting of a continuance for

interviews, or other appropriate relief. If an adequate opportunity to interview

is absent, even if this results solely from the witness' unwillingness to

speak to the defense, then the specificity requirement does not apply. Lacking

adequate opportunity to interview, the defense may be authorized to enter

a general objection to the evidence. If a general objection has been authorized,

the prosecution must present evidence to show affirmatively that the statement

was voluntary in the same manner as it would be required to do under prior

law. Defense counsel is not required to meet the requirements of Para. 115,

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), in order to demonstrate "due diligence" under

the Rule. Nor shall the defense be required to present evidence to raise

a matter under the Rule. The defense shall present its motion by offer of

proof, but it may be required to present evidence in support of the motion

should the prosecution first present evidence in opposition to the motion. 

 If

a general objection to the prosecution evidence is not authorized, the defense

may be required by Rule 304(d)(3) to make specific objection to prosecution

evidence. It is not the intent of the Committee to require extremely technical

pleading, but enough specificity to reasonably narrow the issue is desirable.

Examples of defense objections include but are not limited to one or more

of the following non-exclusive examples: 

 That the accused was

a suspect but not given Article 31(b) or Rule 305(c) warnings prior to interrogation. 

  That

although 31(b) or Rule 305(c) warnings were given, counsel warnings under

Rule 305(d) were necessary and not given (or given improperly). (Rule 305(d); _

United States v. Tempia,_ 16 U.S.C.M.A. 629, 37 C.M.R. 249 (1967).) 

 That

despite the accused's express refusal to make a statement, she was questioned

and made an admission. (_see e.g.,_ Rule 305(f); _

Michigan v. Mosely,_ 423 U.S. 96 (1975); _United States v.

Westmore,_ 17 U.S.C.M.A. 406, 38 C.M.R. 204 (1968).) 

  That

the accused requested counsel but was interrogated by the military police

without having seen counsel. (_see e.g.,_ Rule 305(a) and

(d); _United States v. Gaines,_ 21 U.S.C.M.A. 236, 45 C.M.R.

10 (1972).) 

  That the accused was induced to make a statement

by a promise of leniency by his squadron commander. (_see e.g.,_ Rule

 304(b)(3), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Rev. ed.), Para

 140a(2); _People v. Pineda,_ 182 Colo. 388, 513 P.2d 452 (1973).) 

  That

an accused was threatened with prosecution of her husband if she failed to

make a statement. (_see e.g.,_ Rule 304(b)(3), _Jarriel

v. State,_ 317 So. 2d 141 (Fla. App. 1975).) 

  That

the accused was held incommunicado and beaten until she confessed.

(_see e.g.,_ Rule 304(b)(3); _Payne v. Arkansas,_ 356

U.S. 560 (1958).) 

  That the accused made the statement in

question only because he had previously given a statement to his division

officer which was involuntary because he was improperly warned.

(_see e.g.,_ Rule 304(b)(3); _United States v. Seay,_ 1

M.J. 201 (C.M.A. 1978).) 

 Although the prosecution retains at all

times the burden of proof in this area, a specific defense objection under

this Rule must include enough facts to enable the military judge to determine

whether the objection is appropriate. These facts will be brought before

the court via recital by counsel; the defense will not be required to offer

evidence in order to raise the issue. If the prosecution concurs with the

defense recital, the facts involved will be taken as true for purposes of

the motion and evidence need not be presented. If the prosecution does not

concur and the defense facts would justify relief if taken as true, the prosecution

will present its evidence and the defense will then present its evidence.

The general intent of this provision is to narrow the litigation as much

as may be possible without affecting the prosecution's burden. 

 In

view of the Committee's intent to narrow litigation in this area, it has

adopted a basic structure in which the defense, when required by the military

judge to object with specificity, has total responsibility in terms of what

objection, if any, to raise under this Rule. 

#### (4) Rulings.

Rule 304(d)(4) is taken without significant change from Federal

Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(e). As a plea of guilty waives all self-incrimination

 or voluntariness objections, Rule 304(d)(5), it is contemplated that litigation

 of confession issues raised before the plea will be fully concluded prior

to plea. Cases involving trials by military judge alone in which the accused

will enter a plea of not guilty are likely to be the only ones in which deferral

of ruling is even theoretically possible. If the prosecution does not intend

to use against the accused a statement challenged by the accused under this

Rule but is unwilling to abandon any potential use of such statement, two

options exist. First, the matter can be litigated before plea, or second,

if the accused clearly intends to plead not guilty regardless of the military

judge's ruling as to the admissibility of the statements in question, the

matter may be deferred until such time as the prosecution indicates a desire

to use the statements. 

#### (5) Effect of guilty plea.

Rule 304(d)(5) restates prior law; _see, e.g., United States

 v. Dusenberry_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 287, 49 C.M.R. 536 (1975). 

### (e) Burden of proof.

Rule 304(e) substantially changes military law. Under the prior

 system, the armed forces did not follow the rule applied in the civilian

 federal courts. Instead, MCM, 1969 (Rev.) utilized the minority "Massachusetts

Rule," sometimes known as the "Two Bite Rule." Under this

procedure the defense first raises a confession or admission issue before

the military judge who determines it on a preponderance basis: if the judge

determines the issue adversely to the accused, the defense may raise the

issue again before the members. In such a case, the members must be instructed

not to consider the evidence in question unless they find it to have been

voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. The Committee determined that this bifurcated

system unnecessarily complicated the final instructions to the members to

such an extent as to substantially confuse the important matters before them.

In view of the preference expressed in Article 36 for the procedure used

in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, the

Committee adopted the majority "Orthodox Rule" as used in Article

III courts. Pursuant to this procedure, the military judge determines the

admissibility of confessions or admissions using a preponderance basis. No

recourse exists to the court members on the question of admissibility. In

the event of a ruling on admissibility adverse to the accused, the accused

may present evidence to the members as to voluntariness for their consideration

in determining what weight to give to the statements in question. 

 It

should be noted that under the Rules the prosecution's burden extends only

to the specific issue raised by the defense under Rule 304(d), should specificity

have been required pursuant to Rule 304(d)(3). 

#### (1) In general.

Rule 304(e)(1) requires that the military judge find by a preponderance

that a statement challenged under this rule was made voluntarily. When a

trial is before a special court-martial without a military judge, the ruling

of the President of the court is subject to objection by any member. The

President's decision may be overruled. The Committee authorized use of this

 procedure in view of the importance of the issue and the absence of a legally

 trained presiding officer. 

#### (2) Weight of the evidence. 

Rule 304(e)(2) allows the defense to present evidence with respect

to voluntariness to the members for the purpose of determining what weight

to give the statement. When trial is by judge alone, the evidence received

by the military judge on the question of admissibility also shall be considered

by the military judge on the question of weight without the necessity of

a formal request to do so by counsel. Additional evidence may, however, be

presented to the military judge on the matter of weight if counsel chooses

to do so. 

#### (3) Derivative evidence.

Rule 304(e)(3) recognizes that derivative evidence is distinct from

 the primary evidence dealt with by Rule 304, _i.e.,_ statements.

 The prosecution may prove that notwithstanding an involuntary statement,

the evidence in question was not "obtained by use of" it and

is not derivative. 

 _February 1986 Amendment:_ Because

of the 1986 addition of Rule 304(b)(2), the prosecution may prove that, notwithstanding

an involuntary statement, derivative evidence is admissible under the "inevitable

discovery" exception. The standard of proof is a preponderance of the

evidence (_Nix v. Williams_, 467 U.S. 431, 104 S.Ct. 2501

(1984)). 

### (f) Defense evidence.

Rule 304(f) generally restates prior law as found in Para. 140 _

a_(3) & (6), MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Under this Rule, the defense must

specify that the accused plans to take the stand under this subdivision.

This is already normal practice and is intended to prevent confusion. Testimony

 given under this subdivision may not be used at the same trial at which it

is given for any other purpose to include impeachment. The language, "the

 accused may be cross-examined only as to matter on which he or she so testifies"

permits otherwise proper and relevant impeachment of the accused. _

See_,_ e.g.,_ Rule 607-609; 613. 

### (g) Corroboration.

Rule 304(g) restates the prior law of corroboration with one major

 procedural change. Previously, no instruction on the requirement of corroboration

was required unless the evidence was substantially conflicting, self-contradictory,

uncertain, or improbable and there was a defense request for such an instruction. _

United States v. Seigle,_ 22 U.S.C.M.A. 403, 47 C.M.R. 340 (1973).

The holding in _Seigle_ in consistent with the 1969 Manual's

view that the issue of admissibility may be decided by the members, but it

is inconsistent with the position taken in Rule 304(d) that admissibility

is the sole responsibility of the military judge. Inasmuch as the Rule requires

corroborating evidence as a condition precedent to admission of the statement,

submission of the issue to the members would seem to be both unnecessary

and confusing. Consequently, the Rule does not follow _Seigle_ insofar

as the case allows the issue to be submitted to the members. The members

must still weigh the evidence when determining the guilt or innocence of

the accused, and the nature of any corroborating evidence is an appropriate

matter for the members to consider when weighing the statement before them. 

 The

corroboration rule requires only that evidence be admitted which would support

an inference that the essential facts admitted in the statement are true.

For example, presume that an accused charged with premeditated murder has

voluntarily confessed that, intending to kill the alleged victim, she concealed

herself so that she might surprise the victim at a certain place and that

when the victim passed by, she plunged a knife in his back. At trial, the

prosecution introduces independent evidence that the victim was found dead

as a result of a knife wound in his back at the place where, according to

the confession, the incident occurred. This fact would corroborate the confession

because it would support an inference of the truth of the essential facts

admitted in the confession. 

### (h) Miscellaneous.

#### (1) Oral statements.

Rule 304(h)(1) is taken verbatim from 1969 Manual paragraph 140

 _a_(6). It recognizes that although an oral statement may

be transcribed, the oral statement is separate and distinct from the transcription

 and that accordingly the oral statement may be received into evidence without

 violation of the best evidence rule unless the specific writing is in question,

 _see_ Rule 1002. So long as the oral statement is complete,

no specific rule would require the prosecution to offer the transcription.

The defense could of course offer the writing when it would constitute impeachment.

#### (2) Completeness.

Rule 304(h)(2) is taken without significant change from 1969 Manual

 paragraph 140 _a_(6). Although Rule 106 allows a party to

 require an adverse party to complete an otherwise incomplete written statement

 in an appropriate case, Rule 304(h)(2) allows the defense to complete an

 incomplete statement regardless of whether the statement is oral or in writing.

 As Rule 304(h)(2) does not by its terms deal only with oral statements, it

 provides the defense in this area with the option of using Rule 106 or 304(h)(2)

to complete a written statement. 

#### (3) Certain admission by silence.

Rule 304(h)(3) is taken from Para. 140 _a_(4) of

the 1969 Manual. That part of the remainder of Para. 140 _a_(4)

 dealing with the existence of the privilege against self-incrimination is

now set forth in Rule 301(f)(3). The remainder of Para. 140 _a_(4)

 has been set forth in the Analysis to subdivision (d)(2), dealing with an

 admission by silence, or has been omitted as being unnecessary. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Mil. R. Evid. 304(h)(4) was added to make clear

that evidence of a refusal to obey a lawful order to submit to a chemical

analysis of body substances is admissible evidence when relevant either to

a violation of such order or an offense which the test results would have

been offered to prove. The Supreme Court in _South Dakota v. Neville

_, 459 U.S. 553 (1983) held that where the government may compel

an individual to submit to a test of a body substance, evidence of a refusal

to submit to the test is constitutionally admissible. Since the results of

tests of body substances are non-testimonial, a servicemember has no Fifth

Amendment or Article 31 right to refuse to submit to such a test. _

United  States  v. Armstrong_,  9 M.J. 374  (C.M.A. 1980); _Schmerber

v. State of California_, 384 U.S. 757 (1966). A test of body substances

in various circumstances, such as search incident to arrest, probable cause

and exigent circumstances, and inspection or random testing programs, among

others, is a reasonable search and seizure in the military. _Murray

v. Haldeman_, 16 M.J. 74 (C.M.A. 1983); Mil. R. Evid. 312; Mil. R.

Evid. 313. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a military order is

a valid means to compel a servicemember to submit to a test of a body substance. _

Murray v. Haldeman, supra._ Evidence of a refusal to obey such an

order may be relevant as evidence of consciousness of guilt. _People

v. Ellis_, 65 Cal.2d 529, 421 P.2d 393 (1966). _See also State

v. Anderson_, Or.App., 631 P.2d 822 (1981); _Newhouse v. Misterly

_, 415 F.2d 514 (9th Cir. 1969), _ cert. denied_ 397

U.S. 966 (1970). 

 _This Rule creates no right to refuse

a lawful order._ A servicemember may still be compelled to submit

to the test. _See_, _e.g.,_ Mil. R. Evid. 312.

Any such refusal may be prosecuted separately for violation of an order.

 _2013 Amendment._ Former subsection (c), which contains definitions of words used throughout the rule, was moved so that it immediately follows subsection (a) and is highly visible to the practitioner. Former subsection (h)(3), which discusses denials, was moved to subsection (a)(2) so that it is included near the beginning of the rule to highlight the importance of an accused's right to remain silent. The committee recommended moving and renumbering the remaining subsections so the rule generally follows the chronology of how the issues might arise at trial. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 In subsection (b), the committee recommended adding the term "allegedly" in reference to derivative evidence to clarify that evidence is not derivative unless a military judge finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it is derivative.

 In subsections (c)(5), (d), (f)(3)(A), and (f)(7), the committee recommended replacing the word "shall" with "will" or "must" because the committee agreed with the approach of the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules to minimize the use of words such as "shall" because of the potential disparity in application and interpretation of whether the word is precatory or prescriptive.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 305. Warnings About Rights

### (a) General Rule.

Rule 305(a) makes statements obtained in violation of Rule 305,

 _e.g.,_ statements obtained in violation of Article 31(b)

and the right to counsel, involuntary within the meaning of Rule 304. This

approach eliminates any distinction between statements obtained in violation

of the common law voluntariness doctrine (which is, in any event, included

within Article 31(d) and those statements obtained in violation, for example,

of _Miranda_ (_Miranda v. Arizona_, 384 U.S.

436 (1966) warning requirements). This is consistent with the approach taken

in the 1969 Manual, _e.g.,_ Para. 140 _a_(2).

### (b) Definitions.

#### (1) Persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Rule 305(b)(1) makes it clear that under certain conditions a civilian

may be a "person subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice"

for purposes of warning requirements, and would be required to give Article

31(b) (Rule 305(c)) warnings. _See, generally, United States v. Penn

_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 194, 39 C.M.R. 194 (1969). Consequently civilian

members of the law enforcement agencies of the Armed Forces, _ e.g.,

_ the Naval Investigative Service and the Air Force Office of Special

Investigations, will have to give Article 31 (Rule 305(c)) warnings. This

provision is taken in substance from Para. 140 _a_(2) of the

1969 Manual. 

#### (2) Interrogation.

Rule 305(b)(2) defines interrogation to include the situation in

 which an incriminating response is either sought or is a reasonable consequence

 of such questioning. The definition is expressly not a limited one and interrogation

thus includes more than the putting of questions to an individual. _

See e.g., Brewer v. Williams_, 430 U.S. 387 (1977). 

 The

Rule does not specifically deal with the situation in which an "innocent"

question is addressed to a suspect and results unexpectedly in an incriminating

response which could not have been foreseen. This legislative history and

the cases are unclear as to whether Article 31 allows nonincriminating questioning.

_See_ Frederic Lederer, _Rights, Warnings in the Armed Services,_ 72 Mil. L.

Rev. 1, 32-33 (1976), and the issue is left open for further development.

### (c) Warnings concerning the accusation, right to remain silent, and use

of statement.

Rule 305(c) basically requires that those persons who are required

by statute to give Article 31(b) warnings give such warnings. The Rule refrains

 from specifying who must give such warnings in view of the unsettled nature

of the case law in the area.

 It was not the intent of the Committee

to adopt any particular interpretation of Article 31(b) insofar as who must

give warnings except as provided in Rule 305(b)(1) and the Rule explicitly

defers to Article 31 for the purpose of determining who must give warnings.

The Committee recognized that numerous decisions of the Court of Military

Appeals and its subordinate courts have dealt with this issue. These courts

have rejected literal application of Article 31(b), but have not arrived

at a conclusive rule. _See e.g., United States v. Dohle_,

1 M.J. 223 (C.M.A. 1975). The Committee was of the opinion, however, that

both Rule 305(c) and Article 31(b) should be construed at a minimum, and

in compliance with numerous cases, as requiring warnings by those personnel

acting in an official disciplinary or law enforcement capacity. Decisions

such as _United States v. French_, 25 C.M.R. 851 (A.F.B.R.

1958), _aff'd in relevant part,_ 10 U.S.C.M.A. 171, 27 C.M.R.

245 (1959) (undercover agent) are not affected by the Rule. 

 Spontaneous

or volunteered statements do not require warnings under Rule 305. The fact

that a person may have known of his or her rights under the Rule is of no

importance if warnings were required but not given. 

 Normally,

neither a witness nor an accused need to be warned under any part of this

Rule when taking the stand to testify at a trial by court-martial. _

See_, however, Rule 801(b)(2). 

 The Rule requires in Rule

305(c)(2) that the accused or suspect be advised that he or she has the "right

to remain silent" rather than the statutory Article 31(b) warning which

is limited to silence on matters relevant to the underlying offense. The

new language was inserted upon the suggestion of the Department of Justice

in order to provide clear advice to the accused as to the absolute right

to remain silent. _See Miranda v. Arizona,_ 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

### (d) Counsel rights and warnings.

Rule 305(d) provides the basic right to counsel at interrogations

and requires that an accused or suspect entitled to counsel at an interrogation

be warned of that fact. The Rule restates the basic counsel entitlement for

 custodial interrogations found in both Para. 140 _c_(2), MCM,

 1969 (Rev.), and_ United States v. Tempia_, 16 U.S.C.M.A.

629, 37 C.M.R. 249 (1967), and recognizes that the right to counsel attaches

after certain procedural steps have taken place. 

#### (1) General rule.

Rule 305(d)(1) makes it clear that the right to counsel only attaches

 to an interrogation in which an individual's Fifth Amendment privilege against

 self-incrimination is involved. This is a direct result of the different

 coverages of the statutory and constitutional privileges. The Fifth Amendment

 to the Constitution of the United States is the underpinning of the Supreme

 Court's decision in _Miranda v. Arizona_, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)

 which is in turn the origin of the military right to counsel at an interrogation. _

United States v. Tempia_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 629, 37 C.M.R. 249 (1967).

Article 31, on the other hand, does not provide any right to counsel at an

interrogation; _but see United States v. McOmber_, 1 M.J.

380 (C.M.A. 1976). Consequently, interrogations which involve only the Article

31 privilege against self-incrimination do not include a right to counsel.

Under present law such interrogations include requests for voice and handwriting

samples and perhaps request for bodily fluids. _Compare_ _

United States v. Dionivio_, 410 U.S. 1 (1973); _United States

v. Mara_, 410 U.S. 19 (1973); and _Schmerber v. California

_, 384 U.S. 757 (1967) with _United States v. White_,

17 U.S.C.M.A. 211, 38 C.M.R. 9 (1967); _United States v. Greer_,

3 U.S.C.M.A. 576, 13 C.M.R. 132 (1953); and _United States v. Ruiz

_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 181, 48 C.M.R. 797 (1974). Rule 305(d)(1) requires

that an individual who is entitled to counsel under the Rule be advised of

the nature of that right before an interrogation involving evidence of a

testimonial or communicative nature within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment

(an interrogation as defined in Rule 305(d)(2) and modified in this case

by Rule 305(d)(1)) may lawfully proceed. Although the Rule does not specifically

require any particular wording or format for the right to counsel warning,

reasonable specificity is required. At a minimum, the right to counsel warning

must include the following substantive matter: 

(1) That the accused or suspect has the right to be represented by a

 lawyer at the interrogation if he or she so desires; 

(2) That the right to have counsel at the interrogation includes the

 right to consult with counsel and to have counsel at the interrogation;

(3) That if the accused or suspect so desires, he or she will have a

 military lawyer appointed to represent the accused or suspect at the interrogation

at no expense to the individual, and the accused or suspect may obtain civilian

counsel at no expense to the Government in addition to or instead of free

military counsel. 

 It is important to note that those warnings

are in addition to such other warnings and waiver questions as may be required

by Rule 305. 

 Rule 305(d)(1)(A) follows the plurality of civilian

jurisdiction by utilizing an objective test in defining "custodial"

 interrogation. _See also_ _United States v. Temperley

_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 383, 47 C.M.R. 235 (1978). Unfortunately, there

is no national consensus as to the exact nature of the test that should be

used. The language used in the Rule results from an analysis of _

Miranda v. Arizona_, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) which leads to the conclusion

that _Miranda_ is predominately a voluntariness decision concerned

with the effects of the psychological coercion inherent in official questioning. _

See e.g._, Frederic Lederer, _Miranda v. Arizona-The Law Today,_ 78 Mil.

L. Rev. 107, 130 (1977). 

 The variant chosen adopts an objective

test that complies with _Miranda's_ intent by using the viewpoint

of the suspect. The objective nature of the test, however, makes it improbable

that a suspect would be able to claim a custodial status not recognized by

the interrogator. The test makes the actual belief of the suspect irrelevant

 because of the belief that it adds nothing in practice and would unnecessarily

lengthen trial. 

 Rule 305(d)(1)(B) codifies the Supreme Court's

decisions in _Brewer v. Williams_, 480 U.S. 387 (1977) and _

Massiah v. United States_, 377 U.S. 201 (1964). As modified by _

Brewer, Massiah_ requires that an accused or suspect be advised of

his or her right to counsel prior to interrogation, whether open or surreptitious,

if that interrogation takes place after either arraignment or indictment.

As the Armed Forces lack any equivalent to those civilian procedural points,

the initiation of the formal military criminal process has been utilized

as the functional equivalent. Accordingly, the right to counsel attaches

if an individual is interrogated after preferral of charges or imposition

of pretrial arrest, restriction, or confinement. The right is not triggered

by apprehension or temporary detention. Undercover investigation prior to

the formal beginning of the criminal process will not be affected by this,

but jailhouse interrogations will generally be prohibited. _Compare

_ Rule 305(d)(1)(B) with _United States v. Hinkson_,

17 U.S.C.M.A. 126, 37 C.M.R. 390 (1967) and _United States v. Gibson

_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 746, 14 C.M.R. 164 (1954). 

 _1994

Amendment:_ Subdivision (d) was amended to conform military practice

with the Supreme Court's decision in _McNeil v. Wisconsin_,

501 U.S. 171 (1991). In _McNeil_, the Court clarified the

distinction between the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment

right to counsel. The court reiterated that the Sixth Amendment right to

counsel does not attach until the initiation of adversary proceedings. In

the military, the initiation of adversary proceedings normally occurs at

preferral of charges. _See United States v. Jordan_, 29 M.J.

177, 187 (C.M.A. 1989); _United States v. Wattenbarger_,

21 M.J. 41, 43 (C.M.A. 1985), _cert. denied_, 477 U.S. 904

(1986). However, it is possible that, under unusual circumstances, the courts

may find that the Sixth Amendment right attaches prior to preferral. _

See Wattenbarger_, 21 M.J. at 43-44. Since the imposition of conditions

on liberty, restriction, arrest, or confinement does not trigger the Sixth

Amendment right to counsel, references to these events were eliminated from

the rule. These events may, however, be offered as evidence that the government

has initiated adversary proceedings in a particular case. 

#### (2) Counsel.

Rule 305(d)(2) sets forth the basic right to counsel at interrogations

required under 1969 Manual Para. 140 _a_(2). The Rule rejects

the interpretation of Para. 140 _a_(2) set forth in _

United States v. Hofbauer_, 5 M.J. 409 (C.M.A. 1978) and_

United States v. Clark_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 570, 48 C.M.R. 77 (1974) which

 held that the Manual only provided a right to military counsel at an interrogation

in the event of financial indigency. 

 Rule

305(d)(2) clarifies prior practice insofar as it explicitly indicates that

no right to individual military counsel of the suspect's or accused's choice

exists. _See e.g., United States v. Wilcox_, 3 M.J. 803 (A.C.M.R.

1977). 

### (e) Notice to Counsel.

Rule 305(e) is taken from _United States v. McOmber_,

 1 M.J. 380 (C.M.A. 1976). The holding of that case has been expanded slightly

 to clarify the situation in which an interrogator does not have actual knowledge

that an attorney has been appointed for or retained by the accused or suspect

with respect to the offenses, but reasonably should be so aware. In the absence

of the expansion, present law places a premium on law enforcement ignorance

and has the potential for encouraging perjury. The change rejects the view

expressed in _United States v. Roy_, 4 M.J. 840 (A.C.M.R.

1978) which held that in the absence of bad faith a criminal investigator

who interviewed the accused one day before the scheduled Article 32 investigation

 was not in violation of _McOmber_ because he was unaware of

the appointment of counsel. 

 Factors which may be considered in

determining whether an interrogator should have reasonably known that an

individual had counsel for purposes of this Rule include: 

 Whether

the interrogator knew that the person to be questioned had requested counsel; 

 Whether

the interrogator knew that the person to be questioned had already been involved

in a pretrial proceeding at which he would ordinarily be represented by counsel; 

 Any

regulations governing the appointment of counsel; 

 Local standard

operating procedures; 

 The interrogator's military assignment and

training; and 

 The interrogator's experience in the area of military

criminal procedure. 

 The standard involved is purely an objective

one. 

 _1994 Amendment:_ Subdivision (e) was amended

to conform military practice with the Supreme Court's decisions in_

Minnick v. Mississippi_, 498 U.S. 146 (1990), and _McNeil

v. Wisconsin_, 501 U.S. 171 (1991). Subdivision (e) was divided

into two subparagraphs to distinguish between the right to counsel rules

under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and to make reference to the new waiver

provisions of subdivision (g)(2). Subdivision (e)(1) applies an accused's

Fifth Amendment right to counsel to the military and conforms military practice

with the Supreme Court's decision in _Minnick_. In that case,

the Court determined that the Fifth Amendment right to counsel protected

by _ Miranda v. Arizona_, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and _

Edwards v. Arizona_, 451 U.S. 477 (1981), as interpreted in _

Arizona v. Roberson_, 486 U.S. 675 (1988), requires that when a suspect

in custody requests counsel, interrogation shall not proceed unless counsel

is _ present_. Government officials may not reinitiate custodial _

 interrogation_ in the absence of counsel whether or not the accused

has consulted with his attorney. _Minnick_, 498 U.S. at 150-152.

 This rule does not apply, however, when the accused or suspect initiates

 reinterrogation regardless of whether the accused is in custody. _

 Minnick_, 498 U.S. at 154-55; _Roberson_, 486 U.S.

at 677. The impact of a waiver of counsel rights upon the _Minnick

_ rule is discussed in the analysis to subdivision (g)(2) of this

rule. Subdivision (e)(2) follows _McNeil_ and applies the

Sixth Amendment right to counsel to military practice. Under the Sixth Amendment,

an accused is entitled to representation at critical confrontations with

the government after the initiation of adversary proceedings. In accordance

with _McNeil_, the amendment recognizes that this right is

 offense-specific and, in the context of military law, that it normally attaches

 when charges are preferred. _See United States v. Jordan_,

29 M.J. 177, 187 (C.M.A. 1989); _United States v. Wattenbarger_,

21 M.J. 41 (C.M.A. 1985), _cert. denied_, 477 U.S. 904 (1986).

 Subdivision (e)(2) supersedes the prior notice to counsel rule. The prior

 rule, based on _United States v. McOmber_, 1 M.J. 380 (C.M.A.

 1976), is not consistent with _Minnick_ and _ McNeil

_. Despite the fact that _McOmber_ was decided on

the basis of Article 27, U.C.M.J., the case involved a Sixth Amendment claim

by the defense, an analysis of the Fifth Amendment decisions of _

Miranda v. Arizona_, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and _United States

v. Tempia_,  16 U.S.C.M.A. 629, 37 C.M.R. 249 (1967), and the Sixth

 Amendment decision of _Massiah v. United States_, 377 U.S.

201 (1964). Moreover, the _McOmber_ rule has been applied

to claims based on violations of both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. _

See, e.g. United States v. Fassler_, 29 M.J. 193 (C.M.A. 1989). _

Minnick_ and _McNeil_ reexamine the Fifth and Sixth

Amendment decisions central to the _McOmber_ decision; the

 amendments to subdivision (e) are the result of that reexamination. 

### (f) Exercise of rights.

Rule 305(f) restates prior law in that it requires all questioning

to cease immediately upon the exercise of either the privilege against self-incrimination

or the right to counsel. _See_ _Michigan v. Mosely_,

423 U.S. 96 (1975). The Rule expressly does not deal with the question of

whether or when questioning may be resumed following an exercise of a suspect's

rights and does not necessarily prohibit it. The Committee notes that both

the Supreme Court, _see e.g., Brewer v. Williams_, 480 U.S.

387 (1977); _Michigan v. Mosely_, 423 U.S. 96 (1975), and

the Court of Military Appeals, _see, e.g., United States v. Hill_,

5 M.J. 114 (C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Collier_, 1 M.J.

358 (C.M.A. 1976) have yet to fully resolve this matter. 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ The amendment to subdivision (f) clarifies the distinction

between the rules applicable to the exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination

and the right to counsel. _Michigan v. Mosley_, 423 U.S. 96

(1975). _See also United States v. Hsu_, 852 F.2d 407,

411 n.3 (9th Cir. 1988). The added language, contained in (f)(2), is based on _

Minnick v. Mississippi_, 498 U.S. 146 (1990), and _McNeil

v. Wisconsin_, 501 U.S. 171 (1991).  Consequently, when a suspect

or an accused undergoing interrogation exercises the right to counsel under

circumstances provided for under subdivision (d)(l) of this rule, (f)(2)

applies the rationale of _Minnick_ and _McNeil_ requiring

that questioning must cease until counsel is present. 

### (g) Waiver.

The waiver provision of Rule 305(g) restates current military practice

and is taken in part from Para. 140 _a_(2) of the 1969 Manual. 

 Rule

305(g)(1) sets forth the general rule for waiver and follows _Miranda

v. Arizona_, 384 U.S. 436, 475 (1966). The Rule requires that an

affirmative acknowledgment of the right be made before an adequate waiver

may be found. Thus, three waiver questions are required under Rule 305(g):

**_Do you understand your rights?_**

**_Do you want a lawyer?_**

**_Are you willing to make a statement?_**

The specific wording of the questions is not detailed by the Rule

and any format may be used so long as the substantive content is present.

 Notwithstanding

the above, Rule 305(g)(2), following _North Carolina v. Butler_,

441 U.S. 369 (1979), recognizes that the right to counsel, and only the right

to counsel, may be waived even absent an affirmative declination. The burden

of proof is on the prosecution in such a case to prove by a

preponderance of the evidence that the accused waived the right to counsel.

 The second portion

of Rule 305(g)(2) dealing with notice to counsel is new. The intent behind

the basic notice provision, Rule 305(e), is to give meaning to the right

to counsel by preventing interrogators who know or reasonably should know

an individual has counsel from circumventing the right to counsel by obtaining

a waiver from that person without counsel present. Permitting a Miranda type

waiver in such a situation clearly would defeat the purpose of the Rule.

Rule 305(g)(2) thus permits a waiver of the right to counsel when notice

to counsel is required only if it can be demonstrated either that the counsel,

after reasonable efforts, could not be notified, or that the counsel did

not attend the interrogation which was scheduled within a reasonable period

of time after notice was given. 

 A statement given by an accused

or suspect who can be shown to have his rights as set forth in this Rule

and who intentionally frustrated the diligent attempt of the interrogator

to comply with this Rule shall not be involuntary solely for failure to comply

with the rights warning requirements of this Rule or of the waiver requirements. _

United States v. Sikorski_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 345, 45 C.M.R. 119 (1972). 

 _

1994 Amendment:_ The amendment divided subdivision (2) into three

sections. Subsection (2)(A) remains unchanged from the first sentence of

the previous rule. Subsection (2)(B) is new and conforms military practice

with the Supreme Court's decision in _Minnick v. Mississippi_,

498 U.S. 146 (1990). In that case, the Court provided that an accused or

suspect can validly waive his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, after having

previously exercised that right at an earlier custodial interrogation, by

initiating the subsequent interrogation leading to the waiver. _Id_. at 156.

 This is reflected in subsection (2)(B)(i). Subsection (2)(B)(ii) establishes

a presumption that a coercive atmosphere exists that invalidates a subsequent

waiver of counsel rights when the request for counsel and subsequent waiver

occur while the accused or suspect is in continuous custody. _See

McNeil v. Wisconsin_, 501 U.S. 171 (1991); _ Arizona v. Roberson

_, 486 U.S. 675 (1991). The presumption can be overcome when it

is shown that there occurred a break in custody which sufficiently dissipated

the coercive environment. _See United States v. Schake_, 30

M.J. 314 (C.M.A. 1990). 

 Subsection (2)(C) is also new and conforms

military practice with the Supreme Court's decision in _Michigan v.

Jackson_, 475 U.S. 625, 636 (1986). In _Jackson_,

the Court provided that the accused or suspect can validly waive his or her

Sixth Amendment right to counsel, after having previously asserted that right,

by initiating the subsequent interrogation leading to the waiver. The Court

differentiated between assertions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment right

to counsel by holding that, while exercise of the former barred further interrogation

concerning the same or other offenses in the absence of counsel, the Sixth

Amendment protection only attaches to those offenses as to which the right

was originally asserted. In addition, while continuous custody would serve

to invalidate a subsequent waiver of a Fifth Amendment right to counsel,

the existence or lack of continuous custody is irrelevant to Sixth Amendment

rights. The latter vest once formal proceedings are instituted by the State

and the accused asserts his right to counsel, and they serve to insure that

the accused is afforded the right to counsel to serve as a buffer between

the accused and the State. 

### (h) Non-military interrogations.

Para. 140 _a_(2) of the 1969 Manual, which governed

 civilian interrogations of military personnel basically restated the holding

of _Miranda v. Arizona_, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Recognizing

that the Supreme Court may modify the Miranda rule, the  Committee  has used

the language  in Rule 305(h)(1) to make practice in this area dependent upon

the way the Federal district courts would handle such interrogations. _

See_ Article 36. 

 Rule 305(h)(2) clarifies the law of

interrogations as it relates to interrogations conducted abroad by officials

of a foreign government or their agents when the interrogation is not conducted,

instigated, or participated in by military personnel or their agents. Such

an interrogation does not require rights warnings under subdivisions (c)

or (d) or notice to counsel under subdivision (e). The only test to be applied

in such a case is that of common law voluntariness: whether a statement obtained

during such an interrogation was obtained through the use of "coercion,

unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement." Article 31(d). 

 Whether

an interrogation has been "conducted, instigated, or participated in

by military personnel or their agents" is a question of fact depending

on the circumstances of the case. The Rule makes it clear that a United States

personnel do not participate in an interrogation merely by being present

at the scene of the interrogation, _see_ _United States

v. Jones_, 6 M.J. 226 (C.M.A. 1979) and the Analysis to Rule 311(c),

or by taking steps which are in the best interests of the accused. Also,

an interrogation is not "participated in" by military personnel

or their agents who act as interpreters during the interrogation if there

is no other participation. _See_ Rule 311(c). The omission

of express reference to interpreters in Rule 305(h)(2) was inadvertent.

 _2013 Amendment._ The definition of "person subject to the code" was revised to clarify that it includes a person acting as a knowing agent only in subsection (c). Subsection (c) covers the situation where a person subject to the code is interrogating an accused, and therefore an interrogator would include a knowing agent of a person subject to the code, such as local law enforcement acting at the behest of a military investigator. The term "person subject to the code" is also used in subsection (f), which discusses a situation in which a person subject to the code is being interrogated. If an agent of a person subject to the code is being interrogated, subsection (f) is inapplicable, unless that agent himself is subject to the code and is suspected of an offense.

 The definition of "custodial interrogation" was moved to subsection (b) from subsection (d) in order to co-locate the definitions. The definition is derived from _Miranda v. Arizona_, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966), and _Berkemer v. McCarty_, 468 U.S. 420, 442 (1984).

 "Accused" is defined as "[a] person against whom legal proceedings have been initiated." _Black's Law Dictionary_ 23 (8th ed. 2004). "Suspect" is defined as "[a] person believed to have committed a crime or offense."  _Id._ at 1486. In subsection (c)(1), the word "accused" is used in the first sentence because the rule generally addresses the admissibility of a statement at a court-martial, at which legal proceedings have been initiated against the individual. Throughout the remainder of the rule, "accused" and "suspect" are used together to elucidate that an interrogation that triggers the need for Article 31 warnings will often take place before the individual has become an accused and is still considered only a suspect.

 Although not specifically outlined in subsection (c), the committee intends that interrogators and investigators fully comply with the requirements of _Miranda_. When a suspect is subjected to custodial interrogation, the prosecution may not use statements stemming from that custodial interrogation unless it demonstrates that the suspect was warned of his rights. 384 U.S. at 444. At a minimum, Miranda requires that "the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed. The defendant may waive effectuation of these rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently." Id. A person subject to the code who is being interrogated may be entitled to both _Miranda_ warnings and Article 31(b) warnings, depending on the circumstances.

 The committee recommended changing the titles of subsections (c)(2) and (c)(3) to "Fifth Amendment Right to Counsel" and "Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel" respectively because practitioners are more familiar with those terms. In previous editions, the subsections did not expressly state which right was implicated. Although the rights were clear from the text of the former rules, the new titles will allow practitioners to quickly find the desired rule.

 Subsection (c)(3) is entitled "Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel" even though the protections of subsection (c)(3) exceed the constitutional minimal standard established by the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court in _Montejo v. Louisiana_, 556 U.S. 778 (2009). In _Montejo_, the Court overruled its holding in _Michigan v. Jackson_, 475 U.S. 625 (1986), and held that a defendant's request for counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding or an appointment of counsel by the court does not give rise to the presumption that a subsequent waiver by the defendant during a police-initiated interrogation is invalid. 556 U.S. at 797-98. In the military system, defense counsel is detailed to a court-martial. R.C.M. 501(b). The accused need not affirmatively request counsel. Under the Supreme Court's holding in _Montejo_, the detailing of defense counsel would not bar law enforcement from initiating an interrogation with the accused and seeking a waiver of the right to have counsel present. However, subsection (c)(3) provides more protection than the Supreme Court requires. Under this subsection, if an accused is represented by counsel, either detailed or retained, he or she may not be interrogated without the presence of counsel. This is true even if, during the interrogation, the accused waives his right to have counsel present. If charges have been preferred but counsel has not yet been detailed or retained, the accused may be interrogated if he voluntarily waives his right to have counsel present.

 The words "after such request" were added to subsection (c)(2) to elucidate that any statements made prior to a request for counsel are admissible, assuming, of course, that Article 31(b) rights were given. Without that phrase, the rule could be read to indicate that all statements made during the interview, even those made prior to the request, were inadmissible. This was not the intent of the committee and therefore the change was necessary.

 The word "shall" was changed to "will" in subsections (a), (d), and (f) in accordance with the approach of the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules to minimize the use of "shall" because of the potential disparity in application and interpretation of whether the word is precatory or prescriptive.

In subsection (e)(1), the committee recommended retaining the requirement that the accused's waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination and the waiver of the right to counsel must be affirmative. This rule exceeds the minimal constitutional requirement. In _Berghuis v. Thompkins_, 560 U.S. 370 (2010), the defendant remained mostly silent during a three-hour interrogation and never verbally stated that he wanted to invoke his rights to counsel and to remain silent. The Supreme Court held that the prosecution did not need to show that the defendant expressly waived his rights, and that an implicit waiver is sufficient. _Berghuis_, 560 U.S. at 384. Despite the Supreme Court's holding, under this rule, in order for a waiver to be valid, the accused or suspect must actually take affirmative action to waive his rights. The committee recognizes that this rule places a greater burden on the government to show that the waiver is valid, and it was the intent of the committee to provide more protection to the accused or suspect than is required under the _Berghuis_ holding.

 In subsection (f)(2), the committee recommended replacing the word "abroad" with "outside of a state, district, commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States" in order to clearly define where the rule regarding foreign interrogations applies.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 306. Statements by one of several accused

Rule 306 is taken from the Para. 140 _

 b_ of the 1969 Manual and states the holding of _Bruton v.

 United States_, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). The remainder of the associated

 material in the Manual is primarily concerned with the co-conspirator's

exception to the hearsay rule and has been superseded by adoption of the

Federal Rules of Evidence. _See_ Rule 801. 

 When

it is impossible to effectively delete all references to a co-accused, alternative

steps must be taken to protect the co-accused. This may include the granting

of a severance. 

 The Committee was aware of the Supreme Court's

decision in _ Parker v. Randolph_, 442 U.S. 62 (1979) dealing

with interlocking confessions. In view of the lack of a consensus in _Parker_,

however, the Committee determined that the case did not provide a sufficiently

precise basis for drafting a rule, and decided instead to apply _Bruton_ to

interlocking confessions. 

## Rule 311. Evidence obtained from unlawful searches and seizures

 Rules 311-317 express the manner in which the Fourth

 Amendment to the Constitution of the United States applies to trials by

court-martial,_ Cf. Parker v. Levy_, 417 U.S. 733 (1974).

### (a) General rule.

Rule 311(a) restates the basic exclusionary rule for evidence obtained

from an unlawful search or seizure and is taken generally from Para. 152

of the 1969 Manual although much of the language of Para. 152 has been deleted

for purposes of both clarity and brevity. The Rule requires suppression of

derivative as well as primary evidence and follows the 1969 Manual rule by

 expressly limiting exclusion of evidence to that resulting from unlawful

 searches and seizures involving governmental activity. Those persons whose

 actions may thus give rise to exclusion are listed in Rule 311(c) and are

taken generally from Para. 152 with some expansion for purposes of clarity.

Rule 311 recognizes that discovery of evidence may be so unrelated to an

unlawful search or seizure as to escape exclusion because it was not "obtained

as a result" of that search or seizure. 

 The Rule recognizes

that searches and seizures are distinct acts the legality of which must be

determined independently. Although a seizure will usually be unlawful if

it follows an unlawful search, a seizure may be unlawful even if preceded

by a lawful search. Thus, adequate cause to seize may be distinct from legality

of the search or observations which preceded it. Note in this respect Rule

316(d)(4)(C), Plain View. 

#### (1) Objection.

Rule 311(a)(1) requires that a motion to suppress or, as appropriate,

 an objection be made before evidence can be suppressed. Absent such motion

or objection, the issue is waived. Rule 311(i). 

#### (2) Adequate interest.

Rule 311(a)(2) represents a complete redrafting of the standing

 requirements found in Para. 152 of the 1969 Manual. The Committee viewed

the Supreme Court decision in _Rakas v. Illinois_, 439 U.S.

128 (1978), as substantially modifying the Manual language. Indeed, the very

use of the term "standing" was considered obsolete by a majority

of the Committee. The Rule distinguishes between searches and seizure. To

have sufficient interest to challenge a search, a person must have "a

 reasonable expectation of privacy in the person, place, or property searched."

"Reasonable expectation of privacy" was used in lieu of "legitimate

expectation of privacy," often used in _ Rakas, supra_,

as the Committee believed the two expressions to be identical. The Committee

also considered that the expression "reasonable expectation"

has a more settled meaning. Unlike the case of a search, an individual must

have an interest distinct from an expectation of privacy to challenge a seizure.

When a seizure is involved rather than a search the only invasion of one's

rights is the removal of the property in question. Thus, there must be some

recognizable right to the property seized. Consequently, the Rule requires

a "legitimate interest in the property or evidence seized." This

will normally mean some form of possessory interest. Adequate interest to

challenge a seizure does not _per se_ give adequate interest

to challenge a prior search that may have resulted in the seizure. 

 The

Rule also recognizes an accused's rights to challenge a search or seizure

when the right to do so would exist under the Constitution. Among other reasons,

this provision was included because of the Supreme Court's decision in _

Jones v. United States_, 302 U.S. 257 (1960), which created what

has been termed the "automatic standing rule." The viability

of _Jones_ after _Rakas_ and other cases is

unclear, and the Rule will apply _Jones_ only to the extent

that _Jones_ is constitutionally mandated. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ The words "including seizures of the person"

were added to expressly apply the exclusionary rule to unlawful apprehensions

and arrests, that is, seizures of the person. Procedures governing apprehensions

and arrests are contained in R.C.M. 302. _See also_ Mil. R.

Evid. 316(c). 

### (b) Exceptions:

Rule 311(b) states the holding of _Walder v. United States

_, 347 U.S. 62 (1954), and restates with minor change the rule as

 found in Para. 152 of the 1969 Manual. 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ Rule 311(b)(2) was added to incorporate the "inevitable discovery"

exception to the exclusionary rule of _Nix v. Williams_, 467

U.S. 431 (1984). There is authority for the proposition that this exception

applies to the primary evidence tainted by an illegal search or seizure,

as well as to evidence derived secondarily from a prior illegal search or

seizure. _ United States v. Romero_, 692 F.2d 699 (10th Cir.

1982), _cited with approval in Nix v. Williams, supra_, 467

U.S. 431, n.2. _ See also United States v. Kozak_, 12 M.J.

389 (C.M.A. 1982); _ United States v. Yandell_, 13 M.J. 616

(A.F.C.M.R. 1982). _ Contra, United States v. Ward_, 19 M.J.

505 (A.F.C.M.R. 1984). There is also authority for the proposition that the

prosecution must demonstrate that the lawful means which made discovery inevitable

were possessed by the investigative authority and were being actively pursued

prior to the occurrence of the illegal conduct which results in discovery

of the evidence (_United States v. Satterfield_, 743 F.2d

827, 846 (11th Cir. 1984)). 

 As a logical extension of the holdings

in _Nix_ and _United States v. Kozak, supra_,

the leading military case, the inevitable discovery exception should also

apply to evidence derived from apprehensions and arrests determined to be

illegal under R.C.M. 302 (_State v. Nagel_, 308 N.W.2d 539

(N.D. 1981) (alternative holding)). The prosecution may prove that, notwithstanding

the illegality of the apprehension or arrest, evidence derived therefrom

is admissible under the inevitable discovery exception. 

 Rule

311(b)(3) was added in 1986 to incorporate the "good faith" exception

to the exclusionary rule based on _United States v. Leon_,

468 U.S. 897 (1984) and _Massachusetts v. Sheppard_, 468 U.S.

981 (1984). The exception applies to search warrants and authorizations to

search or seize issued by competent civilian authority, military judges,

military magistrates, and commanders. The test for determining whether the

applicant acted in good faith is whether a reasonably well-trained law enforcement

officer would have known the search or seizure was illegal despite the authorization.

In _Leon_ and _ Sheppard_, the applicant's good

faith was enhanced by their prior consultation with attorneys. 

 The

rationale articulated in _Leon_ and _ Sheppard_ that

the deterrence basis of the exclusionary rule does not apply to magistrates

extends with equal force to search or seizure authorizations issued by commanders

who are neutral and detached, as defined in _United States v. Ezell

_, 6 M.J. 307 (C.M.A. 1979). The United States Court of Military

Appeals demonstrated in _United States v. Stuckey_, 10 M.J.

347 (C.M.A. 1981), that commanders cannot be equated constitutionally to

magistrates. As a result, commanders' authorizations may be closely scrutinized

for evidence of neutrality in deciding whether this exception will apply.

In a particular case, evidence that the commander received the advice of

a judge advocate prior to authorizing the search or seizure may be an important

consideration. Other considerations may include those enumerated in _

Ezell_ and: the level of command of the authorizing commander; whether

the commander had training in the rules relating to search and seizure; whether

the rule governing the search or seizure being litigated was clear; whether

the evidence supporting the authorization was given under oath; whether the

authorization was reduced to writing; and whether the defect in the authorization

was one of form or substance. 

 As a logical extension of the holdings

in _Leon_ and _Sheppard_, the good faith exception

also applies to evidence derived from apprehensions and arrests which are

effected pursuant to an authorization or warrant, but which are subsequently

determined to have been defective under R.C.M. 302 (_United States

v. Mahoney_, 712 F.2d 956 (5th Cir. 1983); _United States

v. Beck_, 729 F.2d 1329 (11th Cir. 1984)). The authorization or warrant

must, however, meet the conditions set forth in Rule 311(b)(3). 

 It

is intended that the good faith exception will apply to both primary and

derivative evidence. 

### (c) Nature of search or seizure.

Rule 311(c) defines "unlawful" searches and seizures

and makes it clear that the treatment of a search or seizure varies depending

on the status of the individual or group conducting the search or seizure.

#### (1) Military personnel.

Rule 311(c)(1) generally restates prior law. A violation of a military

regulation alone will not require exclusion of any resulting evidence. However,

a violation of such a regulation that gives rise to a reasonable expectation

of privacy may require exclusion. _Compare United States v. Dillard

_, 8 M.J. 213 (C.M.A. 1980), with _United States v. Caceres

_, 440 U.S. 741 (1979). 

#### (2) Other officials.

Rule 311(c)(2) requires that the legality of a search or seizure

 performed by officials of the United States, of the District of Columbia,

or of a state, commonwealth, or possession or political subdivision thereof,

be determined by the principles of law applied by the United States district

 courts when resolving the legality of such a search or seizure. 

#### (3) Officials of a foreign government or their agents.

 This provision is taken in part from _United States v.

Jordan_, 1 M.J. 334 (C.M.A. 1976). After careful analysis, a majority

 of the Committee concluded that portion of the _Jordan_ opinion

 which purported to require that such foreign searches be shown to have complied

 with foreign law is dicta and lacks any specific legal authority to support

it. Further the Committee noted the fact that most foreign nations lack any

law of search and seizure and that in some cases, _e.g._,

Germany, such law as may exist is purely theoretical and not subject to determination.

The _Jordan_ requirement thus unduly complicates trial without

 supplying any protection to the accused. Consequently, the Rule omits the

 requirement in favor of a basic due process test. In determining which version

 of the various due process phrasings to utilize, a majority of the Committee

 chose to use the language found in Para. 150 _b_ of the 1969

 Manual rather than the language found in _Jordan_ (which

requires that the evidence not shock the conscience of the court) believing

the Manual language is more appropriate to the circumstances involved. 

 Rule

311(c) also indicates that persons who are present at a foreign search or

seizure conducted in a foreign nation have "not participated in"

that search or seizure due either to their mere presence or because of any

actions taken to mitigate possible damage to property or person. The Rule

thus clarifies _United States v. Jordan_, 1 M.J. 334 (C.M.A.

1976) which stated that the Fourth Amendment would be applicable to searches

and seizures conducted abroad by foreign police when United States personnel

participate in them. The Court's intent in _ Jordan_ was to

prevent American authorities from sidestepping Constitutional protections

by using foreign personnel to conduct a search or seizure that would have

been unlawful if conducted by Americans. This intention is safeguarded by

the Rule, which applies the Rules and the Fourth Amendment when military

personnel or their agents conduct, instigate, or participate in a search

or seizure. The Rule only clarifies the circumstances in which a United States

official will be deemed to have participated in a foreign search or seizure.

This follows dicta in _United States v. Jones_, 6 M.J. 226,

230 (C.M.A. 1979), which would require an "element of causation,"

rather than mere presence. It seems apparent that an American servicemember

is far more likely to be well served by United States presence- which

might mitigate foreign conduct- than by its absence. Further, international

treaties frequently require United States cooperation with foreign law enforcement.

Thus, the Rule serves all purposes by prohibiting conduct by United States

officials which might improperly support a search or seizure which would

be unlawful if conducted in the United States while protecting both the accused

and international relations. 

 The Rule also permits use of United

States personnel as interpreters viewing such action as a neutral activity

normally of potential advantage to the accused. Similarly the Rule permits

personnel to take steps to protect the person or property of the accused

because such actions are clearly in the best interests of the accused. 

### (d) Motion to suppress and objections.

Rule 311(d) provides for challenging evidence obtained as a result

of an allegedly unlawful search or seizure. The procedure, normally that

of a motion to suppress, is intended with a small difference in the disclosure

 requirements to duplicate that required by Rule 304(d) for confessions and

 admissions, the Analysis of which is equally applicable here. 

 Rule

311(d)(1) differs from Rule 304(c)(1) in that it is applicable only to evidence

that the prosecution intends to offer against the accused. The broader disclosure

provision for statements by the accused was considered unnecessary. Like

Rule 304(d)(2)(C), Rule 311(d)(2)(C) provides expressly for derivative evidence

disclosure of which is not mandatory as it may be unclear to the prosecution

exactly what is derivative of a search or seizure. The Rule thus clarifies

the situation. 

### (e) Burden of proof.

Rule 311(e) requires that a preponderance of the evidence standard

be used in determining search and seizure questions. _Lego v. Twomey

_, 404 U.S. 477 (1972). Where the validity of a consent to search

 or seize is involved, a higher standard of "clear and convincing,"

 is applied by Rule 314(e). This restates prior law. 

 _

February 1986 Amendment:_ Subparagraphs (e)(1) and (2) were

amended to state the burden of proof for the inevitable discovery and good

faith exceptions to the exclusionary rule, as prescribed in _Nix v.

Williams_, 467 U.S. 431 (1984) and _United States v. Leon

_, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), respectively. 

 1993 Amendment:

The amendment to Mil. R. Evid. 311(e)(2) was made to conform Rule 311 to

the rule of _New York v. Harris_, 495 U.S. 14 (1990). The

purpose behind the exclusion of derivative evidence found during the course

of an unlawful apprehension in a dwelling is to protect the physical integrity

of the dwelling not to protect suspects from subsequent lawful police interrogation. _

See id._ A suspect's subsequent statement made at another location

that is the product of lawful police interrogation is not the fruit of the

unlawful apprehension. The amendment also contains language added to reflect

the "good faith" exception to the exclusionary role set forth

in _United States v. Leon,_ 468 U.S. 897 (1984), and the "inevitable

discovery" exception set forth in _Nix v. Williams,_ 467

U.S. 431 (1984). 

### (f) Defense evidence.

Rule 311(f) restates prior law and makes it clear that although

an accused is sheltered from any use at trial of a statement made while

challenging a search or seizure, such statement may be used in a subsequent

 "prosecution for perjury, false swearing or the making of a false

official statement." 

### (g) Scope of motions and objections challenging probable cause.

Rule 311(g)(2) follows the Supreme Court decision in _Franks

v. Delaware_, 422 U.S. 928 (1978), _see also United States

v. Turck_, 49 C.M.R. 49, 53 (A.F.C.M.R. 1974), with minor modifications

made to adopt the decision to military procedures. Although Franks involved

perjured affidavits by police, Rule 311(a) is made applicable to information

given by government agents because of the governmental status of members

of the armed services. The Rule is not intended to reach misrepresentations

made by informants without any official connection. 

 _1995

Amendment:_ Subsection (g)(2) was amended to clarify that in order

for the defense to prevail on an objection or motion under this rule, it

must establish, _inter alia_, that the falsity of the evidence

was "knowing and intentional" or in reckless disregard for the

truth. _Accord Franks v. Delaware_, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).

### (h) Objections to evidence seized unlawfully.

Rule 311(h) is new and is included for reasons of clarity. 

### (i) Effect of guilty plea.

Rule 311(i) restates prior law. _See, e.g., United States

v. Hamil_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 110, 35 C.M.R. 82 (1964).

 _2013 Amendment._ The definition of "unlawful" was moved from subsection (c) to subsection (b) so that it immediately precedes the subsection in which the term is first used in the rule. Other subsections were moved so that they generally follow the order in which the issues described in the subsections arise at trial. The committee recommended renumbering the subsections accordingly and titling each subsection to make it easier for the practitioner to find the relevant part of the rule. The committee also recommended subsuming former subsection (d)(2)(c), addressing a motion to suppress derivative evidence, into subsection (d)(1) because a motion to suppress seized evidence must follow the same procedural requirements as a motion to suppress derivative evidence.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 312. Body views and intrusions

_1984 Amendment:_ "Body" was substituted

for "bodily" in the title and where appropriate in text. _

See United States v. Armstrong_, 9 M.J. 374, 378 n.5 (C.M.A. 1980).

### (a) General rule.

Rule 312(a) limits all nonconsensual inspections, searches, or

seizures by providing standards for examinations of the naked body and bodily

 intrusions. An inspection, search, or seizure that would be lawful but for

 noncompliance with this Rule is unlawful within the meaning of Rule 311.

### (b) Visual examination of the body.

Rule 312(b) governs searches and examinations of the naked body

and thus controls what has often been loosely termed "strip searches."

 Rule 312(b) permits visual examination of the naked body in a wide but finite

 range of circumstances. In doing so, the Rule strictly distinguishes between

 visual examination of body cavities and actual intrusion into them. Intrusion

 is governed by Rule 312(c) and (e). Visual examination of the male genitals

is permitted when a visual examination is permissible under this subdivision.

 Examination of cavities may include, when otherwise proper under the Rule,

 requiring the individual being viewed to assist in the examination. 

 Examination

of body cavities within the prison setting has been vexatious. _See,

e.g., Hanley v. Ward_, 584 F.2d 609 (2d Cir. 1978); _Wolfish

v. Levi_, 573 F.2d 118, 131 (2d Cir. 1978), _reversed sub

nom Bell v. Wolfish_, 441 U.S. 520 (1979); _ Daughtry v. Harris

_, 476 F.2d 292 (10th Cir. 1973), _cert. denied_,

414 U.S. 872 (1973); _Frazier v. Ward_, 426 F.Supp. 1354,

1362-67 (N.D.N.Y. 1977); _Hodges v. Klein_, 412 F.Supp.

896 (D.N.J. 1976). Institutional security must be protected while at the

same time only privacy intrusions necessary should be imposed on the individual.

The problem is particularly acute in this area of inspection of body cavities

as such strong social taboos are involved. Rule 312(b)(2) allows examination

of body cavities when reasonably necessary to maintain the security of the

institution or its personnel. _See Bell v. Wolfish_, 441 U.S.

520 (1979). Examinations likely to be reasonably necessary include examination

upon entry or exit from the institution, examination subsequent to a personal

visit, or examination pursuant to a reasonably clear indication that the

individual is concealing property within a body cavity. _Frazier v.

Ward_, 426 F.Supp. 1354 (N.D.N.Y. 1977); _Hodges v. Klein

_, 412 F.Supp. 896 (D.N.J. 1976). Great deference should be given

to the decisions of the commanders and staff of military confinement facilities.

The concerns voiced by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in _

Daughtry v. Harris_, 476 F.2d 292 (10th Cir. 1973) about escape and

related risks are likely to be particularly applicable to military prisoners

because of their training in weapons and escape and evasion tactics. 

 As

required throughout Rule 312, examination of body cavities must be accomplished

in a reasonable fashion. This incorporates _Rochin v. California_,

342 U.S. 165 (1952), and recognizes society's particularly sensitive attitude

in this area. Where possible, examination should be made in private and by

members of the same sex as the person being examined. 

 _

1984 Amendment:_ In subsection (b)(2) and (c), "reasonable"

replaced "real" before "suspicion." A majority of

Circuit Courts of Appeal have adopted a "reasonable suspicion"

test over a "real suspicion" test. _See United States

v. Klein_, 592 F.2d 909 (5th Cir. 1979); _United States v.

Asbury_, 586 F.2d 973 (2d Cir. 1978); _United States v. Wardlaw

_, 576 F.2d 932 (1st Cir. 1978); _United States v. Himmelwright

_, 551 F.2d 991 (5th Cir.), _cert. denied_, 434 U.S.

902 (1977). _But see United States v. Aman_, 624 F.2d 911

(9th Cir. 1980). In practice, the distinction may be minimal. _But

see Perel v. Vanderford_, 547 F.2d 278, 280 n.1 (5th Cir. 1977).

However, the real suspicion formulation has been criticized as potentially

confusing. _United States v. Asbury, supra_ at 976. 

### (c) Intrusion into body cavities.

Actual intrusion into body cavities, _e.g._, the

anus and vagina, may represent both a significant invasion of the individual's

 privacy and a possible risk to the health of the individual. Rule 312(c)

allows seizure of property discovered in accordance with Rules 312(b), 312(c)(2),

or 316(d)(4)(C) but requires that intrusion into such cavities be accomplished

by personnel with appropriate medical qualifications. The Rule thus does

not specifically require that the intrusion be made by a doctor, nurse, or

other similar medical personnel although Rule 312(g) allows the Secretary

concerned to prescribe who may perform such procedures. It is presumed that

an object easily located by sight can normally be easily extracted. The requirements

for appropriate medical qualifications, however, recognize that circumstances

may require more qualified personnel. This may be particularly true, for

example, for extraction of foreign matter from a pregnant woman's vagina.

Intrusion should normally be made either by medical personnel or by persons

with appropriate medical qualifications who are members of the same sex as

the person involved. 

 The Rule distinguishes between seizure of

property previously located and intrusive searches of body cavities by requiring

in Rule 312(c)(2) that such searches be made only pursuant to a search warrant

or authorization, based upon probable cause, and conducted by persons with

appropriate medical qualifications. Exigencies do not permit such searches

without warrant or authorization unless Rule 312(f) is applicable. In the

absence of express regulations issued by the Secretary concerned pursuant

to Rule 312(g), the determination as to which personnel are qualified to

conduct an intrusion should be made in accordance with normal procedures

of the applicable medical facility. 

 Recognizing the peculiar

needs of confinement facilities and related institutions, _see, e.g.,

Bell v. Wolfish_, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), Rule 312(c) authorizes body

cavity searches without prior search warrant or authorization when there

is a "real suspicion that the individual is concealing weapons, contraband,

or evidence of crime." 

### (d) Extraction of body fluids.

Seizure of fluids from the body may involve self-incrimination

questions pursuant to Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

and appropriate case law should be consulted prior to involuntary seizure. _

 See generally_ Rule 301(a) and its Analysis. The Committee does not

 intend an individual's expelled breath to be within the definition of "body

fluids." 

 The 1969 Manual Para. 152 authorization for seizure

of bodily fluids when there has been inadequate time to obtain a warrant

or authorization has been slightly modified. The prior language that there

be "clear indication that evidence of crime will be found and that

there is reason to believe that delay will threaten the destruction of evidence"

has been modified to authorize such a seizure if there is reason to believe

that the delay "could result in the destruction of the evidence."

Personnel involuntarily extracting bodily fluids must have appropriate medical

 qualifications. 

 Rule 312 does not prohibit compulsory urinalysis,

whether random or not, made for appropriate medical purposes, _see

_ Rule 312(f), and the product of such a procedure if otherwise admissible

may be used in evidence at a court-martial. 

 _1984 Amendment:

_ The first word in the caption of subsection (d) was changed from

"_Seizure_" to "_ Extraction_."

This is consistent with the text of subsection (d) and should avoid possible

confusion about the scope of the subsection. Subsection (d) does not apply

to compulsory production of body fluids (_e.g.,_ being ordered

to void urine), but rather to physical extraction of body fluids (e.g., catheterization

or withdrawal of blood). _See Murray v. Haldeman_, 16 M.J.

74 (C.M.A. 1983). _See also_ Analysis, Mil. R. Evid. 313(b).

### (e) Other intrusive searches.

The intrusive searches governed by Rule 312(e) will normally involve

 significant medical procedures including surgery and include any intrusion

into the body including x-rays. Applicable civilian cases lack a unified

approach to surgical intrusions, _see, e.g., United States v. Crowder

_, 513 F.2d 395 (D.C. Cir. 1976); _Adams v. State_,

299 N.E.2d 834 (Ind. 1973); _Creamer v. State_, 299 Ga. 511,

192 S.E.2d 350 (1972), Note, _Search and Seizure: Compelled Surgical

Intrusion_, 27 Baylor L. Rev. 305 (1975), and cases cited therein,

other than to rule out those intrusions which are clearly health threatening.

Rule 312(e) balances the Government's need for evidence with the individual's

privacy interest by allowing intrusion into the body of an accused or suspect

upon search authorization or warrant when conducted by person with "appropriate

 medical qualification," and by prohibiting intrusion when it will

endanger the health of the individual. This allows, however, considerable

 flexibility and leaves the ultimate issue to be determined under a due process

 standard of reasonableness. As the public's interest in obtaining evidence

from an individual other than an accused or suspect is substantially less

than the person's right to privacy in his or her body, the Rule prohibits

the involuntary intrusion altogether if its purpose is to obtain evidence

of crime. 

### (f) Intrusions for valid medical purposes.

Rule 312(f) makes it clear that the Armed Forces retain their power

 to ensure the health of their members. A procedure conducted for valid medical

 purposes may yield admissible evidence. Similarly, Rule 312 does not affect

in any way any procedure necessary for diagnostic or treatment purposes.

### (g) Medical qualifications.

Rule 312(g) permits but does not require the Secretaries concerned

to prescribe the medical qualifications necessary for persons to conduct

the procedures and examinations specified in the Rule.

 _2013 Amendment._ The last sentence of former subsection (b)(2) was moved to a discussion paragraph because it addresses the conduct of the examiner rather than the admissibility of evidence. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. Failure to comply with the requirement that a person of the same sex conduct the examination does not make the examination unlawful or the evidence inadmissible.

 In subsection (c)(2)(a), the words "clear indication" were replaced with "probable cause" because the committee determined that "clear indication" was not well-understood by practitioners nor properly defined in case law, whereas "probable cause" is a recognized Fourth Amendment term. The use of the phrase "clear indication" likely came from the Supreme Court's holding in _Schmerber v. California_, 384 U.S. 757 (1966). In that case, the Court stated: "In the absence of a clear indication that in fact such evidence will be found, these fundamental human interests require law officers to suffer the risk that such evidence may disappear unless there is an immediate search." _Id._ at 770. However, in _United States v. Montoya de Hernandez_, 473 U.S. 531 (1985), the Supreme Court clarified that it did not intend to create a separate Fourth Amendment standard when it used the words "clear indication." _Id._ at 540 ("[W]e think that the words in Schmerber were used to indicate the necessity for particularized suspicion that the evidence sought might be found within the body of the individual, rather than as enunciating still a third Fourth Amendment threshold between 'reasonable suspicion' and 'probable cause.'"). The committee decided that the appropriate standard for a search under subsection (c)(2)(a) is probable cause. The committee made this decision with the understanding that the President's adoption of the probable cause standard would raise the level of suspicion required to perform a search under this subsection beyond that which was required in previous versions of this rule. The same reasoning applies to the change in subsection (d), where the committee also recommended replacing the words "clear indication" with "probable cause." This approach is consistent with the Court of Military Appeals' opinion in _United States v. Bickel_, 30 M.J. 277, 279 (C.M.A. 1990) ("We have no doubt as to the constitutionality of such searches and seizures based on probable cause").

 In subsection (d), the committee recommended replacing the term "involuntary" with "nonconsensual" for the sake of consistency and uniformity throughout the subsection. The committee did not intend to change the rule in any practical way by using "nonconsensual" in the place of "involuntary."

 A discussion paragraph was added following subsection (e) to address a situation in which a person is compelled to ingest a substance in order to locate property within that person's body. This paragraph was previously found in subsection (e), and the committee recommended removing it from the rule itself because it addresses conduct rather than the admissibility of evidence. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis.

 The committee recommended adding the last line of subsection (f) to conform the rule to CAAF's holding in _United States v. Stevenson_, 66 M.J. 15 (C.A.A.F. 2008). In _Stevenson_, the court held that any additional intrusion, beyond what is necessary for medical treatment, is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 19 ("the Supreme Court has not adopted a de minimis exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement"). The committee recommended moving the first line of former subsection (f) to a discussion paragraph because it addresses conduct rather than the admissibility of evidence, and is therefore more appropriately addressed in a discussion paragraph. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 313. Inspections and inventories in the armed forces

 Although inspections have long been recognized as being necessary

and legitimate exercises of a commander's powers and responsibilities, _

see, e.g., United States v. Gebhart_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 606, 610 n.2,

28 C.M.R. 172, 176 n.2 (1959), the 1969 Manual for Courts-Martial omitted

discussion of inspections except to note that the Para. 152 restrictions

on seizures were not applicable to "administrative inspections."

The reason for the omission is likely that military inspections _

per se_ have traditionally been considered administrative in nature

and free of probable cause requirements. _Cf. Frank v. Maryland_,

359 U.S. 360 (1959). Inspections that have been utilized as subterfuge searches

have been condemned. _See, e.g., United States v. Lange_,

15 U.S.C.M.A. 486, 35 C.M.R. 458 (1965). Recent decisions of the United States

Court of Military Appeals have attempted, generally without success, to define

"inspection" for Fourth Amendment evidentiary purposes, _

see, e.g., United States v. Thomas_, 1 M.J. 397 (C.M.A. 1976)

(three separate opinions), and have been concerned with the intent,

scope, and method of conducting inspections. _See e.g., United States

v. Harris_, 5 M.J. 44 (C.M.A. 1978). 

### (a) General rule.

 

 Rule 313 codifies the law of military inspections and

inventories. Traditional terms used to describe various inspections, _

e.g._ "shakedown inspection" or "gate search,"

have been abandoned as being conducive to confusion. 

 Rule 313

does not govern inspections or inventories not conducted within the armed

forces. These civilian procedures must be evaluated under Rule 311(c)(2).

In general, this means that such inspections and inventories need only be

permissible under the Fourth Amendment in order to yield evidence admissible

at a court-martial. 

 Seizure of property located pursuant to a

proper inspection or inventory must meet the requirements of Rule 316. 

### (b) Inspections.

Rule 313(b) defines "inspection" as an

"examination. . . conducted as an incident of command the primary purpose of which

is to determine and to ensure the security, military fitness, or good order

and discipline of the unit, organization, installation, vessel, aircraft,

or vehicle." Thus, an inspection is conducted for the primary function

of ensuring mission readiness, and is a function of the inherent duties and

 responsibilities of those in the military chain of command. Because inspections

 are intended to discover, correct, and deter conditions detrimental to military

 efficiency and safety, they must be considered as a condition precedent to

the existence of any effective armed force and inherent in the very concept

of a military unit. Inspections as a general legal concept have their constitutional

 origins in the very provisions of the Constitution which authorize the armed

 forces of the United States. Explicit authorization for inspections has thus

 been viewed in the past as unnecessary, but in light of the present ambiguous

 state of the law (_see, e.g. United States v. Thomas, supra; United

 States v. Roberts_, 2 M.J. 31 (C.M.A. 1976)), such authorization appears

 desirable. Rule 313 is thus, in addition to its status as a rule of evidence

 authorized by Congress under Article 36, an express Presidential authorization

 for inspections with such authorization being grounded in the President's

 powers as Commander-in-Chief. 

 The interrelationship of inspections

and the Fourth Amendment is complex. The constitutionality of inspections

is apparent and has been well recognized; _see e.g., United States

v. Gebhart_, 10 C.M.A. 606, 610 n.2, 28 C.M.R. 172, 176 n.2. (1959).

There are three distinct rationales which support the constitutionality of

inspections. 

 The first such rationale is that inspections are

not technically "searches"within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. _

Cf. Air Pollution Variance Board v. Western Alfalfa Corps_, 416 U.S.

861 (1974); _Hester v. United States_, 265 U.S. 57 (1924).

The intent of the framers, the language of the amendment itself, and the

nature of military life render the application of the Fourth Amendment to

a normal inspection questionable. As the Supreme Court has often recognized,

the "Military is, [by necessity, a specialized society separate

from civilian society.]" _Brown v. Glines_,

444 U.S. 348, 354 (1980) _citing Parker v. Levy_, 417 U.S.

733, 734 (1974). As the Supreme Court noted in _Glines, supra_,

military personnel must be ready to perform their duty whenever the occasion

arises. To ensure that they always are capable of performing their mission

promptly and reliably, the military services "must insist upon a respect

for duty and a discipline without counterpart in civilian life." 444

U.S. at 354 (citations omitted). An effective armed force without inspections

is impossible- a fact amply illustrated by the unfettered right to

inspect vested in commanders throughout the armed forces of the world. As

recognized in _Glines, supra_, and _Greer v. Spock

_, 424 U.S. 828 (1976), the _way_ that the Bill of

Rights applies to military personnel may be different from the way it applies

to civilians. Consequently, although the Fourth Amendment is applicable to

members of the armed forces, inspections may well not be "searches"

within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment by reason of history, necessity,

and constitutional interpretation. If they are "searches," they

are surely reasonable ones, and are constitutional on either or both of two

rationales. 

 As recognized by the Supreme Court, highly regulated

industries are subject to inspection without warrant, _United States

v. Biswell_, 406 U.S. 311 (1972); _Colonnade Catering Corp.

v. United States_, 397 U.S. 72 (1970), both because of the necessity

for such inspections and because of the "limited threats to. . . justifiable

 expectation of privacy." _United States v. Biswell,

 supra_, at 316. The court in _Biswell, supra_, found that regulations

 of firearms traffic involved "large interests," that "inspection

is a crucial part of the regulatory scheme," and that when a firearms

dealer enters the business "he does so with the knowledge that his

business records, firearms, and ammunition will be subject to effective inspection,"

406 U.S. 315, 316. It is clear that inspections within the armed forces are

at least as important as regulation of firearms; that without such inspections

effective regulation of the armed forces is impossible; and that all personnel

entering the armed forces can be presumed to know that the reasonable expectation

of privacy within the armed forces is exceedingly limited by comparison with

civilian expectations. _See e.g., Committee for G.I. Rights v. Callaway

_, 518 F.2d 466 (D.C.C. 1975). Under _Colonnade Catering,

supra_, and _Bisell, supra_, inspections are thus reasonable searches

and may be made without warrant. 

 An additional rationale for military

inspection is found within the Supreme Court's other administrative inspection

cases. _See Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc._, 436 U.S. 397 (1978); _

Camara v. Municipal Court_, 387 U.S. 523 (1967); _See v. City

of Seattle_, 387 U.S. 541 (1967). Under these precedents an administrative

inspection is constitutionally acceptable for health and safety purposes

so long as such an inspection is first authorized by warrant. The warrant

involved, however, need not be upon probable cause in the traditional sense,

rather the warrant may be issued "if reasonable legislative or administrative

standards for conducting an area inspection are satisfied. . ." _

Camara, supra_, 387 U.S. at 538. Military inspections are intended

for health and safety reasons in a twofold sense: they protect the health

and safety of the personnel in peacetime in a fashion somewhat analogous

to that which protects the health of those in a civilian environment, and,

by ensuring the presence and proper condition of armed forces personnel,

equipment, and environment, they protect those personnel from becoming unnecessary

casualties in the event of combat. Although _Marshall v. Barlow's

Inc., Camara_, and _See, supra_, require warrants,

the intent behind the warrant requirement is to ensure that the person whose

property is inspected is adequately notified that local law requires inspection,

that the person is notified of the limits of the inspection, and that the

person is adequately notified that the inspector is acting with proper authority. _

Camara v. Municipal Court_, 387 U.S. 523, 532 (1967). Within the

armed forces, the warrant requirement is met automatically if an inspection

is ordered by a commander, as commanders are empowered to grant warrants. _

United States v. Ezell_, 6 M.J. 307 (C.M.A. 1979). More importantly,

the concerns voiced by the court are met automatically within the military

environment in any event as the rank and assignment of those inspecting and

their right to do so are known to all. To the extent that the search warrant

requirements are intended to prohibit inspectors from utilizing inspections

as subterfuge searches, a normal inspection fully meets the concern, and

Rule 313(b) expressly prevents such subterfuges. The fact that an inspection

that is primarily administrative in nature may result in a criminal prosecution

is unimportant. _Camara v. Municipal Court_, 387 U.S. 523,

 530-31 (1967). Indeed, administrative inspections may inherently result

 in prosecutions because such inspections are often intended to discover health

 and safety defects the presence of which are criminal offenses. _

 Id._ at 531. What is important, to the extent that the Fourth Amendment

 is applicable, is protection from unreasonable violations of privacy. Consequently,

Rule 313(b) makes it clear that an otherwise valid inspection is not rendered

invalid solely because the inspector has as his or her purpose a _

secondary_ "purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a trial

by court-martial or in other disciplinary proceedings. . ." An

examination made, however, with a _primary_ purpose of prosecution

is no longer an administrative inspection. Inspections are, as has been previously

discussed, lawful acceptable measures to ensure the survival of the American

armed forces and the accomplishment of their mission. They do not infringe

upon the limited reasonable expectation of privacy held by service personnel.

It should be noted, however, that it is possible for military personnel to

be granted a reasonable expectation of privacy greater than the minimum inherently

recognized by the Constitution. An installation commander might, for example,

declare a BOQ sacrosanct and off limits to inspections. In such a rare case

the reasonable expectation of privacy held by the relevant personnel could

prevent or substantially limit the power to inspect under the Rule. _

See_ Rule 311(c). Such extended expectations of privacy may, however,

be negated with adequate notice. 

 An inspection "may be made

'of the whole or part' of a unit, organization, installation,

vessel, aircraft, or vehicle. . . (and is) conducted as an incident of command."

Inspections are usually quantitative examinations insofar as they do not

normally single out specific individuals or small groups of individuals.

There is, however, no requirement that the entirety of a unit or organization

be inspected. Unless authority to do so has been withheld by competent superior

authority, any individual placed in a command or appropriate supervisory

position may inspect the personnel and property within his or her control. 

 Inspections

for contraband such as drugs have posed a major problem. Initially, such

inspections were viewed simply as a form of health and welfare inspection, _

see, e.g., United States v. Unrue_, 22 C.M.A. 466, 47 C.M.R. 556

(1973). More recently, however, the Court of Military Appeals has tended

to view them solely as searches for evidence of crime. _See e.g. United

States v. Roberts_, 2 M.J. 31 (C.M.A. 1976); _but see United

States v. Harris_, 5 M.J. 44, 58 (C.M.A. 1978). Illicit drugs, like

unlawful weapons, represent, however, a potential threat to military efficiency

of disastrous proportions. Consequently, it is entirely appropriate to treat

inspections intended to rid units of contraband that would adversely affect

military fitness as being health and welfare inspections, _see, e.g.,

Committee for G.I. Rights v. Callaway_, 518 F.2d 466 (D.C.C. 1975),

and the Rule does so. 

 A careful analysis of the applicable case

law, military and civilian, easily supports this conclusion. Military cases

have long recognized the legitimacy of "health and welfare" inspections

and have defined those inspections as examinations intended to ascertain

and ensure the readiness of personnel and equipment. _See, e.g., United

States v. Gebhart_, 10 C.M.A. 606, 610 n.2, 28 C.M.R. 172, 176 n.2

(1959); "(these) types of searches are not to be confused with inspections

of military personnel. . . conducted by a commander in furtherance of

the security of his command"; _United States v. Brashears_,

45 C.M.R. 438 (A.C.M.R. 1972), _rev'd on other grounds_, 21

C.M.A. 522, 45 C.M.R. 326 (1972). Among the legitimate intents of a proper

inspection is the location and confiscation of unauthorized weapons. _

See, e.g., United States v. Grace_, 19 C.M.A. 409, 410, 42 C.M.R.

11, 12 (1970). The justification for this conclusion is clear: unauthorized

weapons are a serious danger to the health of military personnel and therefore

to mission readiness. Contraband that "would affect adversely the security,

military fitness, or good order and discipline" is thus identical with

 unauthorized weapons insofar as their effects can be predicted. Rule 313(b)

 authorizes inspections for contraband, and is expressly intended to authorize

 inspections for unlawful drugs. As recognized by the Court of Military Appeals

 in _United States v. Unrue_, 22 C.M.A. 466, 469-70,

47 C.M.R. 556, 559-60 (1973), unlawful drugs pose unique problems.

If uncontrolled, they may create an "epidemic," 47 C.M.R. at

559. Their use is not only contagious as peer pressure in barracks, aboard

ship, and in units, tends to impel the spread of improper drug use, but the

effects are known to render units unfit to accomplish their missions. Viewed

in this light, it is apparent that inspection for those drugs which would

"affect adversely the security, military fitness, or good order and

discipline of the command" is a proper administrative intent well within

the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. _See, e.g., Camara

v. Municipal Court_, 387 U.S. 523 (1967); _United States v.

Unrue_, 22 C.M.A. 446, 471, 47 C.M.R. 556, 561 (1973) (Judge Duncan

dissenting). This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that members of the

military have a diminished expectation of privacy, and that inspections for

such contraband are "reasonable" within the meaning of the Fourth

Amendment. _ See, e.g., Committee for G.I. Rights v. Callaway_,

518 F.2d 466 (D.C.C. 1975). Although there are a number of decisions of

the Court of Military Appeals that have called the legality of inspections

for unlawful drugs into question, _see United States v. Thomas, supra;

United States v. Roberts_, 2 M.J. 31 (C.M.A. 1977), those decisions

with their multiple opinions are not dispositive. Particularly important

to this conclusion is the opinion of Judge Perry in _United States

v. Roberts, supra._ Three significant themes are present in the opinion:

lack of express authority for such inspections, the perception that unlawful

drugs are merely evidence of crime, and the high risk that inspections may

be used for subterfuge searches. The new Rule is intended to resolve these

matters fully. The Rule, as part of an express Executive Order, supplies

the explicit authorization for inspections then lacking. Secondly, the Rule

is intended to make plain the fact that an inspection that has as its object

the prevention and correction of conditions harmful to readiness is far more

than a hunt for evidence. Indeed, it is the express judgment of the Committee

that the uncontrolled use of unlawful drugs within the armed forces creates

a readiness crisis and that continued use of such drugs is totally incompatible

with the possibility of effectively fielding military forces capable of accomplishing

their assigned mission. Thirdly, Rule 313(b) specifically deals with the

subterfuge question in order to prevent improper use of inspections. 

 Rule

313(b) requires that before an inspection intended "to locate and confiscate

unlawful weapons or other contraband, that would affect adversely

the. . . command" may take place, there must be either "a reasonable suspicion

that such property is present in the command" or the inspection must

be "a previously scheduled examination of the command." The former

requirement requires that an inspection not previously scheduled be justified

by "reasonable suspicion that such property is present in the command."

This standard is intentionally minimal and requires only that the person

ordering the inspection have a suspicion that is, under the circumstances,

reasonable in nature. Probable cause is not required. Under the latter requirement,

an inspection shall be scheduled sufficiently far enough in advance as to

eliminate any reasonable probability that the inspection is being used as

a subterfuge, _ i.e._, that it is being used to search a given

individual for evidence of crime when probable cause is lacking. Such scheduling

may be made as a matter of date or event. In other words, inspections may

be scheduled to take place on any specific date, _e.g._, a

commander may decide on the first of a month to inspect on the 7th, 9th,

and 21st, or on the occurrence of a specific event beyond the usual control

of the commander, _ e.g._, whenever an alert is ordered, forces

are deployed, a ship sails, the stock market reaches a certain level of activity,

etc. It should be noted that "previously scheduled" inspections

that vest discretion in the inspector are permissible when otherwise lawful.

So long as the examination, _e.g._, an entrance gate inspection,

has been previously scheduled, the fact that reasonable exercise of discretion

is involved in singling out individuals to be inspected is not improper;

such inspection must not be in violation of the Equal Protection clause of

the 5th Amendment or be used as a subterfuge intended to allow search of

certain specific individuals. 

 The Rule applies special restrictions

to contraband inspections because of the inherent possibility that such inspection

may be used as subterfuge searches. Although a lawful inspection may be conducted

with a secondary motive to prosecute those found in possession of contraband,

the primary motive must be administrative in nature. The Rule recognizes

the fact that commanders are ordinarily more concerned with removal of contraband

from units-thereby eliminating its negative effects on unit

readiness-than with prosecution of those found in possession of it. The fact that

possession of contraband is itself unlawful renders the probability that an

 inspection may be a subterfuge somewhat higher than that for an inspection

not intended to locate such material. 

 An inspection which has

as its intent, or one of its intents, in whole or in part, the discovery

of contraband, however slight, must comply with the specific requirements

set out in the Rule for inspections for contraband. An inspection which does

not have such an intent need not so comply and will yield admissible evidence

if contraband is found incidentally by the inspection. Contraband is defined

as material the possession of which is by its very nature unlawful. Material

may be declared to be unlawful by appropriate statute, regulation, or order.

For example, if liquor is prohibited aboard ship, a shipboard inspection

for liquor must comply with the rules for inspections for contraband. 

 Before

unlawful weapons or other contraband may be the subject of an inspection

under Rule 313(b), there must be a determination that "such property

would affect adversely the security, military fitness, or good order and

discipline of the command." In the event of an adequate defense challenge

under Rule 311 to an inspection for contraband, the prosecution must establish

by a preponderance that such property would in fact so adversely affect the

command. Although the question is an objective one, its resolution depends

heavily on factors unique to the personnel or location inspected. If such

contraband would adversely affect the ability of the command to complete

its assigned mission in any significant way, the burden is met. The nature

of the assigned mission is unimportant, for that is a matter within the

prerogative of the chain of command only. The expert testimony of those within

 the chain of command of a given unit is worthy of great weight as the only

 purpose for permitting such an inspection is to ensure military readiness.

The physiological or psychological effects of a given drug on an individual

are normally irrelevant except insofar as such evidence is relevant to the

question of the user's ability to perform duties without impaired efficiency.

As inspections are generally quantitative examinations, the nature and amount

of contraband sought is relevant to the question of the government's burden.

The existence of five unlawful drug users in an Army division, for example,

is unlikely to meet the Rule's test involving adverse effect, but five users

in an Army platoon may well do so. 

 The Rule does not require

that personnel to be inspected be given preliminary notice of the inspection

although such advance notice may well be desirable as a matter of policy

or in the interests, as perhaps in gate inspections, of establishing an alternative

basis, such as consent, for the examination. 

 Rule 313(b) requires

that inspections be conducted in a "reasonable fashion." The

timing of an inspection and its nature may be of importance. Inspections

conducted at a highly unusual time are not inherently

unreasonable-especially when a legitimate reason of such timing is present. However, a

0200 inspection, for example, may be unreasonable depending upon the surrounding

circumstances. 

 The Rule expressly permits the use of "any

reasonable or natural technological aid." Thus, dogs may be used to

detect contraband in an otherwise valid inspection for contraband. This conclusion

follows directly from the fact that inspections for contraband conducted

in compliance with Rule 313 are lawful. Consequently, the technique of inspection

is generally unimportant under the new rules. The Committee did, however,

as a matter of policy require that the natural or technological aid be "reasonable." 

 Rule

313(b) recognizes and affirms the commander's power to conduct administrative

examinations which are primarily non-prosecutorial in purpose. Personnel

directing inspections for contraband must take special care to ensure that

such inspections comply with Rule 313(b) and thus do not constitute improper

general searches or subterfuges. 

 _1984 Amendment:_ Much

of the foregoing Analysis was rendered obsolete by amendments made in 1984.

The third sentence of Rule 313(b) was modified and the fourth and sixth sentences

are new. 

 The fourth sentence is new. The Military Rule of Evidence

did not previously expressly address _production_ of body

fluids, perhaps because of _United States v. Ruiz_, 23 U.S.C.M.A.

181, 48 C.M.R. 797 (1974). _Ruiz_ was implicitly overruled

in _ United States v. Armstrong_, 9 M.J. 374 (C.M.A. 1980).

Uncertainty concerning the course of the law of inspections may also have

contributed to the drafter's silence on the matter. _See United States

v. Roberts_, 2 M.J. 31 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v. Thomas

_, 1 M.J. 397 (C.M.A. 1976). Much of the uncertainty in this area

 was dispelled in _United States v. Middleton_, 10 M.J. 123

 (C.M.A. 1981). _See also Murray v. Haldeman_, 16 M.J. 74 (C.M.A.

 1983). 

 Despite the absence in the rules of express authority

for compulsory production of body fluids, it apparently was the intent of

the drafters to permit such production as part of inspections, relying at

least in part on the medical purpose exception in Mil. R. Evid. 312(f). Mil.

R. Evid. 312(d) applies only to nonconsensual extraction (_e.g.,_

catheterization, drawing blood) of body fluids. This was noted in the Analysis,

 Mil. R. Evid. 312(d), which went on to state that "compulsory urinalysis,

 whether random or not, made for appropriate medical purposes, _ see

_ Rule 312(f), and the product of such a procedure if otherwise admissible

may be used at a court-martial." 

 There is considerable overlap

between production of body fluid for a medical purpose under Mil. R. Evid.

312(f) and for determining and ensuring military fitness in a unit, organization,

installation, vessel, aircraft, or vehicle. Frequently the two purposes are

coterminous. Ultimately, the overall health of members of the organization

is indivisible from the ability of the organization to perform the mission.

To the extent that a "medical purpose" embraces anything relating

to the physical or mental state of a person and that person's ability to

perform assigned duties, then the two purposes may be identical. Such a construction

of "medical purpose" would seem to swallow up the specific rules

and limitations in Mil. R. Evid. 312(f), however. Therefore, a distinction

may be drawn between a medical purpose-at least to the extent that

term is construed to concern primarily the health of the

individual-and the goal of ensuring the overall fitness of the organization. For example,

it may be appropriate to test-by compulsory production of

urine-persons whose duties entail highly dangerous or sensitive duties. The primary

purpose of such tests is to ensure that the mission will be performed safely

and properly. Preserving the health of the individual is an

incident-albeit a very important one-of that purpose. A person whose urine

is found to contain dangerous drugs is relieved from duty during gunnery

practice, for example, not so much to preserve that person's health as to

protect the safety of others. On the other hand, a soldier who is extremely

ill may be compelled to produce urine (or even have it extracted) not so

much so that soldier can return to duty-although the military has

an interest in this-as for that soldier's immediate health needs. 

 Therefore,

Mil. R. Evid. 313(b) provides an independent, although often closely related

basis for compulsory production of body fluids, with Mil. R. Evid. 312(f).

By expressly providing for both, possible confusion or an unnecessarily narrow

construction under Mil. R. Evid. 312(f) will be avoided. Note that all of

the requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 313(b) apply to an order to produce body

fluids under that rule. This includes the requirement that the inspection

be done in a reasonable fashion. This rule does not prohibit, as part of

an otherwise lawful inspection, compelling a person to drink a reasonable

amount of water in order to facilitate production of a urine sample. _

See United States v. Mitchell_, 16 M.J. 654 (N.M.C.M.R. 1983). 

 The

sixth sentence is based on _United States v. Middleton, supra. Middleton

_ was not decided on the basis of Mil. R. Evid. 313, as the inspection

in _Middleton_ occurred before the effective date of the Military

Rules of Evidence. The Court discussed Mil. R. Evid. 313(b), but "did

not now decide on the legality of this Rule (or) bless its application." _

United States v. Middleton, supra_ at 131. However, the reasoning

and the holding in _Middleton_ suggest that the former language

in Mil. R. Evid. 313(b) may have established unnecessary burdens for the

prosecution, yet still have been inadequate to protect against subterfuge

inspections, under some circumstances. 

 The former language allowed

an inspection for "unlawful weapons and other contraband when such

property would affect adversely the security, military fitness, or good order

and discipline of the command and when (1) there is a reasonable suspicion

that such property is present in the command or (2) the examination is a

previously scheduled examination of the command." This required a case-by-case

showing of the adverse effects of the weapons or contraband (including controlled

substances) in the particular unit, organization, installation, aircraft,

or vehicle examined._ See_ Analysis, Mil. R. Evid. 313(b).

In addition, the examination had to be based on a reasonable suspicion such

items were present, or be previously scheduled. 

 _Middleton

_ upheld an inspection which had as one of its purposes the discovery

of contraband-i.e., drugs. Significantly, there is no indication in _

Middleton_ that a specific showing of the adverse effects of such

contraband in the unit or organization is necessary. The court expressly

recognized (_see United States v. Middleton, supra_ at 129; _

cf. United States v. Trottier_ , 9 M.J. 337 (C.M.A. 1980)) the adverse

effect of drugs on the ability of the armed services to perform the mission

without requiring evidence on the point. Indeed, it may generally be assumed

that if it is illegal to possess an item under a statute or lawful regulation,

the adverse effect of such item on security, military fitness, or good order

and discipline is established by such illegality, without requiring the commander

to personally analyze its effects on a case-by-case basis and the submission

of evidence at trial. The defense may challenge the constitutionality of

the statute or the legality of the regulation (_cf. United States

v. Wilson_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 165, 30 C.M.R. 165 (1961); _United

States v. Nation_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 724, 26 C.M.R. 504 (1958)) but this

burden falls on the defense. Thus, this part of the former test is deleted

as unnecessary. Note, however, that it may be necessary to demonstrate a

valid military purpose to inspect for some noncontraband items. _

 See United States v. Brown_, 12 M.J. 420 (C.M.A. 1982). 

 _

Middleton_ upheld broad authority in the commander to inspect for

contraband, as well as other things, "when adequate safeguards are

present which assure that the 'inspection' was really intended

to determine and assure the readiness of the unit inspected, rather than

merely to provide a subterfuge for avoiding limitations that apply to a search

and seizure in a criminal investigation." As noted above, the Court

in_ Middleton_ expressly reserved judgment whether Mil. R.

 Evid. 313(b) as then written satisfied this test. 

 The two prongs

of the second part of the former test were intended to prevent subterfuge.

However, they did not necessarily do so. Indeed, the "reasonable suspicion"

test could be read to expressly authorize a subterfuge search. _See,

e.g., United States v. Lange_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 486, 35 C.M.R. 458 (1965).

The "previously scheduled" test is an excellent way to prove

that an inspection was not directed as the result of a reported offense,

and the new formulation so retains it. However, it alone does not ensure

absence of prosecutorial motive when specific individuals are singled out,

albeit well in advance, for special treatment. 

 At the same time,

the former test could invalidate a genuine inspection which had no prosecutorial

purpose. For example, a commander whose unit was suddenly alerted for a special

mission might find it necessary, even though the commander had no actual

suspicion contraband is present, to promptly inspect for contraband, just

to be certain none was present. A commander in such a position should not

be prohibited from inspecting. 

 The new language removes these

problems and is more compatible with _Middleton_. It does

not establish unnecessary hurdles for the prosecution. A commander may inspect

for contraband just as for any other deficiencies, problems, or conditions,

without having to show any particular justification for doing so. As the

fifth sentence in the rule indicates, any examination made primarily for

the purpose of prosecution is not a valid inspection under the rule. The

sixth sentence identifies those situations which, objectively, raise a strong

likelihood of subterfuge. These situations are based on _United States

v. Lange, supra_ and _United States v. Hay_, 3 M.J.

654, 655-56 (A.C.M.R. 1977) (_quoted in United States v. Middleton,

supra_ at 127-28 n.7; _see also United States v. Brown,

supra_). "Specific individuals" means persons named or

identified on the basis of individual characteristics, rather than by duty

assignment or membership in a subdivision of the unit, organization, installation,

vessel, aircraft, or vehicle, such as a platoon or squad, or on a random

basis. _See United States v. Harris_, 5 M.J. 44 (C.M.A. 1978).

The first sentence of subsection (b) makes clear that a part of one of the

listed categories may be inspected. _Cf. United States v. King_,

2 M.J. 4 (C.M.A. 1976). 

 The existence of one or more of the three

circumstances identified in the fifth sentence does not mean that the examination

is, _per se,_ not an inspection. The prosecution may still

prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the purpose of the examination

was to determine and ensure security, military fitness, and good order and

discipline, and not for the primary purpose of prosecution. For example,

when an examination is ordered immediately following a report of a specific

offense in the unit, the prosecution might prove the absence of subterfuge

by showing that the evidence of the particular offense had already been recovered

when the inspection was ordered and that general concern about the welfare

of the unit was the motivation for the inspection. Also, if a commander received

a report that a highly dangerous item (_e.g.,_ an explosive)

was present in the command, it might be proved that the commander's concern

about safety was the primary purpose for the examination, not prosecution.

In the case in which specific individuals are examined, or subjected to more

intrusive examinations than others, these indicia of subterfuge might be

overcome by proof that these persons were not chosen with a view of prosecution,

but on neutral ground or for an independent purpose-_e.g.,

_ individuals were selected because they were new to the unit and

had not been thoroughly examined previously. These examples are not exclusive. 

 The

absence of any of the three circumstances in the fifth sentence, while indicative

of a proper inspection, does not necessarily preclude a finding of subterfuge.

However, the prosecution need not meet the higher burden of persuasion when

the issue is whether the commander's purpose was prosecutorial, in the absence

of these circumstances. 

 The new language provides objective criteria

by which to measure a subjective standard, _i.e.,_ the commander's

purpose. Because the standard is ultimately subjective, however, the objective

criteria are not conclusive. Rather they provide concrete and realistic guidance

for commanders to use in the exercise of their inspection power, and for

judicial authorities to apply in reviewing the exercise of that power. 

### (c) Inventories.

Rule 313(c) codifies prior law by recognizing the admissibility

of evidence seized via bona fide inventory. The rationale behind this exception

to the usual probable cause requirement is that such an inventory is not

 prosecutorial in nature and is a reasonable intrusion. _See, e.g.,

South Dakota v. Opperman_, 428 U.S. 364 (1976). 

 An inventory

may not be used as subterfuge search, _United States v. Mossbauer

_, 20 C.M.A. 584, 44 C.M.R. 14 (1971), and the basis for an inventory

and the procedure utilized may be subject to challenge in any specific case. Inventories

of the property of detained individuals have usually been sustained. _

See, e.g., United States v. Brashears_, 21 C.M.A. 552, 45 C.M.R.

326 (1972). 

 The committee does not, however, express an opinion

as to the lawful scope of an inventory. _See, e.g., South Dakota v.

 Opperman_, 428 U.S. 364 (1976), in which the court did not determine

 the propriety of opening the locked trunk or glove box during the inventory

of a properly impounded automobile. 

 Inventories will often be

governed by regulation.

 _2013 Amendment._ The definition of "inventory" was added to subsection (c) to further distinguish inventories from inspections. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 314. Searches not requiring probable cause

 The list of non-probable cause searches contained within Rule

 314 is intended to encompass most of the non-probable cause searches common

in the military environment. The term "search" is used in Rule

314 in its broadest non-technical sense. Consequently, a "search"

for purposes of Rule 314 may include examinations that are not "searches"

within the narrow technical sense of the Fourth Amendment. _See, e.g.

_, Rule 314(j). 

 Insofar as Rule 314 expressly deals with

a given type of search, the Rule preempts the area in that the Rule must

be followed even should the Supreme Court issue a decision more favorable

to the Government. If such a decision involves a non-probable cause search

of a _type_ not addressed in Rule 314, it will be fully applicable

to the Armed Forces under Rule 314(k) unless other authority prohibits such

application. 

### (a) General Rule.

Rule 314(a) provides that evidence obtained from a search conducted

 pursuant to Rule 314 and not in violation of another Rule, _e.g._,

Rule 312, Bodily Views and Intrusions, is admissible when relevant and not

 otherwise inadmissible. 

### (b) Border Searches.

Rule 314(b) recognizes that military personnel may perform border

 searches when authorized to do so by Congress. 

### (c) Searches upon entry to United States installations, aircraft, and

vessels abroad.

Rule 314(c) follows the opinion of Chief Judge Fletcher in _

 United States v. Rivera_, 4 M.J. 215, 216 n.2 (C.M.A. 1978), in which he

applied the border search doctrine to entry searches

of United States installations or enclaves on foreign soil. The search must

be reasonable and its intent, in line with all border searches, must be primarily

 prophylactic. This authority is additional to any other powers to search

or inspect that a commander may hold. 

 Although Rule 314(c) is

similar to Rule 313(b), it is distinct in terms of its legal basis. Consequently,

a search performed pursuant to Rule 314(c) need not comply with the burden

of proof requirement found in Rule 313(b) for contraband inspections even

though the purpose of the 314(c) examination is to prevent introduction of

contraband into the installation, aircraft or vessel. 

 A Rule

314(c) examination must, however, be for a purpose denominated in the rule

and must be rationally related to such purpose. A search pursuant to Rule

314(c) is possible only upon entry to the installation, aircraft, or vessel,

and an individual who chooses not to enter removes any basis for search pursuant

to Rule 314(c). The Rule does not indicate whether discretion may be vested

in the person conducting a properly authorized Rule 314(c) search. It was

the opinion of members of the Committee, however, that such discretion is

proper considering the Rule's underlying basis. 

 _1984 Amendment:

_ Subsection (c) was amended by adding "or exit from"

based on _United States v. Alleyne_, 13 M.J. 331 (C.M.A. 1982).

### (d) Searches of government property.

Rule 314(d) restates prior law, _see, e.g., United States

v. Weshenfelder_, 20 C.M.A. 416, 43 C.M.R. 256 (1971), and recognizes

that personnel normally do not have sufficient interest in government property

to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in it. Although the rule could

be equally well denominated as a lack of adequate interest, _see,

_ Rule 311(a)(2), it is more usually expressed as a non-probable

cause search. The Rule recognizes that certain government property may take

on aspects of private property allowing an individual to develop a reasonable

expectation of privacy surrounding it. Wall or floor lockers in living quarters

issued for the purpose of storing personal property will normally, although

not necessarily, involve a reasonable expectation of privacy. It was the

intent of the Committee that such lockers give rise to a rebuttable presumption

that they do have an expectation of privacy, and that insofar as other government

property is concerned such property gives rise to a rebuttable presumption

that such an expectation is absent. 

 Public property, such as

streets, parade grounds, parks, and office buildings rarely if ever involves

any limitations upon the ability to search. 

### (e) Consent Searches.

#### (1) General rule.

The rule in force before 1980 was found in Para. 152, MCM, 1969

 (Rev.), the relevant sections of which state: 

 A search of one's

person with his freely given consent, or of property with the freely given

consent of a person entitled in the situation involved to waive the right

to immunity from an unreasonable search, such as an owner, bailee, tenant,

or occupant as the case may be under the circumstances [is lawful]. 

 If

the justification for using evidence obtained as a result of a search is

that there was a freely given consent to the search, that consent must be

shown by clear and positive evidence. 

 Although Rule 314(e) generally

restates prior law without substantive change, the language has been recast.

The basic rule for consent searches is taken from _Schneckloth v.

Bustamonte_, 412 U.S. 218 (1973). 

#### (2) Who may consent.

The Manual language illustrating when third parties may consent

to searches has been omitted as being insufficient and potentially misleading

and has been replaced by Rule 314(e)(2). The Rule emphasizes the degree of

control that an individual has over property and is intended to deal with

circumstances in which third parties may be asked to grant consent. _

See, e.g., Frazier v. Cupp_, 394 U.S. 731 (1969); _Stoner

v. California_, 376 U.S. 483 (1964); _United States v. Mathis

_, 16 C.M.A. 511, 37 C.M.R. 142 (1967). It was the Committee's intent

to restate prior law in this provision and not to modify it in any degree.

Consequently, whether an individual may grant consent to a search of property

not his own is a matter to be determined on a case by case basis. 

#### (3) Scope of consent.

Rule 314(e)(3) restates prior law._ See, e.g., United States

 v. Castro_, 23 C.M.A. 166, 48 C.M.R. 782 (1974); _United States

 v. Cady_, 22 C.M.A. 408, 47 C.M.R. 345 (1973). 

#### (4) Voluntariness.

Rule 314(e)(3) requires that consent be voluntary to be valid. The

 second sentence is taken in substance from _Schneckloth v. Bustamonte

_, 412 U.S. 218, 248-49 (1973). 

 The specific inapplicability

of Article 31(b) warnings follows _Schneckloth_ and complies

with _United States v. Morris_, 1 M.J. 352 (C.M.A. 1976) (opinion

by Chief Judge Fletcher with Judge Cook concurring in the result). Although

not required, such warnings are, however, a valuable indication of a voluntary

consent. The Committee does not express an opinion as to whether rights warnings

are required prior to obtaining an admissible statement as to ownership or

possession of property from a suspect when that admission is obtained via

a request for consent to search. 

#### (5) Burden of proof.

Although not constitutionally required, the burden of proof in

Para. 152 of the 1969 Manual for consent searches has been retained in a slightly

different form-"clear and convincing" in place of "clear

and positive"-on the presumption that the basic nature of the

military structure renders consent more suspect than in the civilian community.

"Clear and convincing evidence" is intended to create a burden

of proof between the preponderance and beyond a reasonable doubt standards.

The Rule expressly rejects a different burden for custodial consents. The

law is this area evidences substantial confusion stemming initially from

language used in _United States v. Justice_, 13 C.M.A. 31,

34, 32 C.M.R. 31, 34 (1962): "It [the burden of proof]

is an especially heavy obligation if the accused was in custody. . .,"

which was taken in turn from a number of civilian federal court decisions.

While custody should be a factor resulting in an especially careful scrutiny

of the circumstances surrounding a possible consent, there appears to be

no legal or policy reason to require a higher burden of proof. 

### (f) Frisks incident to a lawful stop.

Rule 314(f) recognizes a frisk as a lawful search when performed

 pursuant to a lawful stop. The primary authority for the stop and frisk

doctrine is _Terry v. Ohio_, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), and the present

 Manual lacks any reference to either stops or frisks. Hearsay may be used

in deciding to stop and frisk. _See, e.g., Adams v. Williams_,

407 U.S. 143 (1972). 

 The Rule recognizes the necessity for assisting

police or law enforcement personnel in their investigations but specifically

does not address the issue of the lawful duration of a stop nor of the nature

of the questioning, if any, that may be involuntarily addressed to the individual

 stopped. _See Brown v. Texas_, 440 U.S. 903 (1979), generally

 prohibiting such questioning in civilian life. Generally, it would appear

that any individual who can be lawfully stopped is likely to be a suspect

for the purposes of Article 31(b). Whether identification can be demanded

of a military suspect without Article 31(b) warnings is an open question

and may be dependent upon whether the identification of the suspect is relevant

to the offense possibly involved. _See_ Frederic Lederer, _

Rights Warnings in the Armed Services_, 72 Mil. L. Rev. 1, 40-41

(1976). 

 _1984 Amendment:_ Subsection (f)(3) was

added based on _Michigan v. Long_, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983).

### (g) Searches incident to a lawful apprehension.

The 1969 Manual rule was found in Para. 152 and stated: 

 A

search conducted as an incident of lawfully apprehending a person, which

may include a search of his person, of the clothing he is wearing, and of

property which, at time of apprehension, is in his immediate possession or

control, or of an area from within which he might gain possession of weapons

or destructible evidence; and a search of the place where the apprehension

is made [is lawful]. 

 Rule 314(g) restates the

principle found within the Manual text but utilizes new and clarifying language.

The Rule expressly requires that an apprehension be lawful. 

#### (1) General Rule.

Rule 314(g)(1) expressly authorizes the search of a person of a

 lawfully apprehended individual without further justification. 

#### (2) Search for weapons and destructible evidence.

Rule 314(g)(2) delimits the area that can be searched pursuant to

an apprehension and specifies that the purpose of the search is only to locate

 weapons and destructible evidence. This is a variation of the authority

presently in the Manual and is based upon the Supreme Court's decision in

 _Chimel v. California_, 395 U.S. 752 (1969). It is clear from

 the Court's decision in_ United States v. Chadwick_, 438 U.S.

1 (1977), that the scope of a search pursuant to a lawful apprehension must

be limited to those areas which an individual could reasonably reach and

utilize. The search of the area within the immediate control of the person

apprehended is thus properly viewed as a search based upon

necessity-whether one based upon the safety of those persons apprehending or upon the

necessity to safeguard evidence. _Chadwick_, holding that

police could not search a sealed footlocker pursuant to an arrest, stands

for the proposition that the_ Chimel_ search must be limited

by its rationale. 

 That portion of the 1969 Manual dealing with intrusive body searches has been incorporated into Rule 312.

Similarly that portion of the Manual dealing with search incident to hot

pursuit of a person has been incorporated into that portion of Rule 315 dealing

with exceptions to the need for search warrants or authorizations. 

 _

1984 Amendment:_ Subsection (g)(2) was amended by adding language

to clarify the permissible scope of a search incident to apprehension of

the occupant of an automobile based on _New York v. Belton_,

453 U.S. 454 (1981). The holding of the Court used the term "automobile"

so that word is used in the rule. It is intended that the term "automobile"

have the broadest possible meaning. 

#### (3) Examination for other persons.

Rule 314(g)(3) is intended to protect personnel performing apprehensions.

Consequently, it is extremely limited in scope and requires a good faith

and reasonable belief that persons may be present who might interfere with

the apprehension of individuals. Any search must be directed towards the

finding of such persons and not evidence. 

 An unlawful apprehension

of the accused may make any subsequent statement by the accused inadmissible.

_Dunaway v. New York_, 442 U.S. 200 (1979). 

 _1994

Amendment._ The amendment to Mil. R. Evid. 314(g)(3), based on _

Maryland v. Buie_, 494 U.S. 325 (1990), specifies the circumstances

permitting the search for other persons and distinguishes between protective

sweeps and searches of the attack area. 

 Subsection (A) permits

protective sweeps in the military. The last sentence of this subsection

clarifies that an examination under the rule need not be based on probable

cause. Rather, this subsection adopts the standard articulated in _

Terry v. Ohio_, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) and_ Michigan v. Long_,

463 U.S. 1032 (1983). As such, there must be articulable facts that, taken

together with the rational inferences from those facts, would warrant a reasonably

prudent officer in believing the area harbors individuals posing a danger

to those at the site of apprehension. The previous language referring to

those "who might interfere" was deleted to conform to the standards

set forth in _Buie_. An examination under this rule is limited

to a cursory visual inspection of those places in which a person might be

hiding. 

 A new subsection (B) was also added as a result of _

Buie, supra_. The amendment clarifies that apprehending officials

may examine the "attack area" for persons who might pose a danger

to apprehending officials. _See Buie_, 494 U.S. at 334. The

attack area is that area immediately adjoining the place of apprehension

from which an attack could be immediately launched. This amendment makes

it clear that apprehending officials do not need any suspicion to examine

the attack area. 

### (h) Searches within jails, confinement facilities, or similar facilities.

Personnel confined in a military confinement facility or housed

in a facility serving a generally similar purpose will normally yield any

normal Fourth Amendment protections to the reasonable needs of the facility. _

 See United States v. Maglito_, 20 C.M.A. 456, 43 C.M.R. 296 (1971).

 _See also_ Rule 312. 

### (i) Emergency searches to save life or for related purpose.

This type of search is not found within the 1969 Manual provision

but is in accord with prevailing civilian and military case law. _

See United States v. Yarborough_, 50 C.M.R. 149, 155 (A.F.C.M.R.

1975). Such a search must be conducted in good faith and may not be a subterfuge

in order to circumvent an individual's Fourth Amendment protections. 

### (j) Searches of open fields or woodlands.

This type of search is taken from 1969 Manual paragraph 152. Originally

recognized in _Hester v. United States_, 265 U.S. 57 (1924),

this doctrine was revived by the Supreme Court in_ Air Pollution Variance

Board v. Western Alfalfa Corp._, 416 U.S. 861 (1974). Arguably, such

a search is not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In _

Hester_, Mr. Justice Holmes simply concluded that "the special

protection accorded by the 4th Amendment to the people in their [persons,

houses, papers, and effects] is not extended to the open fields."

265 U.S. at 59. In relying on _Hester_, the Court in _

Air Pollution Variance Board_ noted that it was "not advised

that he [the air pollution investigator] was on premises

from which the public was excluded." 416 U.S. at 865. This suggests

that the doctrine of open fields is subject to the caveat that a reasonable

expectation of privacy may result in application of the Fourth Amendment

to open fields. 

### (k) Other searches.

Rule 314(k) recognizes that searches of a_ type_ not

 specified within the Rule but proper under the Constitution are also lawful.

 _2013 Amendment._ Language was added to subsection (a) to elucidate that the rules as written afford at least the minimal amount of protection required under the Constitution as applied to service members. If new case law is developed after the publication of these rules which raises the minimal constitutional standards for the admissibility of evidence, that standard will apply to evidence admissibility, rather than the standard established under these rules.

 In subsection (c), the committee intentionally recommended limiting the ability of a commander to search persons or property upon entry to or exit from the installation alone, rather than anywhere on the installation, despite the indication of some courts in dicta that security personnel can search a personally owned vehicle anywhere on a military installation based on no suspicion at all. _See, e.g., United States v. Rogers_, 549 F.2d 490, 493-94 (8th Cir. 1976). Allowing suspicionless searches anywhere on a military installation too drastically narrows an individual's privacy interest. Although individuals certainly have a diminished expectation of privacy when they are on a military installation, they do not forgo their privacy interest completely.

 The committee added a Discussion section below subsection (c) to address searches conducted contrary to a treaty or agreement. That material was previously located in subsection (c) and was moved to the Discussion because it addresses conduct rather than the admissibility of evidence. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis.

 Although not explicitly stated in subsection (e)(2), the committee intends   that the Supreme Court's holding in _Georgia v. Randolph_, 547 U.S. 103 (2006), apply to this subsection. _See id._ at 114-15 (holding that a warrantless search was unreasonable if a physically present co-tenant expressly refused to give consent to search, even if another co-tenant had given consent).

 In subsection (f)(2), the phrase "reasonably believed" was changed to "reasonably suspected" to align with recent case law and to alleviate any confusion that "reasonably believed" established a higher level of suspicion required to conduct a stop-and-frisk than required by the Supreme Court in _Terry v. Ohio_, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). The "reasonably suspected" standard conforms to the language of the Supreme Court in _Arizona v. Johnson_, 555 U.S. 323, 326 (2009), in which the Court stated: "To justify a patdown of the driver or a passenger during a traffic stop, however, just as in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of criminal activity, the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous." The committee intends that this standard, and not a higher one, be required before an individual can be stopped and frisked under this subsection. Additionally, the committee recommended adding a discussion paragraph following this subsection to further expound on the nature and scope of the search, based on case law. _See, e.g., Terry_, 392 U.S. at 30-31; _Pennsylvania v. Mimms_, 434 U.S. 106, 111-112 (1977).

 In subsection (f)(3), the committee recommended changing the phrase "reasonable belief" to "reasonable suspicion" for the same reasons discussed above. The committee added the discussion section to provide more guidance on the nature and scope of the search, based on case law. _See, e.g., Michigan v. Long_, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049 (1983) ("the search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on 'specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant' the officers in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons"); _Mimms_, 434 U.S. at 111 (no Fourth Amendment violation when the driver was ordered out of the car after a valid traffic stop but without any suspicion that he was armed and dangerous because "what is at most a mere inconvenience cannot prevail when balanced against legitimate concerns for the officer's safety"); _Maryland v. Wilson_, 519 U.S. 408 (1997) (extending the holding in _Mimms_ to passengers as well as drivers).

 The committee recommended moving the language from former subsection (g)(2), describing the search of an automobile incident to a lawful arrest of an occupant, to the discussion paragraph immediately following subsection (f)(3)  because  it addresses conduct rather than the admissibility of evidence. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. The discussion section is based on the Supreme Court's holding in _Arizona v. Gant_, 556 U.S. 332, 351 (2009) ("Police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest").

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 315. Probable cause searches

### (a) General Rule-

Rule 315 states that evidence obtained pursuant to the Rule is

admissible when relevant and not otherwise admissible under the Rules. 

### (b) Definitions.

#### (1) Authorization to search.

Rule 315(b)(1) defines an "authorization to search"

as an express permission to search issued by proper military authority whether

 commander or judge. As such, it replaces the term "search warrant"

 which is used in the Rules only when referring to a permission to search

given by proper civilian authority. The change in terminology reflects the

unique nature of the armed forces and of the role played by commanders.

#### (2) Search warrant.

The expression "search warrant" refers only to the

authority to search issued by proper civilian authority. 

### (c) Scope of authorization.

Rule 315(c) is taken generally from Para. 152(1)-(3) of the

 1969 Manual except that military jurisdiction to search upon military installations

or in military aircraft, vessels, or vehicles has been clarified. Although

civilians and civilian institutions on military installations are subject

to search pursuant to a proper search authorization, the effect of any applicable

federal statute or regulation must be considered. _ E.g._,

The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, 12 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3401-3422,

and DOD Directive 5400.12 (Obtaining Information From Financial Institutions). 

 Rule

315(c)(4) is a modification of prior law. Subdivision (c)(4)(A) is intended

to ensure cooperation between Department of Defense agencies and other government

agencies by requiring prior consent to DOD searches involving such other

agencies. Although Rule 315(c)(4)(B) follows the 1969 Manual in permitting

searches of "other property in a foreign country" to be authorized

pursuant to subdivision (d), subdivision (c) requires that all applicable

treaties be complied with or that prior concurrence with an appropriate representative

of the foreign nation be obtained if no treaty or agreement exists. The Rule

is intended to foster cooperation with host nations and compliance with all

existing international agreements. The rule does not require specific approval

by foreign authority of each search (unless, of course, applicable treaty

requires such approval); rather the Rule permits prior blanket or categorical

approvals. Because Rule 315(c)(4) is designed to govern intragovernmental

and international relationships rather than relationships between the United

States and its citizens, a violation of these provisions does not render

a search unlawful. 

### (d) Power to authorize.

Rule 315(d) grants power to authorize searches to impartial

 individuals of the included classifications. The closing portion of the

subdivision clarifies the decision of the Court of Military Appeals in _

 United States v. Ezell_, 6 M.J. 307 (C.M.A. 1979), by stating that

the mere presence of an authorizing officer at a search does not deprive

the individual of an otherwise neutral character. This is in conformity with

the decision of the United States Supreme Court in _Lo-Ji Sales v.

New York_, 442 U.S. 319 (1979), from which the first portion of the

 language has been taken. The subdivision also recognizes the propriety of

a commander granting a search authorization after taking a pretrial action

 equivalent to that which may be taken by a federal district judge. For example,

 a commander might authorize use of a drug detector dog, an action arguably

 similar to the granting of wiretap order by a federal judge, without necessarily

depriving himself or herself of the ability to later issue a search authorization.

The question would be whether the commander has acted in the first instance

in an impartial judicial capacity. 

#### (1) Commander.

Rule 315(d)(1) restates the prior rule by recognizing the power

of commanders to issue search authorizations upon probable cause. The Rule

 explicitly allows non-officers serving in a position designated by the Secretary

concerned as a position of command to issue search authorizations. If a non-officer

assumes command of a unit, vessel, or aircraft, and the command position

is one recognized by regulations issued by the Secretary concerned, _

e.g._, command of a company, squadron, vessel, or aircraft, the non-officer

commander is empowered to grant search authorizations under this subdivision

whether the assumption of command is pursuant to express appointment or devolution

of command. The power to do so is thus a function of position rather than

rank. 

 The Rule also allows a person serving as officer-in-charge

or in a position designated by the Secretary as a position analogous to an

 officer-in-charge to grant search authorizations. The term "officer-in-charge"

is statutorily defined, Article 1(4), as pertaining only to the Navy, Coast

Guard, and Marine Corps, and the change will allow the Army and Air Force

to establish an analogous position should they desire to do so in which case

the power to authorize searches would exist although such individuals would

not be "officers-in-charge" as that term is used in the U.C.M.J.

#### (2) Delegee.

Former subsection (2), which purported to allow delegation of the

 authority to authorize searches, was deleted in 1984, based on _United

 States v. Kalscheuer_, 11 M.J. 373 (C.M.A. 1981). Subsection (3)

was renumbered as subsection (2). 

#### (3) Military judge.

Rule 315(d)(2) permits military judges to issue search authorizations

 when authorized to do so by the Secretary concerned. MILITARY MAGISTRATES

MAY ALSO BE EMPOWERED TO GRANT SEARCH AUTHORIZATIONS. This recognizes the

practice now in use in the Army but makes such practice discretionary with

the specific Service involved. 

### (e) Power to search.

Rule 315(e) specifically denominates those persons who may conduct

or authorize a search upon probable cause either pursuant to a search authorization

or when such an authorization is not required for reasons of exigencies.

The Rule recognizes, for example, that all officers and non-commissioned

officers have inherent power to perform a probable cause search without obtaining

of a search authorization under the circumstances set forth in Rule 315(g).

The expression "criminal investigator" within Rule 315(e) includes

members of the Army Criminal Investigation Command, the Marine Corps Criminal

Investigation Division, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the Air

Force Office of Special Investigations, and Coast Guard Investigative Service.

### (f) Basis for search authorizations.

Rule 315(f) requires that probable cause be present before a search

 can be conducted under the Rule and utilizes the basic definition of probable

 cause found in 1969 Manual Para. 152. 

 For reasons of clarity

the Rule sets forth a simple and general test to be used in all probable

cause determinations: probable cause can exist only if the authorizing individual

has a "reasonable belief that the information giving rise to the intent

to search is believable and has a factual basis." This test is taken

from the "two prong test" of _Aguilar v. Texas_,

378 U.S. 108 (1964), which was incorporated in Para. 152 of the 1969 Manual.

The Rule expands the test beyond the hearsay and informant area. The "factual

basis" requirement is satisfied when an individual reasonably concludes

that the information, if reliable, adequately apprises the individual that

the property in question is what it is alleged to be and is where it is alleged

to be. Information is "believable" when an individual reasonably

concludes that it is sufficiently reliable to be believed. 

 The

twin test of "believability" and "basis in fact"

must be met in all probable cause situations. The method of application of

the test will differ, however, depending upon circumstances. The following

examples are illustrative: 

(1) An individual making a probable cause determination who observes

an incident first hand is only required to determine if the observation is

 reliable and that the property is likely to be what it appears to be. 

 For

example, an officer who believes that she sees an individual in possession

of heroin must first conclude that the observation was reliable

(_i.e._, if her eyesight was adequate-should glasses have been

worn-and if there was sufficient time for adequate observation) and

 that she has sufficient knowledge and experience to be able to reasonably

 believe that the substance in question was in fact heroin. 

(2) An individual making a probable cause determination who relies upon

 the in person report of an informant must determine both that the informant

is believable and that the property observed is likely to be what the observer

 believes it to be. The determining individual may rely upon the demeanor

of the informant in order to determine whether the observer is believable.

An individual known to have a "clean record" and no bias against

the individual to be affected by the search is likely to be credible. 

(3) An individual making a probable cause determination who relies upon

 the report of an informant not present before the authorizing individual

must determine both that the informant is credible and that the property

observed is likely to be what the informant believed it to be. The determining

individual may utilize one or more of the following factors, among others,

in order to determine whether the informant is believable: 

##### (A) Prior record as a reliable informant.

Has the informant given information in the past which proved to

be accurate? 

##### (B) Corroborating detail.

Has enough detail of the informant's information been verified to

 imply that the remainder can reasonably be presumed to be accurate? 

##### (C) Statement against interest.

Is the information given by the informant sufficiently adverse to

the fiscal or penal interest of the informant to imply that the information

may reasonably be presumed to be accurate? 

##### (D) Good citizen.

Is the character of the informant, as known by the individual making

 the probable cause determination, such as to make it reasonable to presume

that the information is accurate? 

 Mere allegations may not be

relied upon. For example, an individual may not reasonably conclude that

an informant is reliable simply because the informant is so named by a law

enforcement agent. The individual making the probable cause determination

must be supplied with specific details of the informant's past actions to

allow that individual to personally and reasonably conclude that the informant

is reliable. 

 Information transmitted through law enforcement or

command channels is presumed to have been reliably transmitted. This presumption

may be rebutted by an affirmative showing that the information was transmitted

with intentional error. 

 The Rule permits a search authorization

to be issued based upon information transmitted by telephone or other means

of communication. 

 The Rule also permits the Secretaries concerned

to impose additional procedural requirements for the issuance of search authorizations. 

 _

1984 Amendment:_ The second sentence of subsection (f)(1) was deleted

based on _Illinois v. Gates_, 462 U.S.213 (1983), which overturned

the mandatory two-prong test of _Aguilar v. Texas, supra._ Although

the second sentence may be technically compatible with _Gates_,

it could be construed as requiring strict application of the standards of _

Aguilar_. The former language remains good advice for those deciding

the existence of probable cause, especially for uncorroborated tips, but

is not an exclusive test. _See also Massachusetts v. Upton_,

466 U.S. 767 (1984). 

### (g) Exigencies.

Rule 315(g) restates prior law and delimits those circumstances

in which a search warrant or authorization is unnecessary despite the ordinary

 requirement for one. In all such cases probable cause is required. 

 Rule

315(g)(1) deals with the case in which the time necessary to obtain a proper

authorization would threaten the destruction or concealment of the property

or evidence sought. 

 Rule 315(g)(2) recognizes that military necessity

may make it tactically impossible to attempt to communicate with a person

who could grant a search authorization. Should a nuclear submarine on radio

silence, for example, lack a proper authorizing individual (perhaps for

reasons of disqualification), no search could be conducted if the Rule were

otherwise unless the ship broke radio silence and imperiled the vessel or

its mission. Under the Rule this would constitute an "exigency."

"Military operational necessity" includes similar necessity incident

to the Coast Guard's performance of its maritime police mission. 

 The

Rule also recognizes in subdivision (g)(3) the "automobile exception"

created by the Supreme Court. _See, e.g., United States v. Chadwick

_, 433 U.S. 1 (1977); _South Dakota v. Opperman_,

428 U.S. 364 (1976); _Texas v. White_, 423 U.S. 67 (1975),

and, subject to the constraints of the Constitution, the Manual, or the Rules,

applies it to all vehicles. While the exception will thus apply to vessels

and aircraft as well as to automobiles, trucks, _et al,_ it

must be applied with great care. In view of the Supreme Court's reasoning

that vehicles are both mobile and involve a diminished expectation of privacy,

the larger a vehicle is, the more unlikely it is that the exception will

apply. The exception has no application to government vehicles as they may

be searched without formal warrant or authorization under Rule 314(d). 

 _

1984 Amendment:_ The last sentence of subsection (g) was amended

by deleting "presumed to be." The former language could be construed

to permit the accused to prove that the vehicle was in fact inoperable (that

is, to rebut the presumption of operability) thereby negating the exception,

even though a reasonable person would have believed the vehicle inoperable.

The fact of inoperability is irrelevant; the test is whether the official(s)

searching knew or should have known that the vehicle was inoperable. 

### (h) Execution.

Rule 314(h)(1) provides for service of a search warrant or search

 authorization upon a person whose property is to be searched when possible.

 Noncompliance with the Rule does not, however, result in exclusion of the

 evidence. Similarly, Rule 314(h)(2) provides for the inventory of seized

 property and provisions of a copy of the inventory to the person from whom

the property was seized. Noncompliance with the subdivision does not, however,

make the search or seizure unlawful. Under Rule 315(h)(3) compliance with

foreign law is required when executing a search authorization outside the

United States, but noncompliance does not trigger the exclusionary rule.

 _2013 Amendment._ Former subsection (h) was moved so that it immediately follows subsection (a). It was changed to a discussion paragraph because it generally applies to the entire rule, rather than any particular subsection and also because it addresses conduct rather than the admissibility of evidence.  _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis.

 In subsection (b), the committee recommended changing the term "authorization to search" to "search authorization" to align it with the term more commonly used by practitioners and law enforcement. The committee recommended moving former subsection (c)(4) to a discussion paragraph immediately following subsection (c) because it addresses conduct rather than the admissibility of evidence. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis.

 The committee recommended moving the second sentence in former subsection (d)(2) to subsection (d) to elucidate that its content applies to both commanders under subsection (d)(1) and military judges or magistrates under subsection (d)(2). The committee did so in reliance on CAAF's decision in _United States v. Huntzinger_, 69 M.J. 1 (C.A.A.F. 2010), which held that a commander is not per se disqualified from authorizing a search under this rule even if he has participated in investigative activities in furtherance of his command responsibilities.

 The committee recommended moving former subsection (h)(4), addressing the execution of search warrants, to subsection (e), now entitled "Who May Search," so that it was co-located with the subsection discussing the execution of search authorizations.

 In subsection (f)(2), the word "shall" was changed to "will" in conformance with the approach of the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules to minimize the use of words such as "shall" and "should" because of the potential disparity in application and interpretation of whether the word is precatory or prescriptive. In recommending that amendment, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 Subsection (g) was revised to include a definition of exigency rather than to provide examples that may not encompass the wide range of situations where exigency might apply. The definition is derived from Supreme Court jurisprudence. See Kentucky v. King, 131 S. Ct. 1849 (2011). The committee recommended retaining the language concerning military operational necessity as an exigent circumstance because this rule may be applied to a unique military context where it might be difficult to communicate with a person authorized to issue a search authorization. _See, e.g., United States v. Rivera_, 10 M.J. 55 (C.M.A. 1980) (noting that exigency might exist because of difficulties in communicating with an authorizing official, although the facts of that case did not support such a conclusion). The committee intends that nothing in this rule would prohibit a law enforcement officer from entering a private residence without a warrant to protect the individuals inside from harm, as that is not a search under the Fourth Amendment. _See, e.g., Brigham City v. Stuart_, 547 U.S. 398 (2006) (holding that, regardless of their subjective motives, police officers were justified in entering a home without a warrant, under exigent circumstances exception to warrant requirement, as they had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant was seriously injured or imminently threatened with injury).

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 316. Seizures

### (a) General Rule.

Rule 316(a) provides that evidence obtained pursuant to the Rule

is admissible when relevant and not otherwise inadmissible under the Rules.

Rule 316 recognizes that searches are distinct from seizures. Although rare,

a seizure need not be proceeded by a search. Property may, for example, be

seized after being located pursuant to plain view, _see_ subdivision

 (d)(4)(C). Consequently, the propriety of a seizure must be considered independently

of any preceding search. 

### (b) Seizures of property.

Rule 316(b) defines probable cause in the same fashion as defined

by Rule 315 for probable cause searches. _See_ the Analysis

of Rule 315(f)(2). The justifications for seizing property are taken from

1969 Manual Para. 152. Their number has, however, been reduced for reasons

of brevity. No distinction is made between "evidence of crime"

and "instrumentalities or fruits of crime." Similarly, the proceeds

of crime are also "evidence of crime." 

 _1984

Amendment:_ The second sentence of subsection (b) was deleted based

on _Illinois v. Gates_, 462 U.S. 213 (1983). _See_ Analysis,

Mil. R. Evid. 315(f)(1), _ supra._ 

### (c) Apprehension.

Apprehensions are, of course, seizures of the person and unlawful

 apprehensions may be challenged as an unlawful seizure. _See, e.g.,

 Dunaway v. New York_, 442 U.S. 200 (1979); _United States

v. Texidor-Perez_, 7 M.J. 356 (C.M.A. 1979). 

### (d) Seizure of property or evidence.

#### (1) Abandoned property.

Rule 316(d) restates prior law, not addressed specifically by the

 1969 Manual chapter, by providing that abandoned property may be seized by

 anyone at any time. 

#### (2) Consent.

Rule 316(d)(2) permits seizure of property with appropriate consent

 pursuant to Rule 314(e). The prosecution must demonstrate a voluntary consent

 by clear and convincing evidence. 

#### (3) Government property.

Rule 316(d)(3) permits seizure of government property without probable

cause unless the person to whom the property is issued or assigned has a

reasonable expectation of privacy therein at the time of seizure. In this

 regard, note Rule 314(d) and its analysis. 

#### (4) Other property.

Rule 316(d)(4) provides for seizure of property or evidence not

 otherwise addressed by the Rule. There must be justification to exercise

 control over the property. Although property may have been lawfully located,

it may not be seized for use at trial unless there is a reasonable belief

that the property is of a type discussed in Rule 316(b). Because the Rule

is inapplicable to seizures unconnected with law enforcement, it does not

limit the seizure of property for a valid administrative purpose such as

safety. 

 Property or evidence may be seized upon probable cause

when seizure is authorized or directed by a search warrant or authorization,

Rule 316(d)(4)(A); when exigent circumstances pursuant to Rule 315(g) permit

 proceeding without such a warrant or authorization; or when the property

or evidence is in plain view or smell, Rule 316(d)(4)(C). 

 Although

most plain view seizures are inadvertent, there is no necessity that a plain

view discovery be inadvertent-notwithstanding dicta, in some court

cases; _see Coolidge v. New Hampshire_, 403 U.S. 443 (1971).

The Rule allows a seizure pursuant to probable cause when made as a result

of plain view. The language used in Rule 316(d)(4)(C) is taken from the ALI

MODEL CODE OF PREARRAIGNMENT PROCEDURES &sect; 260.6 (1975). The Rule requires

that the observation making up the alleged plain view be "reasonable."

Whether intentional observation from outside a window, via flashlight or

binocular, for example, is observation in a "reasonable fashion"

is a question to be considered on a case by case basis. Whether a person

may properly enter upon private property in order to effect a seizure of

matter located via plain view is not resolved by the Rule and is left to

future case development. 

 _1984 Amendment:_ Subsection

(d)(5) was added based on _United States v. Place_, 462 U.S.

696 (1983). 

### (e) Power to seize.

Rule 316(e) conforms with Rule 315(e) and has its origin in Para.

19, MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _2013 Amendment._ In subsection (a), the committee recommended adding the word "reasonable" to align the rule with the language found in the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Mil. R. Evid. 314 and 315.

 In subsection (c)(5)(C), the committee intends that the term "reasonable fashion" include all action by law enforcement that the Supreme Court has established as lawful in its plain view doctrine. _See, e.g., Arizona v. Hicks_, 480 U.S. 321, 324-25 (1987) (holding that there was no search when an officer merely recorded serial numbers that he saw on a piece of stereo equipment, but that the officer did conduct a search when he moved the equipment to access serial numbers on the bottom of the turntable); _United States v. Lee_, 274 U.S. 559, 563 (1927) (use of a searchlight does not constitute a Fourth Amendment violation). It is not the committee's intent   to establish a stricter definition of plain view than that required by the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. An officer may seize the item only if his conduct satisfies the three-part test prescribed by the Supreme Court: (1) he does not violate the Fourth Amendment by arriving at the place where the evidence could be plainly viewed; (2) its incriminating character is "readily apparent"; and (3) he has a lawful right of access to the object itself. _Horton v. California_, 496 U.S. 128, 136-37 (1990).

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to ensure that it addressed admissibility rather than conduct. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis. In doing so, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 317. Interception of wire and oral communication

### (a) General Rule.

The area of interception of wire and oral communications is unusually

 complex and fluid. At present, the area is governed by the Fourth Amendment,

 applicable federal statute, DOD directive, and regulations prescribed by

the Service Secretaries. In view of this situation, it is preferable to refrain

 from codification and to vest authority for the area primarily in the Department

of Defense or Secretary concerned. Rule 317(c) thus prohibits interception

of wire and oral communications for law enforcement purposes by members of

the armed forces except as authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2516, Rule

317(b), and when applicable, by regulations issued by the Secretary of Defense

or the Secretary concerned. Rule 317(a), however, specifically requires exclusion

of evidence resulting form noncompliance with Rule 317(c) only when exclusion

is required by the Constitution or by an applicable statute. Insofar as a

violation of a regulation is concerned, _compare United States v.

Dillard_, 8 M.J. 213 (C.M.A. 1980) with _United States v.

Caceres_, 440 U.S. 741 (1979). 

### (b) Authorization for Judicial Applications in the United States.

Rule 317(b) is intended to clarify the scope of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2516

by expressly recognizing the Attorney General's authority to authorize applications

to a federal court by the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security,

or the military departments for authority to intercept wire or oral communications.

### (c) Regulations.

Rule 317(c) requires interception of wire or oral communications

in the United States be first authorized by statute, _see_ Rule

 317(b), and interceptions abroad by appropriate regulations. _ See

_ the Analysis to Rule 317(a), _supra_. The Committee

 intends 317(c) to limit only in interceptions that are non consensual under

 Chapter 119 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended moving former subsections (b) and (c)(3) to a discussion paragraph because they address conduct rather than the admissibility of evidence. _See supra_, General Provisions Analysis.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 

## Rule 321. Eyewitness identification

### (a) General Rule

#### (1) Admissibility.

The first sentence of Rule 321(a)(1) is the basic rule of admissibility

of eyewitness identification and provides that evidence of a relevant out-of-court

identification is admissible when otherwise admissible under the Rules. The

intent of the provision is to allow any relevant out-of-court identification

without any need to comply with the condition precedent such as in-court

identification, significant change from the prior rule as found in Para.

153 _a_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 The language "if

such testimony is otherwise admissible under these rules" is primarily

intended to ensure compliance with the hearsay rule. _See_ Rule 802. It should

be noted that Rule 801(d)(1)(C) states that a statement of "identification

of a person made after perceiving the person" is not hearsay when "the

declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination

concerning the statement." An eyewitness identification normally will

be admissible if the declarant testifies. The Rule's statement, "the

witness making the identification and any person who has observed the previous

identification may testify concerning it," is not an express exception

authorizing the witness to testify to an out-of-court identification notwithstanding

the hearsay rule, rather it is simply an indication that in appropriate circumstances, _

 see_ Rules 803 and 804, a witness to an out-of-court identification

may testify concerning it. 

 The last sentence of subdivision (a)(1)

is intended to clarify procedure by emphasizing that an in-court identification

may be bolstered by an out-of-court identification notwithstanding the fact

that the in-court identification has not been attacked. 

#### (2) Exclusionary rule.

Rule 321(a)(2) provides the basic exclusionary rule for eyewitness

 identification testimony. The substance of the Rule is taken from prior Manual

 paragraph 153 _a_ as modified by the new procedure for suppression

motions. _See_ Rules 304 and 311. Subdivision (a)(2)(A) provides

that evidence of an identification will be excluded if it was obtained as

a result of an "unlawful identification process conducted by the United

States or other domestic authorities" while subdivision (a)(2)(B) excludes

evidence of an identification if exclusion would be required by the due process

clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Under the burden of proof,

 subdivision (d)(2), an identification is not inadmissible if the prosecution

 proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the identification process

was not so unnecessarily suggestive, in light of the totality of the circumstances,

 as to create a very substantial likelihood of irreparable mistaken identity.

It is the unreliability of the evidence which is determinative. _

Manson v. Brathwaite_, 432 U.S. 98 (1977). "United States or

other domestic authorities" includes military personnel. 

 Although

it is clear that an unlawful identification may taint a later identification,

it is unclear at present whether an unlawful identification requires suppression

of evidence other than identification of the accused. Consequently, the Rule

requires exclusion of nonidentification derivative evidence only when the

Constitution would so require. 

### (b) Definition of "unlawful."

#### (1) Lineups and other identification processes.

Rule 321(b) defines "unlawful lineup or other identification

 processes." When such a procedure is conducted by persons subject to

the Uniform Code of Military Justice or their agents, it will be unlawful

if it is "unnecessarily suggestive or otherwise in violation of the

due process clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United

States as applied to members of the armed forces." The

expression "unnecessarily suggestive" itself is a technical one and refers

to an identification that is in violation of the due process clause because

it is unreliable. _See Manson v. Brathwaite, supra; Stovall v. Denno

_, 338 U.S. 292 (1967); _Neil v. Biggers_, 409 U.S.

188 (1972). _See also Foster v. California_, 394 U.S. 440

(1969). An identification is not unnecessarily suggestive in violation of

the due process clause if the identification process was not so unnecessarily

suggestive, in light of the totality of the circumstances, as to create a

very substantial likelihood of irreparable mistaken identity. _See

Manson v. Brathwaite, supra_, and subdivision (d)(2). 

 Subdivision

(1)(A) differs from subdivision (1)(B) only in that it recognizes that the

Constitution may apply differently to members of the armed forces than it

does to civilians. 

 Rule 321(b)(1) is applicable to all forms of

identification processes including showups and lineups. 

 _

1984 Amendment:_ Subsections (b)(1) and (d)(2) were modified to make

clear that the test for admissibility of an out-of-court identification is

reliability. _See Manson v. Brathwaite, supra._ This was apparently

the intent of the drafters of the former rule. _ See_ Analysis,

Mil. R. Evid. 321. The language actually used in subsection (b)(1) and (d)(2)

was subject to a different interpretation, however. _See_ S.

Salzburg, L. Schinasi, and D. Schlueter, MILITARY RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL

at 165-167 (1981); Richard Gasperini, _ Eyewitness Identification Under

the Military Rules of Evidence_, 1980 Army Law. 42, at 42. 

 In

determining whether an identification is reliable, the military judge should

weigh all the circumstances, including: the opportunity of the witness to

view the accused at the time of the offense; the degree of attention paid

by the witness; the accuracy of any prior descriptions of the accused by

the witness; the level of certainty shown by the witness in the identification;

 and the time between the crime and the confrontation. Against these factors

 should be weighed the corrupting effect of a suggestive and unnecessary

identification. _See Manson v. Brathwaite, supra; Neil v. Biggers,

 supra_. 

 Note that the modification of subsection (b)(1)

eliminates the distinction between identification processes conducted by

persons subject to the code and other officials. Because the test is the

reliability of the identification, and not a prophylactic standard, there

is no basis to distinguish between identification processes conducted by

each group. _See Manson v. Brathwaite, supra._ 

#### (2) Lineups: right to counsel.

Rule 321(b)(2) deals only with lineups. The Rule does declare that

a lineup is "unlawful" if it is conducted in violation of the

right to counsel. Like Rule 305 and 311, Rule 321(b)(2) distinguishes between

lineups conducted by persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice

or their agents and those conducted by others. 

 Subdivision (b)(2)(A)

is the basic right to counsel for personnel participating in military lineups.

A lineup participant is entitled to counsel only if that participant is in

pretrial restraint (pretrial arrest, restriction, or confinement) under paragraph

20 of the Manual or has had charges preferred against him or her. Mere apprehension

or temporary detention does not trigger the right to counsel under the Rule.

This portion of the Rule substantially changes military law and adapts the

Supreme Court's decision in _Kirby v. Illinois_, 406 U.S.

682, 689 (1972) (holding that the right to counsel attached only when "adversary

judicial criminal proceedings" have been initiated or "the government

has committed itself to prosecute") to unique military criminal procedure. _

See also_ Rule 305(d)(1)(B). 

 Note that _interrogation

_ of a suspect will require rights warnings, perhaps including a

warning of a right to counsel, even if counsel is unnecessary under Rule

321. _See_ Rule 305. 

 As previously noted, the Rule

does not define "lineup" and recourse to case law is necessary.

Intentional exposure of the suspect to one or more individuals for purpose

of identification is likely to be a lineup, _Stovall v. Denno_,

388 U.S. 293, 297 (1967), although in rare cases of emergency (_e.g.,

_ a dying victim) such an identification may be considered a permissible

"showup" rather than a "lineup." Truly accidental

confrontations between victims and suspects leading to an identification

by the victim are not generally considered "lineups";_

cf. United State ex rel Ragazzin v. Brierley_, 321 F.Supp. 440 (W.D.

Pa. 1970). Photographic identifications are not "lineups" for

purposes of the right to counsel. _United States v. Ash_,

413 U.S. 300, 301 n.2 (1973). If a photographic identification is used, however,

the photographs employed should be preserved for use at trial in the event

that the defense should claim that the identification was "unnecessarily

suggestive." _See subdivision_ (b)(1) _supra.

_ 

 A lineup participant who is entitled to counsel is entitled

to only one lawyer under the Rule and is specifically entitled to free military

 counsel without regard to the indigency or lack thereof of the participant.

No right to civilian counsel or military counsel of the participant's own

 selection exists under the Rule. _United States v. Wade_,

388 U.S. 218, n.27 (1967). A lineup participant may waive any applicable

right to counsel so long as the participant is aware of the right to counsel

and the waiver is made "freely, knowingly, and intelligently."

Normally a warning of the right to counsel will be necessary for the prosecution

to prove an adequate waiver should the defense adequately challenge the waiver. _

 See, e.g., United States v. Avers_, 426 F.2d 524 (2d Cir. 1970). _

See also_ Model Rules for Law Enforcement, Eye Witness Identification,

Rule 404 (1974) cited in E. IMWINKELRIED, P. GIANNELLI, F. GILLIGAN, &

F. LEDERER, CRIMINAL EVIDENCE 366 (1979). 

 _1984 Amendment:

_ In subsection (b)(2)(A), the words "or law specialist within

the meaning of Article 1" were deleted as unnecessary. _See

_ R.C.M. 103(26). 

 Subdivision (b)(2)(B) grants a right

to counsel at non-military lineups within the United States only when such

a right to counsel is recognized by "the principles of law generally

recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts

involving similar lineups." The Rule presumes that an individual participating

in a foreign lineup conducted by officials of a foreign nation without American

 participation has no right to counsel at such a lineup. 

### (c) Motions to suppress and objections.

Rule 321(c) is identical in application to Rule 311(d)._

 See_ the Analysis to Rules 304 and 311. 

### (d) Burden of proof.

Rule 321(d) makes it clear that when an eyewitness identification

is challenged by the defense, the prosecution need reply only to the specific

 cognizable defense complaint. _See also_ Rules 304 and 311.

The subdivision distinguishes between defense challenges involving alleged

 violation of the right to counsel and those involving the alleged unnecessarily

 suggestive identifications. 

#### (1) Right to counsel.

Subdivision (d)(1) requires that when an alleged violation of the

 right to counsel has been raised the prosecution must either demonstrate

by preponderance of the evidence that counsel was present or that the right

to counsel was waived voluntarily and intelligently. The Rule also declares

that if the right to counsel is violated at a lineup that results in an

identification of the accused any later identification is considered a result

 of the prior lineup as a matter of law unless the military judge determines

by clear and convincing evidence that the latter identification is not the

result of the first lineup. Subdivision (d)(1) is taken in substance from

1969 Manual Para. 153 _a_. 

#### (2) Unnecessarily suggestive identification.

Rule 321(d)(2) deals with an alleged unnecessarily suggestive identification

or with any other alleged violation of due process. The subdivision makes

it clear that the prosecution must show, when the defense has raised the

issue, that the identification in question was not based upon a preponderance

of the evidence, "so unnecessarily suggestive in light of the totality

of the circumstances, as to create a very substantial likelihood of irreparable

mistaken identity." This rule is taken from the Supreme Court's decisions

of _Neil v. Biggers_, 409 U.S. 188 (1972) and _Stovall

v. Denno,_ 388 U.S. 293 (1967), and unlike subdivision (d)(1), applies

to all identification processes whether lineups or not. The Rule recognizes

that the nature of the identification process itself may well be critical

to the reliability of the identification and provides for exclusion of unreliable

evidence regardless of its source. If the prosecution meets its burden, the

mere fact that the identification process was unnecessary or suggestive does

not require exclusion of the evidence, _Manson v. Brathwaite, supra.

_ 

 If the identification in question is subsequent to an

earlier, unnecessarily suggestive identification, the later identification

is admissible if the prosecution can show by clear and convincing evidence

that the later identification is not the result of the earlier improper examination.

This portion of the Rule is consistent both with 1969 Manual Para. 153 _

 a_ and _Kirby v. Illinois_, 406 U.S. 682 (1972).

### (e) Defense evidence.

Rule 321(e) is identical with the analogous provisions in Rules

304 and 311 and generally restates prior law. 

### (f) Rulings.

Rule 321(f) is identical with the analogous provisions in Rules

304 and 321 and substantially changes prior law. _See_ the

Analysis to Rule 304(d)(4). 

### (g) Effect of guilty plea.

Rule 321(g) is identical with the analogous provisions in Rules

304 and 311 and restates prior law.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

# Relevancy and its Limits

## Rule 401. Test for relevant evidence.

The definition of "relevant evidence" found within Rule

 401 is taken without change from the Federal Rule and is substantially similar

 in effect to that used by Para. 137, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The Rule's definition

 may be somewhat broader than the 1969 Manual's, as the Rule defines as relevant

 any evidence that has "any tendency to make the existence of any

 fact. . . more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence"

 while the 1969 Manual defines as "not relevant" evidence "too

 remote to have any appreciable probative value. . ." To the extent that

 the 1969 Manual's definition includes considerations of "legal relevance,"

those considerations are adequately addressed by such other Rules as Rules

403 and 609. _See_, E. IMWINKELRIED, P. GIANNELLI, F. GILLIGAN

& F. LEDERER, CRIMINAL EVIDENCE 62-65 (1979) (which, after defining

"logical relevance" as involving only probative value, states

at 63 that "under the rubric of [legal relevance,]

the courts have imposed an additional requirement that the item's probative

value outweighs any attendant probative dangers.") The Rule is similar

to the 1969 Manual in that it abandons any reference to "materiality"

in favor of a single standard of "relevance." Notwithstanding

the specific terminology used, however, the concept of materiality survives

in the Rule's condition that to be relevant evidence must involve a fact

"which is of consequence to the determination of the action."

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 402. General admissibility of relevant evidence.

Rule 402 is taken without significant change from the Federal Rule.

 The Federal Rule's language relating to limitations imposed by "the

 Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or

by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority"

has been replaced by material tailored to the unique nature of the Military

Rules of Evidence. Rule 402 recognizes that the Constitution may apply somewhat

differently to members of the armed forces than to civilians, and the Rule

deletes the Federal Rule's reference to "other rules prescribed by

the Supreme Court" because such Rules do not apply directly in courts-martial. _

See_ Rule 101(b)(2). 

 Rule 402 provides a general standard

by which irrelevant evidence is always inadmissible and by which relevant

evidence is generally admissible. Qualified admissibility of relevant evidence

is required by the limitations in Sections III and V and by such other Rules

as 403 and 609 which intentionally utilize matters such as degree of probative

value and judicial efficiency in determining whether relevant evidence should

be admitted. 

 Rule 402 is not significantly different in its effect

from Para. 137 of the 1969 Manual which it replaces, and procedures used

under the 1969 Manual in determining relevance generally remain valid. Offers

of proof are encouraged when items of doubtful relevance are proffered, and

it remains possible, subject to the discretion of the military judge, to

offer evidence "subject to later connection." Use of the latter

technique, however, must be made with great care to avoid the possibility

of bringing inadmissible evidence before the members of the court. 

 It

should be noted that Rule 402 is potentially the most important of the new

rules. Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Military Rules of Evidence

resolve all evidentiary matters; _see_ Rule 101(b). When specific

authority to resolve an evidentiary issue is absent, Rule 402's clear result

is to make relevant evidence admissible.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 403. Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of prejudice, confusion or

 waste of time

Rule 403 is taken without change from the Federal Rule of Evidence.

 The Rule incorporates the concept often known as "legal relevance," _see_ the Analysis to Rule 401, and provides that evidence

may be excluded for the reasons stated notwithstanding its character as relevant

 evidence. The Rule vests the military judge with wide discretion in determining

 the admissibility of evidence that comes within the Rule. 

 If

a party views specific evidence as being highly prejudicial, it may be possible

to stipulate to the evidence and thus avoid its presentation to the court

members. _United States v. Grassi_, 602 F.2d 1192 (5th Cir.

1979), a prosecution for interstate transportation of obscene materials,

illustrates this point. The defense offered to stipulate that certain films

 were obscene in order to prevent the jury from viewing the films, but the

 prosecution declined to join in the stipulation. The trial judge sustained

the prosecution's rejection of the stipulation and the Fifth Circuit upheld

the judge's decision. In its opinion, however, the Court of Appeals adopted

a case by case balancing approach recognizing both the importance of allowing

 probative evidence to be presented and the use of stipulations as a tool

to implement the policies inherent in Rule 403. Insofar as the latter is

 concerned, the court expressly recognized the power of a Federal district

judge to compel the prosecution to accept a defense tendered stipulation.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 404. Character evidence; crime or other acts.

### (a) Character evidence generally.

Rule 404(a) replaces 1969 Manual Para. 138 _

f_ and is taken without substantial change from the Federal Rule.

Rule 404(a) provides, subject to three exceptions, that character evidence

is not admissible to show that a person acted in conformity therewith. 

 Rule

404(a)(1) allows only evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the accused

to be offered in evidence by the defense. This is a significant change from

Para. 138 _f_ of the 1969 Manual which also allows

evidence of "general good character" of the accused to be received

in order to demonstrate that the accused is less likely to have committed

a criminal act. Under the new rule, evidence of general good character is

inadmissible because only evidence of a specific trait is acceptable. It

is the intention of the Committee, however, to allow the defense to introduce

evidence of good military character when that specific trait is pertinent.

Evidence of good military character would be admissible, for example, in

a prosecution for disobedience of orders. The prosecution may present evidence

of a character trait only in rebuttal to receipt in evidence of defense character

evidence. This is consistent with prior military law. 

 Rule 404(a)(2)

is taken from the Federal Rule with minor changes. The Federal Rule allows

the prosecution to present evidence of the character trait of peacefulness

of the victim "in a homicide case to rebut evidence that the victim

was the first aggressor." Thus, the Federal Rule allows prosecutorial

use of character evidence in a homicide case in which self-defense has been

raised. The limitation to homicide cases appeared to be inappropriate and

impracticable in the military environment. All too often, assaults involving

claims of self-defense take place in the densely populated living quarters

common to military life. Whether aboard ship or within barracks, it is considered

essential to allow evidence of the character trait of peacefulness of the

victim. Otherwise, a substantial risk would exist of allowing unlawful assaults

to go undeterred. The Federal Rule's use of the expression "first aggressor"

was modified to read "an aggressor," as substantive military

law recognizes that even an individual who is properly exercising the right

of self-defense may overstep and become an aggressor. The remainder of Rule

404(a)(2) allows the defense to offer evidence of a pertinent trait of character

of the victim of a crime and restricts the prosecution to rebuttal of that

trait. 

 Rule 404(a)(3) allows character evidence to be used to

impeach or support the credibility of a witness pursuant to Rules 607-609. 

_

 2004 Amendment:_ Subdivision (a) was modified based on the amendment

to Fed. R. Evid. 404(a), effective 1 December 2000, and is virtually identical

to its Federal Rule counterpart. It is intended to provide a more balanced

presentation of character evidence when an accused attacks the victim's character.

 The accused opens the door to an attack on the same trait of his own character

when he attacks an alleged victim's character, giving the members an opportunity

to consider relevant evidence about the accused's propensity to act in a certain

manner. The words "if relevant" are added to subdivision (a)(1)

to clarify that evidence of an accused's character under this rule must meet

the requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 401 and Mil. R. Evid. 403. The drafters

believe this addition addresses the unique use of character evidence in courts-martial.

 The amendment does not permit proof of the accused's character when the accused

attacks the alleged victim's character as a witness under Rule 608 or 609,

nor does it affect the standards for proof of character by evidence of other

sexual behavior or sexual offenses under Rules 412-415.

### (b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts.

Rule 404(b) is taken without change from the Federal Rule,

and is substantially similar to the 1969 Manual rule found in Para. 138 _

 g_. While providing that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts

is not admissible to prove a predisposition to commit a crime, the Rule expressly

 permits use of such evidence on the merits when relevant to another specific

 purpose. Rule 404(b) provides examples rather than a list of justifications

for admission of evidence of other misconduct. Other justifications, such

as the tendency of such evidence to show the accused's consciousness of guilt

of the offense charged, expressly permitted in Manual Para. 138 _

g_(4), remain effective. Such a purpose would, for example, be an

acceptable one. Rule 404(b), like Manual Para. 138 _g_,

expressly allows use of evidence of misconduct not amounting to conviction.

Like Para. 138 _ g_, the Rule does not, however,

deal with use of evidence of other misconduct for purposes of impeachment. _

See_ Rules 608-609. Evidence offered under Rule 404(b) is subject

to Rule 403. 

 _1994 Amendment._ The amendment

to Mil. R. Evid. 404(b) was based on the 1991 amendment to Fed. R. Evid.

404(b). The previous version of Mil. R. Evid. 404(b) was based on the now

superseded version of the Federal Rule. This amendment adds the requirement

that the prosecution, upon request by the accused, provide reasonable notice

in advance of trial, or during trial if the military judge excuses pretrial

notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it

intends to introduce at trial. Minor technical changes were made to the language

of the Federal Rule so that it conforms to military practice.

 _2013 Amendment._ The word "alleged" was added to references to the victim throughout this rule. Stylistic changes were also made to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but they were not intended to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 _2015 Amendment_: This rule was revised to implement Section 536 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291, 19 December 2014.

## Rule 405. Methods of proving character

### (a) Reputation or opinion.

Rule 405(a) is taken without change from the Federal Rule. The first

 portion of the Rule is identical in effect with the prior military rule found

 in Para. 138 _f_(1) of the 1969 Manual. An individual testifying

 under the Rule must have an adequate relationship with the community

 (_see_ Rule 405(c)), in the case of reputation, or with the given

individual in the case of opinion, in order to testify. The remainder of Rule

 405(a) expressly permits inquiry or cross-examination "into relevant

 specific instances of conduct." This is at variance with prior military

 practice under which such an inquiry was prohibited. _See_ Para. 138 _f_(2), MCM, 1969 (Rev.) (character of the accused).

 Reputation evidence is exempted from the hearsay rule, Rule 803(21). 

### (b) Specific instances of conduct.

Rule 405(b) is taken without significant change from the Federal

 Rule. Reference to "charge, claim, or defense" has been replaced

 with "offense or defense" in order to adapt the rule to military

 procedure and terminology. 

### (c) Affidavits.

Rule 405(c) is not found within the Federal Rules and is taken

verbatim from material found in Para. 146_b_ of the 1969 Manual.

 Use of affidavits or other written statements is required due to the world

wide disposition of the armed forces which makes it difficult if not impossible

to obtain witnesses-particularly when the sole testimony of a witness

is to be a brief statement relating to the character of the accused. This

is particularly important for offenses committed abroad or in a combat zone,

in which case the only witnesses likely to be necessary from the United States

are those likely to be character witnesses. The Rule exempts statements used

under it from the hearsay rule insofar as the mere use of an affidavit or

other written statement is subject to that rule. 

### (d) Definitions.

Rule 405(d) is not found within the Federal Rules of Evidence and

has been included because of the unique nature of the armed forces. The definition

 of "reputation" is taken generally from 1969 Manual Para. 138

 _f_(1) and the definition of "community" is an

 expansion of that now found in the same paragraph. The definition of "community"

has been broadened to add "regardless of size" to indicate that

a party may proffer evidence of reputation within any specific military organization,

whether a squad, company, division, ship, fleet, group, or wing, branch,

or staff corps, for example. Rule 405(d) makes it clear that evidence may

be offered of an individual's reputation in either the civilian or military

community or both.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 406. Habit; routine practice

Rule 406 is taken without change from the Federal Rule. It is similar

 in effect to Para. 138_h_ of the 1969 Manual. It is the intent

 of the Committee to include within Rule 406's use of the word, "organization,"

military organizations regardless of size. _ See_ Rule 405

and the Analysis to that Rule.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 407. Subsequent remedial measures

Rule 407 is taken from the Federal Rules without change, and has

no express equivalent in the 1969 Manual.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 408. Compromise offers and negotiations.

Rule 408 is taken from the Federal Rules without change, and has

no express equivalent in the 1969 Manual.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 409. Offers to pay medical and similar expenses.

Rule 409 is taken from the Federal Rules without change. It has

no present military equivalent and is intended to be applicable to courts-martial

 to the same extent that is applicable to civilian criminal cases. Unlike

Rules 407 and 408 which although primarily applicable to civil cases are

clearly applicable to criminal cases, it is arguable that Rule 409 may not

apply to criminal cases as it deals only with questions of "liability"-normally

only a civil matter. The Rule has been included in the Military Rules to

ensure its availability should it, in fact, apply to criminal cases.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 410. Pleas, plea discussions, and related statements.

Rule 410 as modified effective 1 August 1981 is generally taken

from the Federal Rule as modified on 1 December 1980. It extends to plea

bargaining as well as to statements made during a providency inquiry, civilian

or military. _E.g.,_ _United States v. Care,_ 18

C.M.A. 535 (1969). Subsection (b) was added to the Rule in recognition of

the unique possibility of administrative disposition, usually separation,

in lieu of court-martial. Denominated differently within the various armed

forces, this administrative procedure often requires a confession as a prerequisite.

As modified, Rule 410 protects an individual against later use of a statement

submitted in furtherance of such a request for administrative disposition.

The definition of "on the record" was required because no "record"

in the judicial sense exists insofar as request for administrative disposition

is concerned. It is the belief of the Committee that a copy of the written

 statement of the accused in such a case is, however, the functional equivalent

 of such a record. 

 Although the expression "false statement"

was retained in the Rule, it is the Committee's intent that it be construed

to include all related or similar military offenses.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 411. Liability Insurance

Rule 411 is taken from the Federal Rule without change. Although

it would appear to have potential impact upon some criminal cases,_

 e.g.,_ some negligent homicide cases, its actual application to

 criminal cases is uncertain. It is the Committee's intent that Rule 411 be

 applicable to courts-martial only to the extent that it is applicable to

 criminal cases.

 

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 

 

## Rule 412. Nonconsensual sexual offenses; relevance of victim's past behavior

Rule 412 is taken from the Federal Rules. Although substantially

 similar in substantive scope to Federal Rule of Evidence 412, the application

 of the Rule has been somewhat broadened and the procedural aspects of the

 Federal Rule have been modified to adapt them to military practice. 

 Rule

412 is intended to shield victims of sexual assaults from the often embarrassing

and degrading cross-examination and evidence presentations common to prosecutions

of such offenses. In so doing, it recognizes that the prior rule, which it

replaces, often yields evidence of at best minimal probative value with great

potential for distraction and incidentally discourages both the reporting

and prosecution of many sexual assaults. In replacing the unusually extensive

rule found in Para. 153 _b_ (2)(b), MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which

permits evidence of the victim's "unchaste" character regardless

of whether he or she has testified, the Rule will significantly change prior

military practice and will restrict defense evidence. The Rule recognizes,

however, in Rule 412(b)(1), the fundamental right of the defense under the

Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States to present relevant

defense evidence by admitting evidence that is "constitutionally required

to be admitted." Further, it is the Committee's intent that the Rule

not be interpreted as a rule of absolute privilege. Evidence that is constitutionally

required to be admitted on behalf of the defense remains admissible notwithstanding

the absence of express authorization in Rule 412(a). It is unclear whether

reputation or opinion evidence in this area will rise to a level of constitutional

magnitude, and great care should be taken with respect to such evidence. 

 Rule

412 applies to a "nonconsensual sexual offense" rather than only

to "rape or assault with intent to commit rape" as prescribed

by the Federal Rule. The definition of "nonconsensual sexual offense"

is set forth in Rule 412(e) and "includes rape, forcible sodomy, assault

with intent to commit rape or forcible sodomy, indecent assault, and attempts

to commit such offenses." This modification to the Federal Rule resulted

from a desire to apply the social policies behind the Federal Rule to the

unique military environment. Military life requires that large numbers of

young men and women live and work together in close quarters which are often

highly isolated. The deterrence of sexual offenses in such circumstances

is critical to military efficiency. There is thus no justification for limiting

the scope of the Rule, intended to protect human dignity and to ultimately

encourage the reporting and prosecution of sexual offenses, only to rape

and/or assault with intent to commit rape. 

 Rule 412(a) generally

prohibits reputation or opinion evidence of an alleged victim of a nonconsensual

sexual offense. 

 Rule 412(b)(1) recognizes that evidence of a victim's

past sexual behavior may be constitutionally required to be admitted. Although

there are a number of circumstances in which this language may be applicable,_

 see,_ S. Saltzburg & K. Redden, FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL

 92-93 (2d ed. Supp. 1979) (giving example of potential constitutional

 problems offered by the American Civil Liberties Union during the House

hearings on Rule 412), one may be of particular interest. If an individual

has contracted for the sexual services of a prostitute and subsequent to

the performance of the act the prostitute demands increased payment on pain

of claiming rape, for example, the past history of that person will likely

be constitutionally required to be admitted in a subsequent prosecution in

which the defense claims consent to the extent that such history is relevant

and otherwise admissible to corroborate the defense position. Absent such

peculiar circumstances, however, the past sexual behavior of the alleged

victim, not within the scope of Rule 412(b)(2), is unlikely to be admissible

regardless of the past sexual history. The mere fact that an individual is

a prostitute is not normally admissible under Rule 412. 

 Evidence

of past false complaints of sexual offenses by an alleged victim of a sexual

offense is not within the scope of this rule and is not objectionable when

otherwise admissible. 

 Rule 412(c) provides the procedural mechanism

by which evidence of past sexual behavior of a victim may be offered. The

Rule has been substantially modified from the Federal Rule in order to adapt

it to military practice. The requirement that notice be given not later than

fifteen days before trial has been deleted as being impracticable in view

of the necessity for speedy disposition of military cases. For similar reasons,

the requirement for a written motion has been omitted in favor of an offer

of proof, which could, of course, be made in writing, at the discretion of

the military judge. Reference to hearings in chambers has been deleted as

inapplicable; a hearing under Article 39(a), which may be without spectators,

has been substituted. The propriety of holding a hearing without spectators

is dependent upon its constitutionality which is in turn dependent upon the

facts of any specific case.

 Although Rule 412 is not _

per se_ applicable to such pretrial procedures as Article 32 and

Court of Inquiry hearings, it may be applicable via Rule 303 and Article

31(c). _See_ the Analysis to Rule 303.

 It should

be noted as a matter related to Rule 412 that the 1969 Manual's prohibition

in Para. 153 _a_ of convictions for sexual offenses that rest

on the uncorroborated testimony of the alleged victim has been deleted. Similarly,

an express hearsay exception for fresh complaint has been deleted as being

unnecessary. Consequently, evidence of fresh complaint will be admissible

under the Military Rule only to the extent that it is either nonhearsay, _

see_ Rule 801(d)(1)(B), or fits within an exception to the hearsay

rule. _See_ subdivisions (1), (2), (3), (4), and (24) of

Rule 803.

 _1993 Amendment._ R.C.M. 405(i) and Mil.

R. Evid. 1101(d) were amended to make the provisions of Rule 412 applicable

at pretrial investigations. Congress intended to protect the victims of nonconsensual

sex crimes at preliminary hearings as well as at trial when it passed Fed.

R. Evid. 412. _See_ Criminal Justice Subcommittee of the House

Judiciary Committee Report, 94th Cong., 2d Session, July 1976. 

 _

1998 Amendment._ The revisions to Rule 412 reflect changes made to

Federal Rule of Evidence 412 by section 40141 of the Violent Crime Control

and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub L. No. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796, 1918-19

(1994). The purpose of the amendments is to safeguard the alleged victim

against the invasion of privacy and potential embarrassment that is associated

with public disclosure of intimate sexual details and the infusion of sexual

innuendo into the factfinding process.

 The terminology "alleged

victim" is used because there will frequently be a factual dispute

as to whether the sexual misconduct occurred. Rule 412 does not, however,

apply unless the person against whom the evidence is offered can reasonably

be characterized as a "victim of alleged sexual misconduct." 

 The

term "sexual predisposition" is added to Rule 412 to conform

military practice to changes made to the Federal Rule. The purpose of this

change is to exclude all other evidence relating to an alleged victim of

sexual misconduct that is offered to prove a sexual predisposition. It is

 designed to exclude evidence that does not directly refer to sexual activities

 or thoughts but that the accused believes may have a sexual connotation for

the factfinder. Admission of such evidence would contravene Rule 412's objectives

 of shielding the alleged victim from potential embarrassment and safeguarding

 the victim against stereotypical thinking. Consequently, unless an exception

 under (b)(1) is satisfied, evidence such as that relating to the alleged

 victim's mode of dress, speech, or lifestyle is inadmissible. 

 In

drafting Rule 412, references to civil proceedings were deleted, as these

are irrelevant to courts-martial practice. Otherwise, changes in procedure

made to the Federal Rule were incorporated, but tailored to military practice.

 The Military Rule adopts a 5-day notice period, instead of the 14-day period

specified in the Federal Rule. Additionally, the military judge, for good

cause shown, may require a different time for such notice or permit notice

during trial. The 5-day period preserves the intent of the Federal Rule that

an alleged victim receive timely notice of any attempt to offer evidence

protected by Rule 412, however, given the relatively short time period between

referral and trial, the 5-day period is deemed more compatible with courts-martial

practice. 

 Similarly, a closed hearing was substituted for the

in camera hearing required by the Federal Rule. Given the nature of the

in camera procedure used in Military Rule of Evidence 505(i)(4), and that

an _in camera_ hearing in the district courts more closely resembles a closed

hearing conducted pursuant to Article 39(a), the latter was adopted as better

suited to trial by courts-martial. Any alleged victim is afforded a reasonable

 opportunity to attend and be heard at the closed Article 39(a) hearing.

The closed hearing, combined with the new requirement to seal the motion,

related papers, and the record of the hearing, fully protects an alleged

victim against invasion of privacy and potential embarrassment.

  _2007 Amendment_:  This amendment is intended to aid practitioners in applying the balancing test of Mil. R. Evid. 412.  Specifically, the amendment clarifies: (1) that under Mil. R. Evid. 412, the evidence must be relevant for one of the purposes highlighted in subdivision (b); (2) that in conducting the balancing test, the inquiry is whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the victim's privacy; and (3) that even if the evidence is admissible under Mil. R. Evid. 412, it may still be excluded under Mil. R. Evid. 403.  The proposed changes highlight current practice.  _See U.S. v. Banker_, 60 M.J. 216, 223 (2004) ("It would be illogical if the judge were to evaluate evidence 'offered by the accused' for unfair prejudice to the accused.  Rather, in the context of this rape shield statute, the prejudice in question is, in part, that to the privacy interests of the alleged victim).  _See also Sanchez_, 44 M.J. at 178 ("[I]n determining admissibility there must be a weighing of the probative value of the evidence against the interest of shielding the victim's privacy").

  Moreover, the amendment clarifies that Mil. R. Evid. 412 applies in all cases involving a sexual offense wherein the person against whom the evidence is offered can reasonably be characterized as a "victim of the alleged sexual offense."  Thus, the rule applies to:  "consensual sexual offense," "nonconsensual sexual offenses;" sexual offenses specifically proscribed under the U.C.M.J., e.g., rape, aggravated sexual assault, etc.; those federal sexual offenses DoD is able to prosecute under clause 3 of Article 134, U.C.M.J., e.g., 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2252A (possession of child pornography); and state sexual offenses DoD is able to assimilate under the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. &sect; 13).

 In 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces expressed concern with the constitutionality of the balancing test from Rule 412(c)(3) as amended in 2007.  _See United States v. Gaddis_, 70 M.J. 248 (C.A.A.F. 2011), _United States v. Ellerbrock_, 70 M.J. 314 (C.A.A.F. 2011).

 _2015 Amendment_: Rule 412(c)(2) was revised in accordance with L.R.M. v. Kastenberg, 72 M.J. 364 (C.A.A.F. 2013), and Section 534(c) of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291, 19 December 2014.

## Rule 413. Similar crimes in sexual offense cases.

_1998 Amendment._ This amendment is intended

to provide for more liberal admissibility of character evidence in criminal

cases of sexual assault where the accused has committed a prior act of sexual

 assault. 

 Rule 413 is nearly identical to its Federal Rule counterpart.

 A number of changes were made, however, to tailor the Rule to military practice.

 First, all references to Federal Rule 415 were deleted, as it applies only

to civil proceedings. Second, military justice terminology was substituted

where appropriate (e.g. accused for defendant, court-martial for case).

Third, the 5-day notice requirement in Rule 413(b) replaced a 15-day notice

requirement in the Federal Rule. A 5-day requirement is better suited to

military discovery practice. This 5-day notice requirement, however, is

not intended to restrict a military judge's authority to grant a continuance

under R.C.M. 906(b)(1).  Fourth, Rule 413(d) has been modified to include

violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Also, the phrase "without

consent" was added to Rule 413(d)(1) to specifically exclude the introduction

of evidence concerning adultery or consensual sodomy. Last, all incorporation

by way of reference was removed by adding subsections (e), (f), and (g).

 The definitions in those subsections were taken from title 18, United States

Code &sect;&sect; 2246(2)-2246(3), and 513(c)(5), respectively. 

 Although

the Rule states that the evidence "is admissible," the drafters

intend that the courts apply Rule 403 balancing to such evidence. Apparently,

this also was the intent of Congress. The legislative history reveals that

"the general standards of the rules of evidence will continue to apply,

including the restrictions on hearsay evidence and the court's authority

under evidence rule 403 to exclude evidence whose probative value is substantially

outweighed by its prejudicial effect."  140 Cong. Rec. S. 12,990 (daily

ed. Sept. 20, 1994) (Floor Statement of the Principal Senate Sponsor, Senator

Bob Dole, Concerning the Prior Crimes Evidence Rules for Sexual Assault and

 When "weighing the probative value

of such evidence, the court may, as part of its rule 403 determination, consider

or differences." Report of the Judicial Conference of the United States

 _

2002 Amendment:_ Federal Rule of Evidence 415, which created a similar

character evidence rule for civil cases, became applicable to the Military

Rules of Evidence on January 6, 1996, pursuant to Rule 1102. Federal Rule

415, however, is no longer applicable to the Military Rules of Evidence,

as stated in Section 1 of Executive Order, 2002 Amendments to the Manual

for Court-Martial, United States, (2000). Rule 415 was deleted because it

applies only to federal civil proceedings.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended changing the time requirement in subsection (b) to align with the time requirements in Mil. R. Evid. 412 and the Federal Rules of Evidence. This change is also in conformity with military practice in which the military judge may accept pleas shortly after referral and sufficiently in advance of trial. Additionally, the committee recommended revising subsection (d) to align with the Federal Rules of Evidence.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 414. Similar crimes in child-molestation cases.

_1998 Amendment._ This amendment is intended

to provide for more liberal admissibility of character evidence in criminal

cases of child molestation where the accused has committed a prior act of

sexual assault or child molestation. 

 Rule 414 is nearly identical

to its Federal Rule counterpart. A number of changes were made, however,

to tailor the Rule to military practice.  First, all references to Federal

Rule 415 were deleted, as it applies only to civil proceedings. Second,

military justice terminology was substituted where appropriate (e.g. accused

for defendant, court-martial for case). Third, the 5-day notice requirement

in Rule 414(b) replaced a 15-day notice requirement in the Federal Rule.

 A 5-day requirement is better suited to military discovery practice. This

5-day notice requirement, however, is not intended to restrict a military

judge's authority to grant a continuance under R.C.M. 906(b)(1).  Fourth,

Rule 414(d) has been modified to include violations of the Uniform Code of

Military Justice. Last, all incorporation by way of reference was removed

 by adding subsections (e), (f), (g), and (h). The definitions in those

subsections were taken from title 18, United States Code &sect;&sect; 2246(2),

 2246(3), 2256(2), and 513(c)(5), respectively.

 Although the Rule

states that the evidence "is admissible," the drafters intend

that the courts apply Rule 403 balancing to such evidence. Apparently, this

was also the intent of Congress. The legislative history reveals that "the

general standards of the rules of evidence will continue to apply, including

the restrictions on hearsay evidence and the court's authority under evidence

rule 403 to exclude evidence whose probative value is substantially outweighed

by its prejudicial effect."  140 Cong. Rec. S. 12,990 (daily ed. Sept.

20, 1994) (Floor Statement of the Principal Senate Sponsor, Senator Bob Dole,

Concerning the Prior Crimes Evidence Rules for Sexual Assault and Child Molestation

Cases).

 When "weighing the probative value of such evidence,

the court may, as part of its rule 403 determination, consider proximity

in time to the charged or predicate misconduct; similarity to the charged

or predicate misconduct; frequency of the other acts; surrounding circumstances;

relevant intervening events; and other relevant similarities or differences."

# PRIVILEGES

## Rule 501. Privilege in general.

Section V contains all of the privileges applicable to military

 criminal law except for those privileges which are found within Rules 301,

 Privilege Concerning Compulsory Self-Incrimination; Rule 302, Privilege

Concerning Mental Examination of an Accused; and Rule 303, Degrading Questions.

 Privilege rules, unlike other Military Rules of Evidence, apply in "investigative

hearings pursuant to Article 32; proceedings for vacation of suspension of

sentence under Article 72; proceedings for search authorization; proceedings

involving pretrial restraint; and in other proceedings authorized under the

Uniform Code of Military Justice of this Manual and not listed in rule 1101(a)." _

See_ Rule 1101(c); _see also_ Rule 1101(b). 

 In

contrast to the general acceptance of the proposed Federal Rules of Evidence

by Congress, Congress did not accept the proposed privilege rules because

a consensus as to the desirability of a number of specific privileges could

not be achieved. _See_ generally, S. Saltzburg & K. Redden,

FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL 200-201 (2d ed. 1977). In an effort

to expedite the Federal Rules generally, Congress adopted a general rule,

Rule 501, which basically provides for the continuation of common law in

the privilege area. The Committee deemed the approach taken by Congress in

the Federal Rules impracticable within the armed forces. Unlike the Article

 III court system, which is conducted almost entirely by attorneys functioning

 in conjunction with permanent courts in fixed locations, the military criminal

 legal system is characterized by its dependence upon large numbers of laymen,

 temporary courts, and inherent geographical and personnel instability due

to the worldwide deployment of military personnel. Consequently, military

law requires far more stability than civilian law. This is particularly true

 because of the significant number of non-lawyers involved in the military

 criminal legal system. Commanders, convening authorities, non-lawyer investigating

officers, summary court-martial officers, or law enforcement personnel need

specific guidance as to what material is privileged and what is not. 

 Section

V combines the flexible approach taken by Congress with respect to privileges

with that provided in the 1969 Manual. Rules 502-509 set forth specific

rules of privilege to provide the certainty and stability necessary for military

justice. Rule 501, on the other hand, adopts those privileges recognized

in common law pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 501 with some limitations.

Specific privileges are generally taken from those proposed Federal Rules

of Evidence which although not adopted by Congress were non-controversial,

or from the 1969 Manual. 

 Rule 501 is the basic rule of privilege.

In addition to recognizing privileges required by or provided for in the

Constitution, an applicable Act of Congress, the Military Rules of Evidence,

and the Manual for Courts-Martial, Rule 501(a) also recognizes privileges

"generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United

States district courts pursuant to Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence

insofar as the application of such principles in trials by court-martial

is practicable and not contrary to or inconsistent with the Uniform Code

of Military Justice, these rules, or this Manual." The latter language

is taken from 1969 Manual Para. 137. As a result of Rule 501(a)(4), the common

law of privileges as recognized in the Article III courts will be applicable

to the armed forces except as otherwise provided by the limitation indicated

above. Rule 501(d) prevents the application of a doctor-patient privilege.

Such a privilege was considered to be totally incompatible with the clear

interest of the armed forces in ensuring the health and fitness for duty

of personnel. _See_ 1969 Manual Para. 151 _c_ 

 It

should be noted that the law of the forum determines the application of privilege.

Consequently, even if a servicemember should consult with a doctor in a

jurisdiction with a doctor-patient privilege for example, such a privilege

is inapplicable should the doctor be called as a witness before the court-martial. 

 Subdivision

(b) is a non-exhaustive list of actions which constitute an invocation of

a privilege. The subdivision is derived from Federal Rule of Evidence 501

as originally proposed by the Supreme Court, and the four specific actions

listed are also found in the Uniform Rules of Evidence. The list is intentionally

non-exclusive as a privilege might be claimed in a fashion distinct from

those listed. 

 Subdivision (c) is derived from Federal Rule of

Evidence 501 and makes it clear that an appropriate representative of a political

jurisdiction or other organizational entity may claim an applicable privilege.

The definition is intentionally non-exhaustive. 

 _1999

Amendment:_ The privileges expressed in Rule 513 and Rule 302 and

the conforming Manual change in R.C.M. 706, are not physician-patient privileges

and are not affected by Rule 501(d).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 502. Lawyer-client privilege

### (a) General rule of privilege.

Rule 502(a) continues the substance of the attorney-client privilege

 found in Para. 151 _b_(2) of the 1969 Manual. The Rule does,

 however, provide additional detail. Subdivision (a) is taken verbatim from

 subdivision (a) of Federal Rule of Evidence 503 as proposed by the Supreme

 Court. The privilege is only applicable when there are "confidential

 communications made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional

legal services to the client." A mere discussion with an attorney does

not invoke the privilege when the discussion is not made for the purpose

of obtaining professional legal services. 

### (b) Definitions-

#### (1) Client.

Rule 502(b)(1) defines a "client" as an individual or

 entity who receives professional legal services from a lawyer or consults

a lawyer with a view to obtaining such services. The definition is taken

from proposed Federal Rule 503(a)(1) as Para. 151_b_(2) of

the 1969 Manual lacked any general definition of a client. 

#### (2) Lawyer.

Rule 502(b)(2) defines a "lawyer." The first portion

of the paragraph is taken from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 503(a)(2)

and explicitly includes any person "reasonably believed by the client

to be authorized" to practice law. The second clause is taken from

1969 Manual Para. 151 _b_(2) and recognizes that a "lawyer"

 includes "a member of the armed forces detailed, assigned, or otherwise

 provided to represent a person in a court-martial case or in any military

 investigation or proceeding" regardless of whether that person is in

fact a lawyer. _See_ Article 27. Thus an accused is fully

protected by the privilege even if defense counsel is not an attorney. 

 The

second sentence of the subdivision recognizes the fact, particularly true

during times of mobilization, that attorneys may serve in the armed forces

in a nonlegal capacity. In such a case, the individual is not treated as

an attorney under the Rule unless the individual fits within one of the three

specific categories recognized by the subdivision. Subdivision (b)(2)(B)

recognizes that a servicemember who knows that an individual is a lawyer

in civilian life may not know that the lawyer is not functioning as such

in the armed forces and may seek professional legal assistance. In such a

case the privilege will be applicable so long as the individual was "reasonably

believed by the client to be authorized to render professional legal services

to members of the armed forces." 

#### (3) Representative of a lawyer.

Rule 502(b)(3) is taken from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence

503(a)(3) but has been modified to recognize that personnel are "assigned"

within the armed forces as well as employed. Depending upon the particular

situation, a paraprofessional or secretary may be a "representative

of a lawyer." _See_ Para. 151 _b_(2)

of the 1969 Manual. 

#### (4) Confidential communication.

Rule 502(b)(4) defines a "confidential" communication

in terms of the intention of the party making the communication. The Rule

is similar to the substance of 1969 Manual Para. 151 _b_(2)

which omitted certain communications from privileged status. The new Rule

is somewhat broader than the 1969 Manual's provision in that it protects

information which is obtained by a third party through accident or design

when the person claiming the privilege was not aware that a third party

had access to the communication. Compare Rule Para. 151 _a_ of

the 1969 Manual. The broader rule has been adopted for the reasons set forth

in the Advisory Committee's notes on proposed Federal Rule 504(a)(4). The

provision permitting disclosure to persons in furtherance of legal services

or reasonably necessary for the transmission of the communication is similar

to the provision in the 1969 Manual for communications through agents. 

 Although

Para. 151 _c_ of the 1969 Manual precluded a claim of the

privilege when there is transmission through wire or radio communications,

the new Rules protect statements made via telephone, or, "if use of

such means of communication is necessary and in furtherance of the communication,"

by other "electronic means of communication." Rule 511(b). 

### (c) Who may claim the privilege.

Rule 502(c) is taken from proposed Federal Rule 503(b) and expresses

 who may claim the lawyer-client privilege. The Rule is similar to but slightly

 broader than Para. 151 _b_(2) of the 1969 Manual. The last

 sentence of the subdivision states that "the authority of the lawyer

to claim the privilege is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary." 

 The

lawyer may claim the privilege on behalf of the client unless authority to

do so has been withheld from the lawyer or evidence otherwise exists to show

that the lawyer lacks the authority to claim the privilege. 

### (d) Exceptions.

Rule 502(d) sets forth the circumstances in which the lawyer-client

 privilege will not apply notwithstanding the general application of the

privilege. 

 Subdivision (d)(1) excludes statements contemplating

the future commission of crime or fraud and combines the substance of 1969

Manual Para. 151 _b_(2) with proposed Federal Rule of Evidence

503(d). Under the exception a lawyer may disclose information given by a

client when it was part of a "communication (which) clearly contemplated

the future commission of a crime of fraud," and a lawyer may also disclose

 information when it can be objectively said that the lawyer's services "were

sought or obtained to commit or plan to commit what the client knew or reasonably

should have known to be a crime or fraud." The latter portion of the

exception is likely to be applicable only after the commission of the offense

while the former is applicable when the communication is made. 

 Subdivisions

(d)(2) through (d)(5) provide exceptions with respect to claims through the

same deceased client, breach of duty by lawyer of client, documents attested

by lawyers, and communications to an attorney in a matter of common interest

among joint clients. There were no parallel provisions in the 1969 Manual

for these rules which are taken from proposed Federal Rule 503(d). The provisions

are included in the event that the circumstances described therein arise

in the military practice.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 503. Communications to clergy

### (a) General rule of privilege.

Rule 503(a) states the basic rule of privilege for communications

to clergy and is taken from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 506(b) and

1969 Manual Para. 151_b_(2). Like the 1969 Manual, the Rule

protects communications to a clergyman's assistant in specific recognition

of the nature of the military chaplaincy, and deals only with communications

"made either as a formal act of religion or as a matter of conscience."

### (b) Definitions.

#### (1) Clergyman.

Rule 503(b)(1) is taken from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence

506(a)(1) but has been modified to include specific reference to a chaplain.

 The Rule does not define "a religious organization" and leaves

 resolution of that question to precedent and the circumstances of the case.

 "Clergyman" includes individuals of either sex. 

#### (2) Confidential.

Rule 503(b)(2) is taken generally from proposed Federal Rule of

 Evidence 506(a)(2) but has been expanded to include communications to a

clergyman's assistant and to explicitly protect disclosure of a privileged

 communication when "disclosure is in furtherance of the purpose of

the communication or to those reasonably necessary for the transmission of

the communication." The Rule is thus consistent with the definition

of "confidential" used in the lawyer-client privilege, Rule 502(b)(4),

 and recognizes that military life often requires transmission of communications

 through third parties. The proposed Federal Rule's limitation of the privilege

 to communications made "privately" was deleted in favor of the

 language used in the actual Military Rule for the reasons indicated. The

Rule is somewhat more protective than the 1969 Manual because of its application

to statements which although intended to be confidential are overheard by

others. _See_ Rule 502(b)(4) and 510(a) and the Analysis thereto.

 _2007 Amendment_:  The previous subsection (2) of Mil. R. Evid. 503(b) was renumbered subsection (3) and the new subsection (2) was inserted to define the term "clergyman's assistant."

### (c) Who may claim the privilege.

Rule 503(c) is derived from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 506(c)

 and includes the substance of 1969 Manual Para. 151 _b_(2)

which provided that the privilege may be claimed by the "penitent."

The Rule supplies additional guidance as to who may actually claim the privilege

 and is consistent with the other Military Rules of Evidence relating to

privileges. _See_ Rule 502(c); 504(b)(3); 505(c); 506(c).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 504. Husband-wife privilege

### (a) Spousal incapacity.

Rule 504(a) is taken generally from _Trammel v. United States

_, 445 U.S. 40 (1980) and significantly changes military law in this

area. Under prior law, _see_ 1969 Manual Para. 148 _

 e_, each spouse had a privilege to prevent the use of the other spouse

 as an adverse witness. Under the new rule, the_ witness'_ spouse

 is the holder of the privilege and may choose to testify or not to testify

as the witness' spouse sees fit. _But see_ Rule 504(c) (exceptions

 to the privilege). Implicit in the rule is the presumption that when a spouse

 chooses to testify against the other spouse the marriage no longer needs

the protection of the privilege. Rule 504(a) must be distinguished from Rule

 504(b), _Confidential communication made during marriage,_ which

 deals with communications rather than the ability to testify generally at

 trial. 

 Although the witness' spouse ordinarily has a privilege

to refuse to testify against the accused spouse, under certain circumstances

no privilege may exists, and the spouse may be compelled to testify. _

See_ Rule 504(c). 

### (b) Confidential communication made during marriage.

Rule 504(b) deals with communications made during a marriage and

is distinct from a spouse's privilege to refuse to testify pursuant to Rule

 504(a). _See_ 1969 Manual Para. 151_ b_(2).

#### (1) General rule of privilege.

Rule 504(b)(1) sets forth the general rule of privilege for confidential

spousal communications and provides that a spouse may prevent disclosure

of any confidential spousal communication made during marriage even though

the parties are no longer married at the time that disclosure is desired.

The accused may always require that the confidential spousal communication

be disclosed. Rule 504(b)(3). 

 No privilege exists under subdivision

(b) if the communication was made when the spouses were legally separated.

#### (2) Definition.

Rule 504(b)(2) defines "confidential" in a fashion

similar to the definition utilized in Rules 502(b)(4) and 503(b)(2). The word

 "privately" has been added to emphasize that the presence of

 third parties is not consistent with the spousal privilege, and the reference

to third parties found in Rules 502 and 503 has been omitted for the same

reason. Rule 504(b)(2) extends the definition of "confidential"

to statements disclosed to third parties who are "reasonably necessary

for transmission of the communication." This recognizes that circumstances

 may arise, especially in military life, where spouses may be separated by

great distances or by operational activities, in which transmission of a

 communication via third parties may be reasonably necessary. 

#### (3) Who may claim the privilege.

Rule 504(b)(3) is consistent with 1969 Manual Para. 151 _

 b_(2) and gives the privilege to the spouse who made the communication.

 The accused may, however, disclose the communication even though the communication

was made to the accused. 

### (c) Exceptions.

#### (1) Spouse incapacity only.

Rule 504(c)(1) provides exceptions to the spousal incapacity rule

of Rule 504(a). The rule is taken from 1969 Manual Para. 148 _e_

and declares that a spouse may not refuse to testify against the other spouse

 when the marriage has been terminated by divorce or annulment. Annulment

has been added to the present military rule as being consistent with its

purpose. Separation of spouses via legal separation or otherwise does not

affect the privilege of a spouse to refuse to testify against the other spouse.

For other circumstances in which a spouse may be compelled to testify against

the other spouse,_ see_ Rule 504(c)(2). 

 Confidential

communications are not affected by the termination of a marriage. 

#### (2) Spousal incapacity and confidential communications.

Rule 504(c)(2) prohibits application of the spousal privilege,

whether in the form of spousal incapacity or in the form of a confidential

 communication, when the circumstances specified in paragraph (2) are applicable.

Subparagraphs (A) and (C) deal with anti-marital acts, _ e.g.,_ acts

which are against the spouse and thus the marriage. The Rule expressly provides

that when such an act is involved a spouse may not refuse to testify. This

provision is taken from proposed Federal Rule 505(c)(1) and reflects in part

the Supreme Court's decision in _Wyatt v. United States_,

362 U.S. 525 (1960). _See also Trammel v. United States_,

445 U.S. 40, 46 n.7 (1980). The Rule thus recognizes society's overriding

interest in prosecution of anti-marital offenses and the probability that

a spouse may exercise sufficient control, psychological or otherwise, to

be able to prevent the other spouse from testifying voluntarily. The Rule

is similar to 1969 Manual Para. 148 _e_ but has deleted the

 Manual's limitation of the exceptions to the privilege to matters occurring

 after marriage or otherwise unknown to the spouse as being inconsistent with

 the intent of the exceptions. 

 Rule 504(c)(2)(B) is derived from

Para. 148 _e_ and 151 _b_(2) of the 1969 Manual.

The provision prevents application of the privileges as to privileged communications

if the marriage was a sham at the time of the communication, and prohibits

application of the spousal incapacity privilege if the marriage was begun

as a sham and is a sham at the time the testimony of the witness is to be

offered. Consequently, the Rule recognizes for purposes of subdivision (a)

that a marriage that began as a sham may have ripened into a valid marriage

at a later time. The intent of the provision is to prevent individuals from

marrying witnesses in order to effectively silence them.

 _2012 Amendment_:  Subdivision (c)(2)(D) was added by Executive Order 13593 to create an exception to the privilege when both parties have been substantial participants in illegal activity.

 _2007 Amendment_: (d) _Definition_.  Rule 504(d) modifies the rule and is intended to afford additional protection to children.  Previously, the term "a child of either," referenced in Rule 504(c)(2)(A), did not include a "de facto" child or a child who is under the physical custody of one of the spouses but lacks a formal legal parent-child relationship with at least one of the spouses.  _See U.S. v. McCollum_, 58 M.J. 323 (C.A.A.F. 2003).  Prior to this amendment, an accused could not invoke the spousal privilege to prevent disclosure of communications regarding crimes committed against a child with whom he or his spouse had a formal, legal parent-child relationship; however, the accused could invoke the privilege to prevent disclosure of communications where there was not a formal, legal parent-child relationship.  This distinction between legal and "de facto" children resulted in unwarranted discrimination among child victims and ran counter to the public policy of protecting children.  Rule 504(d) recognizes the public policy of protecting children by addressing disparate treatment among child victims entrusted to another.  The "marital communications privilege should not prevent 'a properly outraged spouse with knowledge from testifying against a perpetrator' of child abuse within the home regardless of whether the child is part of that family." _U.S. v. McCollum_, 58 M.J. 323, 342 n.6 (C.A.A.F. 2003) (citing _U.S. v. Bahe_, 128 F.3d 1440, 1446 (10th Cir. 1997)).

 _2011 Amendment._ Subsection (c)(2)(D) was added pursuant to Executive Order 13593 of December 13, 2011.

 _2013 Amendment._  The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 505. Classified information

Rule 505 is based upon H.R. 4745, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (1979),

which was proposed by the Executive Branch as a response to what is known

as the "graymail" problem in which the defendant in a criminal

 case seeks disclosure of sensitive national security information, the release

of which may force the government to discontinue the prosecution. The Rule

is also based upon the Supreme Court's discussion of executive privilege

in _United States v. Reynolds_, 345 U.S. 1 (1953), and _

United States v. Nixon_, 418 U.S. 683 (1974). The rule attempts to

balance the interests of an accused who desires classified information for

his or her defense and the interests of the government in protecting that

information. 

### (a) General rule of privilege.

Rule 505(a) is derived from _United States v. Reynolds_, _

supra_ and 1969 Manual Para. 151. Classified information is only

privileged when its "disclosure would be detrimental to the national

 security." 

 _1993 Amendment:_ The second

sentence was added to clarify that this rule, like other rules of privilege,

applies at all stages of all actions and is not relaxed during the sentencing

hearing under Mil. R. Evid. 1101(c). 

### (b) Definitions.

#### (1) Classified information.

Rule 505(b)(1) is derived from section 2 of H.R. 4745. The definition

 of "classified information" is a limited one and includes only

that information protected "pursuant to an executive order, statute,

or regulation," and that material which  constitutes restricted  data 

pursuant  to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 2014(y) (1976). 

#### (2) National security.

Rule 505(b)(2) is derived from section 2 of H.R. 4745. 

### (c) Who may claim the privilege.

Rule 505(c) is derived from Para. 151 of the 1969 Manual and is

 consistent with similar provisions in the other privilege rules. _

 See_ Rule 501(c). The privilege may be claimed only "by the

head of the executive or military department or government agency concerned"

 and then only upon "a finding that the information is properly classified

 and that disclosure would be detrimental to the national security."

 Although the authority of a witness or trial counsel to claim the privilege

is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary, neither a witness

nor a trial counsel may claim the privilege without prior direction to do

so by the appropriate department or agency head. Consequently, expedited

coordination with senior headquarters is advised in any situation in which

Rule 505 appears to be applicable. 

### (d) Action prior to referral of charges.

Rule 505(d) is taken from section 4(b)(1) of H.R. 4745. The provision

 has been modified to reflect the fact that pretrial discovery in the armed

 forces, prior to referral, is officially conducted through the convening

 authority. The convening authority should disclose the maximum amount of

 requested information as appears reasonable under the circumstances. 

### (e) Pretrial session.

Rule 505(e) is derived from section 3 of H.R. 4745. 

### (f) Action after referral of charges.

Rule 505(f) provides the basic procedure under which the government

 should respond to a determination by the military judge that classified

information "apparently contains evidence that is relevant and material

 to an element of the offense or a legally cognizable defense and is otherwise

 admissible in evidence." _See generally_ the Analysis

to Rule 507(d). 

 It should be noted that the government may submit

information to the military judge for _in camera_ inspection

pursuant to subdivision (i). If the defense requests classified information

that it alleges is "relevant and material" and the government

refuses to disclose the information to the military judge for inspection,

the military judge may presume that the information is in fact "relevant

and material." 

### (g) Disclosure of classified information to the accused.

Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Rule 505(g) are derived from section 4

of H.R. 4745. Paragraph (3) is taken from section 10 of H.R. 4745 but has

been modified in view of the different application of the Jencks Act, 18

U.S.C. &sect; 3500 (1976) in the armed forces. Paragraph (4) is taken from

sections 4(b)(2) and 10 of H.R. 4745. The reference in H.R. 4745 to a recess

has been deleted as being unnecessary in view of the military judge's inherent

authority to call a recess. 

 _ 1993 Amendment:_ Subsection

(g)(1)(D) was amended to make clear that the military judge's authority to

require security clearances extends to persons involved in the conduct of

the trial as well as pretrial preparation for it. The amendment requires

persons needing security clearances to submit to investigations necessary

to obtain the clearance. 

### (h) Notice of the accused's intention to disclose classified information.

Rule 505(h) is derived from section 5 of H.R. 4745. The intent of

the provision is to prevent disclosure of classified information by the defense

 until the government has had an opportunity to determine what position to

take concerning the possible disclosure of that information. Pursuant to

Rule 505(h)(5), failure to comply with subdivision (h) may result in a prohibition

 on the use of the information involved. 

 _ 1993 Amendment:

_ Subsection (h)(3) was amended to require specificity in detailing

the items of classified information expected to be introduced. The amendment

is based on _United States v. Collins_, 720 F.2d. 1195 (11th

Cir. 1983). 

### (i) In camera proceedings for cases involving classified information.

Rule 505(i) is derived generally from section 5 of H.R. 4745. The

 "_in camera_" procedure utilized in subdivision

(i) is generally new to military law. Neither the accused nor defense counsel

may be excluded from the _in camera_ proceeding. However,

nothing within the Rule requires that the defense be provided with a copy

of the classified material in question when the government submits such information

to the military judge pursuant to Rule 505(i)(3) in an effort to obtain an _

 in camera_ proceeding under this Rule. If such information has not

been disclosed previously, the government may describe the information by

generic category, rather than by identifying the information. Such description

is subject to approval by the military judge, and if not sufficiently specific

to enable the defense to proceed during the _in camera_ session,

 the military judge may order the government to release the information for

use during the proceeding or face the sanctions under subdivision (i)(4)(E). 

 _

 1993 Amendment:_ Subsection (i)(3) was amended to clarify that

the classified material and the government's affidavit are submitted only

 to the military judge. The word "only" was placed at the end

of the sentence to make it clear that it refers to "military judge"

rather than to "examination." The military judge is to examine

the affidavit and the classified information without disclosing it before

 determining to hold an _in camera_ proceeding as defined in

 subsection (i)(1). 

 The second sentence of subsection (i)(4)(B)

was added to provide a standard for admission of classified information in

sentencing proceedings. 

### (j) Introduction of classified information.

Rule 505(j) is derived from section 8 of H.R. 4745 and _

United States v. Grunden_, 2 M.J. 116 (C.M.A. 1977). 

 _

1993 Amendment:_ Subsection (j)(5) was amended to provide that the

military judge's authority to exclude the public extends to the presentation

of any evidence that discloses classified information, and not merely to

the testimony of witnesses. _See generally, United States v. Hershey

_, 20 M.J. 433 (C.M.A. 1985), _cert. denied,_ 474

U.S. 1062 (1986) (specifies factors to be considered in the trial judge's

 determination to close the proceedings). 

### (k) Security procedures to safeguard against compromise of classified

information disclosed to courts-martial.

Rule 505(k) is derived from section 9 of H.R. 4745.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended significantly restructuring this rule to bring greater clarity and regularity to military practice. The changes focus primarily on expanding the military judge's explicit authority to conduct ex parte pretrial conferences in connection with classified information and detailing when the military judge is required to do so, limiting the disclosure of classified information per order of the military judge, specifically outlining the process by which the accused gains access to and may request disclosure of classified information, and the procedures for using classified material at trial. The changes were intended to ensure that classified information is not needlessly disclosed while at the same time ensuring that the accused's right to a fair trial is maintained. Some of the language was adopted from the Military Commissions Rules of Evidence and the Classified Information Procedures Act.

## Rule 506. Government information other than classified information

### (a) General rule of privilege.

Rule 506(a) states the general rule of privilege for nonclassified

 government information. The Rule recognizes that in certain extraordinary

cases the government should be able to prohibit release of government information

 which is detrimental to the public interest. The Rule is modeled on Rule

505 but is more limited in its scope in view of the greater limitations applicable

 to nonclassified information. _Compare United States v. Nixon_,

 418 U.S. 683 (1974) with _United States v. Reynolds_, 345

U.S. 1 (1953). Rule 506 addresses those similar matters found in 1969 Manual

Para. 151 _b_(1) and 151 _b_(3). Under Rule

506(a) information is privileged only if its disclosure would be "detrimental

to the public interest." It is important to note that pursuant to Rule

 506(c) the privilege may be claimed only "by the head of the executive

or military department or government agency concerned" unless investigations

 of the Inspectors General are concerned. 

 Under Rule 506(a) there

is no privilege if disclosure of the information concerned is required by

an Act of Congress such as the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;

552 (1976). Disclosure of information will thus be broader under the Rule

than under the 1969 Manual. _See_ _United States v.

Nixon_, _supra_. 

### (b) Scope.

Rule 506(b) defines "Government information" in a nonexclusive

fashion, and expressly states that classified information and information

relating to the identity of informants are solely within the scope of other

Rules. 

### (c) Who may claim the privilege.

Rule 506(c) distinguishes between government information in general

 and investigations of the Inspectors General. While the privilege for the

 latter may be claimed "by the authority ordering the investigation

or any superior authority," the privilege for other government information

may be claimed _only_ "by the head of the executive

or military department or government agency concerned." _See

 generally_ the Analysis to Rule 505(c). 

 _1990

Amendment:_ Subsection (c) was amended by substituting the words

"records and information" for "investigations", which

is a term of art vis-a-vis Inspector General functions. Inspectors General

also conduct "inspections" and "inquiries," and use

of the word "records and information" is intended to cover all

documents and information generated by or related to the activities of Inspectors

General. "Records" includes reports of inspection, inquiry, and

investigation conducted by an Inspector General and extracts, summaries,

exhibits, memoranda, notes, internal correspondence, handwritten working

materials, untranscribed shorthand or stenotype notes of unrecorded testimony,

tape recordings and other supportive records such as automated data extracts.

In conjunction with this change, the language identifying the official entitled

to claim the privilege for Inspector General records was changed to maintain

the previous provision which allowed the superiors of Inspector General officers,

rather than the officers themselves, to claim the privilege. 

### (d) Action prior to referral of charges.

Rule 506(d) specifies action to be taken prior to referral of charges

 in the event of a claim of privilege under the Rule. _See generally

_ Rule 505(d) and its Analysis. Note that disclosures can be withheld

only if action under paragraph (1)-(4) of subdivision (d) cannot be

made "without causing identifiable damage to the public interest"

(emphasis added). 

### (e) Action after referral of charges.

 _See generally_ Rule 505(f) and its Analysis. Note

that unlike Rule 505(f), however, Rule 506(e) does not require a finding

that failure to disclose the information in question "would materially

prejudice a substantial right of the accused." Dismissal is required

when the relevant information is not disclosed in a "reasonable period

of time." 

 _1995 Amendment:_ It is the intent

of the Committee that if classified information arises during a proceeding

under Rule 506, the procedures of Rule 505 will be used. 

 The

new subsection (e) was formerly subsection (f). The matters in the former

subsection (f) were adopted without change. The former subsection (e) was

amended and redesignated as subsection (f) (see below). 

### (f) Pretrial session.

Rule 506(f) is taken from Rule 505(e). It is the intent of the

Committee that if classified information arises during a proceeding under

Rule 506, the procedures of Rule 505 will be used. 

 _1995

Amendment:_ _See generally_ Rule 505(f) and its accompanying

Analysis. Note that unlike Rule 505(f), however, Rule 506(f) does not require

a finding that failure to disclose the information in question "would

materially prejudice a substantial right of the accused." Dismissal

is not required when the relevant information is not disclosed in a "reasonable

period of time." 

 Subsection (f) was formerly subsection

(e). The subsection was amended to cover action after a defense motion for

discovery, rather than action after referral of charges. The qualification

that the government claim of privilege pertains to information "that

apparently contains evidence that is relevant and necessary to an element

of the offense or a legally cognizable defense and is otherwise admissible

in evidence in a court-martial proceeding" was deleted as unnecessary.

 Action by the convening authority is required if, after referral, the defense

moves for disclosure and the Government claims the information is privileged

from disclosure. 

### (g) Disclosure of government information to the accused.

Rule 506(g) is taken from Rule 505(g) but deletes references to

 classified information and clearances due to their inapplicability. 

### (h) Prohibition against disclosure.

Rule 506(h) is derived from Rule 505(h)(4). The remainder of Rule

 505(h)(4) and Rule 505(h) generally has been omitted as being unnecessary.

No sanction for violation of the requirement has been included. 

 _

1995 Amendment:_ Subsection (h) was amended to provide that government

information may not be disclosed by the accused unless authorized by the

military judge. 

### (i) In camera proceedings.

Rule 506(i) is taken generally from Rule 505(i), but the standard

 involved reflects 1969 Manual Para. 151 and the Supreme Court's decision

in _United States v. Nixon_, _supra_. In line

 with_ Nixon_, the burden is on the party claiming the privilege

 to demonstrate why the information involved should not be disclosed. References

 to classified material have been deleted as being inapplicable. 

 _

1995 Amendment:_ Subsection (i) was amended to clarify the procedure

for in camera proceedings. The definition in subsection (i)(1) was amended

to conform to the definition of in camera proceedings in Mil. R. Evid. 505(i)(1).

 Subsections (i)(2) and (i)(3) were unchanged. Subsection (i)(4)(B), redesignated

as (i)(4)(C), was amended to include admissible evidence relevant to punishment

of the accused, consistent with _Brady v. Maryland_, 373 U.S.

83, 87 (1963). Subsection (i)(4)(C) was redesignated as (i)(4)(D), but was

otherwise unchanged. The amended procedures provide for full disclosure

of the government information in question to the accused for purposes of

litigating the admissibility of the information in the protected environment

of the in camera proceeding; _i.e._, the Article 39(a) session

is closed to the public and neither side may disclose the information outside

the in camera proceeding until the military judge admits the information

as evidence in the trial. Under subsection (i)(4)(E), the military judge

may authorize alternatives to disclosure, consistent with a military judge's

 authority concerning classified information under Mil. R. Evid. 505. Subsection

(i)(4)(F) allows the Government to determine whether the information ultimately

will be disclosed to the accused. However, the Government's continued objection

to disclosure may be at the price of letting the accused go free, in that

subsection (i)(4)(F) adopts the sanctions available to the military judge

under Mil. R. Evid. 505(i)(4)(E). _See United States v. Reynolds_,

345 U.S. 1, 12 (1953). 

### (k) Introduction of government information subject to a claim of privilege.

Rule 506(k) is derived from Rule 505(j) with appropriate modifications

being made to reflect the nonclassified nature of the information involved. 

 _

1995 Amendment:_ Subsection (j) was added to recognize the Government's

right to appeal certain rulings and orders. _ See_ R.C.M. 908.

 The former subsection (j) was redesignated as subsection (k). The subsection

speaks only to government appeals; the defense still may seek extraordinary

relief through interlocutory appeal of the military judge's orders and rulings. _

See generally_, 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1651(a); _Waller v. Swift

_, 30 M.J. 139 (C.M.A. 1990); _Dettinger v. United States

_, 7 M.J. 216 (C.M.A. 1979). 

### (l) Procedures to safeguard against compromise of government information

 disclosed to courts-martial.

Rule 506(k) is derived from Rule 505(k). Such procedures should

 reflect the fact that material privileged under Rule 506 is not classified.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended significantly revising this rule to bring greater clarity to it and also to align it with changes made to Mil. R. Evid. 505.

## Rule 507. Identity of informants.

### (a) Rule of privilege.

Rule 507(a) sets forth the basic rule of privilege for informants

and contains the substance of 1969 Manual Para. 151 _b_(1).

The new Rule, however, provides greater detail as to the application of the

privilege than did the 1969 manual. 

 The privilege is that of

the United States or political subdivision thereof and applies only to information

relevant to the identity of an informant. An "informant" is simply

an individual who has supplied "information resulting in an investigation

of a possible violation of law" to a proper person and thus includes

good citizen reports to command or police as well as the traditional "confidential

 informants" who may be consistent sources of information. 

### (b) Who may claim the privilege.

Rule 507(b) provides for claiming the privilege and distinguishes

 between representatives of the United States and representatives of a state

or subdivision thereof. Although an appropriate representative of the United

 States may always claim the privilege when applicable, a representative of

a state or subdivision may do so only if the information in question was

supplied to an officer of the state or subdivision. The Rule is taken from

proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 510(b), with appropriate modifications,

and is similar in substances to Para. 151 _b_(1) of the 1969

Manual which permitted "appropriate governmental authorities"

to claim the privilege. 

 The Rule does not specify who an "appropriate

 representative" is. Normally, the trial counsel is an appropriate

representative of the United States. The Rule leaves the question open, however,

for case by case resolution. Regulations could be promulgated which could

specify who could be an appropriate representative. 

### (c) Exceptions.

Rule 507(c) sets forth the circumstances in which the privilege

is inapplicable. 

#### (1) Voluntary disclosures; informant as witness.

Rule 507(c)(1) makes it clear that the privilege is inapplicable

if circumstances have nullified its justification for existence. Thus, there

is no reason for the privilege, and the privilege is consequently inapplicable,

if the individual who would have cause to resent the informant has been made

aware of the informant's identity by a holder of the privilege or by the

informant's own action or when the witness testifies for the prosecution

thus allowing that person to ascertain the informant's identity. This is

in accord with the intent of the privilege which is to protect informants

from reprisals. The Rule is taken from Para. 151 _b_(1) of

the 1969 Manual. 

#### (2) Testimony on the issue of guilt or innocence.

Rule 507(c)(2) is taken from 1969 Manual Para. 151 _b_ (1)

and recognizes that in certain circumstances the accused may have a due process

right under the Fifth Amendment, as well as a similar right under the Uniform

Code of Military Justice, to call the informant as a witness. The subdivision

intentionally does not specify what circumstances would require calling the

informant and leaves resolution of the issue to each individual case. 

#### (3) Legality of obtaining evidence.

Rule 507(c)(3) is new. The Rule recognizes that circumstances may

 exist in which the Constitution may require disclosure of the identity of

an informant in the context of determining the legality of obtaining evidence

 under Rule 311; _see_, _e.g., Franks v. Delaware_,

438 U.S. 154, 170 (1978); _McCray v. Illinois_, 386 U.S. 300

(1976) (both cases indicate that disclosure may be required in certain unspecified

 circumstances but do not in fact require such disclosure). In view of the

 highly unsettled nature of the issue, the Rule does not specify whether or

when such disclosure is mandated and leaves the determination to the military

judge in light of prevailing case law utilized in the trial of criminal cases

in the Federal district courts. 

### (d) Procedures.

Rule 507(d) sets forth the procedures to be followed in the event

of a claim of privilege under Rule 507. If the prosecution elects not to

disclose the identity of an informant when the judge has determined that

disclosure is required, that matter shall be reported to the convening authority.

Such a report is required so that the convening authority may determine what

action, if any, should be taken. Such actions could include disclosure of

the informant's identity, withdrawal of charges, or some appropriate appellate

 action.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended adding subsection (b) to define terms that are used throughout the rule and adding subsection (e)(1) to permit the military judge to hold an in camera review upon request by the prosecution. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 

## Rule 508. Political vote

Rule 508 is taken from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 507 and

 expresses the substance of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 596, which is applicable

to the armed forces. The privilege is considered essential for the armed

forces because of the unique nature of military life. 

## Rule 509. Deliberation of courts and juries

Rule 509 is taken from 1969 Manual Para. 151 but has been modified

to ensure conformity with Rule 606(b) which deals specifically with disclosure

of deliberations in certain cases.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended adding the language "courts-martial, military judges" to this rule in light of CAAF's holding in _United States v. Matthews_, 68 M.J. 29 (C.A.A.F. 2009). In that case, CAAF held that this rule as it was previously written created an implied privilege that protected the deliberative process of a military judge from disclosure and that testimony that revealed the deliberative thought process of the military judge is inadmissible. _Matthews_, 68 M.J. at 38-43. The changes simply express what the court found had previously been implied.

## Rule 510. Waiver of privilege by voluntary disclosure

Rule 510 is derived from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 511 and

is similar in substance to 1969 Manual Para. 151 _a_ which

notes that privileges may be waived. Rule 510(a) simply provides that "disclosure

of any significant part of the matter or communication under such circumstances

that it would be inappropriate to claim the privilege" will defeat

and waive the privilege. Disclosure of privileged matter may be, however,

itself privileged; _see_ Rules 502(b)(4); 503(b)(2); 504(b)(2).

Information disclosed in the form of an otherwise privileged telephone call

(_e.g.,_ information overheard by an operator) is privileged,

Rule 511(b), and information disclosed via transmission using other forms

of communication may be privileged; Rule 511(b). Disclosure under certain

 circumstances may not be "inappropriate" and the information

will retain its privileged character. Thus, disclosure of an informant's

identity by one law enforcement agency to another may well be appropriate

and not render Rule 507 inapplicable. 

 Rule 510(b) is taken from

Para. 151 _b_(1) of the 1969 Manual and makes it clear that

testimony pursuant to a grant of immunity does not waive the privilege. Similarly,

an accused who testifies in his or her own behalf does not waive the privilege

unless the accused testifies voluntarily to the privileged matter of communication.

## Rule 511. Privileged matter disclosed under compulsion or without opportunity

to claim privilege

Rule 511(a) is similar to proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 512.

 Placed in the context of the definition of "confidential" utilized

 in the privilege rules, _see,_ Rule 502(b)(4), the Rule is

 substantially different from prior military law inasmuch as prior law permitted

 utilization of privileged information which had been gained by a third party

 through accident or design. _See_ Para. 151 _b_ (1),

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Such disclosures are generally safeguarded against via

the definition "confidential" used in the new Rules. Generally,

the Rules are more protective of privileged information than was the 1969

Manual. 

 Rule 511(b) is new and deals with electronic transmission

of information. It recognizes that the nature of the armed forces today often

 requires such information transmission. Like 1969 Manual Para. 151 _

 b_(1), the new Rule does not make a nonprivileged communication

privileged; rather, it simply safeguards already privileged information under

 certain circumstances. 

 The first portion of subdivision (b) expressly

provides that otherwise privileged information transmitted by telephone remains

privileged. This is in recognition of the role played by the telephone in

modern life and particularly in the armed forces where geographical separations

are common. The Committee was of the opinion that legal business cannot be

transacted in the 20th century without customary use of the telephone. Consequently,

privileged communications transmitted by telephone are protected even though

those telephone conversations are known to be monitored for whatever purpose. 

 Unlike

telephonic communications, Rule 511(b) protects other forms of electronic

communication only when such means "is necessary and in furtherance

of the communication." It is irrelevant under the Rule as to whether

the communication in question was in fact necessary. The only relevant question

is whether, once the individual decided to communicate, the _ means

_ of communication was necessary and in furtherance of the communication.

Transmission of information by radio is a means of communication that must

be tested under this standard.

 _2013 Amendment._ Titles were added to the subsections of this rule for clarity and ease of use.

## Rule 512. Comment upon or inference from claim of privilege; instruction

### (a) Comment or inference not permitted.

Rule 512(a) is derived from proposed Federal Rule 513. The Rule

is new to military law but is generally in accord with the Analysis of Contents

of the 1969 Manual; United States Department of the Army, Pamphlet No. 27-2,

 Analysis of Contents, Manual for Courts-Martial 1969, _Revised Edition,

_ 27-33, 27-38 (1970). 

 Rule 512(a)(1) prohibits

any inference or comment upon the exercise of a privilege by the accused

and is taken generally from proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 513(a). 

 Rule

512(a)(2) creates a qualified prohibition with respect to any inference or

comment upon the exercise of a privilege by a person not the accused. The

Rule recognizes that in certain circumstances the interests of justice may

require such an inference and comment. Such a situation could result, for

example, when the government's exercise of a privilege has been sustained,

and an inference adverse to the government is necessary to preserve the fairness

of the proceeding. 

### (b) Claiming privilege without knowledge of members.

Rule 512(b) is intended to implement subdivision (a). Where possible,

 claims of privilege should be raised at an Article 39(a) session or, if

practicable, at sidebar. 

### (c) Instruction.

Rule 512(c) requires that relevant instructions be given "upon

 request." _Cf._ Rule 105. The military judge does not

have a duty to instruct _sua sponte._ 

## Rule 513. Psychotherapist-patient privilege

 _1999 Amendment:_ Military Rule of Evidence 513

establishes a psychotherapist-patient privilege for investigations or proceedings

authorized under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Rule 513 clarifies

military law in light of the Supreme Court decision in _Jaffee v.

Redmond_, 518 U.S. 1, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 135 L.Ed.2d 337 (1996). _

Jaffee_ interpreted Federal Rule of Evidence 501 to create a federal

 psychotherapist-patient privilege in civil proceedings and refers federal

 courts to state laws to determine the extent of privileges. In deciding to

 adopt this privilege for courts-martial, the committee balanced the policy

of following federal law and rules, when practicable and not inconsistent

with the UCMJ or MCM, with the needs of commanders for knowledge of certain

types of information affecting the military. The exceptions to the rule have

been developed to address the specialized society of the military and separate

 concerns that must be met to ensure military readiness and national security.

 _See Parker v. Levy_, 417 U.S. 733, 743 (1974); _U.S.

ex rel. Toth v. Quarles_, 350 U.S. 11, 17 (1955); _Dept. of

the Navy v. Egan_, 484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988). There is no intent to

apply Rule 513 in any proceeding other than those authorized under the UCMJ.

Rule 513 was based in part on proposed Fed. R. Evid. 504 (not adopted) and

state rules of evidence. Rule 513 is not a physician-patient privilege. It

is a separate rule based on the social benefit of confidential counseling

 recognized by _Jaffee_, and similar to the clergy-penitent privilege. In keeping

 with American military law since its inception, there is still no physician-patient

privilege for members of the Armed Forces. _See_ the analyses

for Rule 302 and Rule 501. 

### (a) General rule of privilege.

The words "under the UCMJ" in this rule mean Rule 513

 applies only to UCMJ proceedings, and do not limit the availability of such

 information internally to the services, for appropriate purposes. 

### (d) Exceptions

These exceptions are intended to emphasize that military commanders

 are to have access to all information that is necessary for the safety and

 security of military personnel, operations, installations, and equipment.

 Therefore, psychotherapists are to provide such information despite a claim

of privilege.

 _2012 Amendment:_ Executive Order 13593 removed communications about spouse abuse as an exception to the privilege by deleting the words "spouse abuse" and "the person of the other spouse or" from Rule 513(d)(2), thus expanding the overall scope of the privilege.  In removing the spouse abuse exception to Rule 513, the privilege is now consistent with Rule 514 in that spouse victim communications to a provider who qualifies as both a psychotherapist for purposes of Rule 513 and victim advocate for purposes of Mil. R. Evid. 514 are covered by the privilege.

 _2011 Amendment._ In Executive Order 13593 of December 13, 2011, the President removed  communications  about spouse abuse as an exception to the spousal privilege by deleting the words "spouse abuse" and "the person of the other spouse or" from Mil. R. Evid. 513(d)(2), thus expanding the overall scope of the privilege. The privilege is now consistent with Mil. R. Evid. 514 in that spouse victim communications to a provider who qualifies as both a psychotherapist for purposes of Mil. R. Evid. 513 and as a victim advocate for purposes of Mil. R. Evid. 514 are covered.

 _2013 Amendment._ In subsection (e)(3), the committee recommended changing the language to further expand the military judge's authority and discretion to conduct in camera reviews. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 _2015 Amendment_: Rule 513(e)(2) was revised in accordance with _L.R.M. v. Kastenberg_, 72 M.J. 364 (C.A.A.F. 2013), and Sections 534(c) and 537 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291, 19 December 2014.

## Rule 514. Victim advocate-victim privilege

_2012 Amendment:_ Like the psychotherapist-patient privilege created by Rule 513, Rule 514 establishes a victim advocate-victim privilege for investigations or proceedings authorized under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Implemented as another approach to improving the military's overall effectiveness in addressing the crime of sexual assault, facilitating candor between victims and victim advocates, and mitigating the impact of the court-martial process on victims, the rule specifically emerged in response to concerns raised by members of Congress, community groups, and _The Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services_ (DTFSAMS).  In its 2009 report, DTFSAMS noted the following: 35 states had a privilege for communications between victim advocates and victims of sexual assault; victims did not believe they could communicate confidentially with medical and psychological support services provided by DoD; victims perceived interference with the victim-victim advocate relationship and continuing victim advocate services when the victim advocate was identified as a potential witness in a court-martial; and service members reported being "re-victimized" when their prior statements to victim advocates were used to cross-examine them in court-martial proceedings. DTFSAMS recommended that Congress "enact a comprehensive military justice privilege for communications between a Victim Advocate and a victim of sexual assault." Both the DoD Joint Service Committee on Military Justice and Congress began considering a privilege. The Committee modeled proposed Rule 514 after Rule 513, including its various exceptions, in an effort to balance the privacy of the victim's communications with a victim advocate against the accused's legitimate needs. Differing proposals for a victim advocate privilege were suggested as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2011 (NDAA), but were not enacted. A victim advocate privilege passed the House of Representatives as part of the NDAA for 2012, while the Senate version required the President to issue a Military Rule of Evidence providing a privilege.  Congress removed both provisions because Rule 514 was pending the President's signature and Congress was satisfied that once implemented, this Rule accomplished the objective of ensuring privileged communications for sexual assault victims.

### (a) General rule of privilege.

The words "under the UCMJ" in Rule 514 mean that the privilege only applies to UCMJ proceedings.  It does not apply in situations in which the offender cannot be prosecuted under the UCMJ. Furthermore, this Rule only applies to communications between a victim advocate and the victim of a sexual or violent offense.

### (b) Definitions.

The Committee intended the definition of "victim advocate" from Rule 514 to include, but not be limited to, personnel performing victim advocate duties within the DoD Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (such as a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator), and the DoD Family Advocacy Program (such as a domestic abuse victim advocate).  A victim liaison appointed pursuant to the Victim and Witness Assistance Program is not a "victim advocate" for purposes of this Rule, nor are personnel working within an Equal Opportunity or Inspector General office.  For purposes of this Rule, the Committee intended "violent offense" to mean an actual or attempted murder, manslaughter, rape, sexual assault, aggravated assault, robbery, assault consummated by a battery and similar offenses.  A simple assault may be a violent offense where the violence has been physically attempted or menaced.  A mere threatening in words is not a violent offense.  The Committee recognizes that this Rule will be applicable in situations where there is a factual dispute as to whether a sexual or violent offense occurred and whether a person actually suffered direct physical or emotional harm of such an offense. The fact that such findings have not been judicially established shall not prevent application of this Rule to alleged victims reasonably intended to be covered by this Rule.

### (d) Exceptions.

The exceptions to Rule 514 are similar to the exceptions found in Rule 513, and are intended to be applied in the same manner. Rule 514 does not include comparable exceptions found within Rule 513(d)(2) and 513(d)(7). In drafting the "constitutionally required" exception, the Committee intended that communication covered by the privilege would be released only in the narrow circumstances where the accused could show harm of constitutional magnitude if such communication was not disclosed. In practice, this relatively high standard of release is not intended to invite a fishing expedition for possible statements made by the victim, nor is it intended to be an exception that effectively renders the privilege meaningless. If a military judge finds that an exception to this privilege applies, special care should be taken to narrowly tailor the release of privileged communications to only those statements which are relevant and whose probative value outweighs unfair prejudice.  The fact that otherwise privileged communications are admissible pursuant to an exception of Rule 514 does not prohibit a military judge from imposing reasonable limitations on cross-examination.  _See Delaware v. Van Arsdall_, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986); _United States v. Gaddis_, 70 M.J. 248, 256 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. Ellerbrock_, 70 M.J. 314 (C.A.A.F. 2011).  _See also_ Rule 611.

 _2013 Amendment._ Like the psychotherapist-patient privilege created by Mil. R. Evid. 513, Mil. R. Evid. 514 establishes a victim advocate-victim privilege for investigations or proceedings authorized under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Implemented as another approach to improving the military's overall effectiveness in addressing the crime of sexual assault, facilitating candor between victims and victim advocates, and mitigating the impact of the court-martial process on victims, the rule was developed in response to concerns raised by members of Congress, community groups and the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services (DTFSAMS). In its 2009 report, DTFSAMS noted that: 35 states had a privilege for communications between victim advocates and victims of sexual assault; victims did not believe they could communicate confidentially with medical and psychological support services provided by DoD; there was interference with the victim-victim advocate relationship and continuing victim advocate services when the victim advocate was identified as a potential witness in a court-martial; and service members reported being "re-victimized" when their prior statements to victim advocates were used to cross-examine them in court-martial proceedings. _Report of the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services_, at 69 (Dec. 2009).  DTFSAMS recommended that Congress "enact a comprehensive military justice privilege for communications between a Victim Advocate and a victim of sexual assault."  _Id._ at ES-4. The committee chose to model a proposed Mil. R. Evid. 514 on Mil. R. Evid. 513, including its various exceptions, in an effort to balance the privacy of the victim's communications with a victim advocate against the accused's legitimate needs.

 Under subsection (a) of Mil. R. Evid. 514, the words "under the Uniform Code of Military Justice" mean that the privilege only applies to misconduct situations constituting a case that could result in UCMJ proceedings. It does not apply in situations in which the offender is not subject to UCMJ jurisdiction. There is no intent to apply Mil. R. Evid. 514 in any proceeding other than those authorized under the UCMJ. However, service regulations dictate how the privilege is applied to non-UCMJ proceedings. Furthermore, this rule only applies to communications between a victim advocate and the victim of a sexual or violent offense.

 Under subsection (b), the committee intended the definition of "victim advocate" to include, but not be limited to, personnel performing victim advocate duties within the DoD Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (such as a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator), and the DoD Family Advocacy Program (such as a domestic abuse victim advocate). To determine whether an official's duties encompass victim advocate responsibilities, DoD and military service regulations should be consulted. A victim liaison appointed pursuant to the Victim and Witness Assistance Program is not a "victim advocate" for purposes of this rule, nor are personnel working within an Equal Opportunity or Inspector General office. For purposes of this rule, the committee intended "violent offense" to mean an actual or attempted murder, manslaughter, rape, sexual assault, aggravated assault, robbery, assault consummated by a battery, or similar offense. A simple assault may be a violent offense where the violence has been physically attempted or menaced. A mere threatening in words is not a violent offense. The committee recognizes that this rule will apply in situations where there is a factual dispute as to whether a sexual or violent offense occurred and whether a person actually suffered direct physical or emotional harm from such an offense. The fact that such findings have not been judicially established shall not prevent application of this rule to alleged victims reasonably intended to be covered by this rule.

 Under subsection (d), the exceptions to Mil. R. Evid. 514 are similar to the exceptions found in Mil. R. Evid. 513, and are intended to be applied in the same manner. Mil. R. Evid. 514 does not include comparable exceptions found within Mil. R. Evid. 513(d)(2) and 513(d)(7). In drafting the "constitutionally required" exception, the committee intended that communication covered by the privilege would be released only in the narrow circumstances where the accused could show harm of constitutional magnitude if such communication was not disclosed  . In practice, this relatively high standard of release is not intended to invite a fishing expedition for possible statements made by the victim, nor is it intended to be an exception that effectively renders the privilege meaningless. If a military judge finds that an exception to this privilege applies, special care should be taken to narrowly tailor the release of privileged communications to only those statements that are relevant and whose probative value outweighs unfair prejudice. The fact that otherwise privileged communications are admissible pursuant to an exception of Mil. R. Evid. 514 does not prohibit a military judge from imposing reasonable limitations on cross-examination. _See Delaware v. Van Arsdall_, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986); _United States v. Gaddis_, 70 M.J. 248, 256-57 (C.A.A.F. 2011); United States v. Ellerbrock, 70 M.J. 314, 318 (C.A.A.F. 2011).

 _2015 Amendment_: Rule 514(e)(2) was revised in accordance with _L.R.M. v. Kastenberg_, 72 M.J. 364 (C.A.A.F. 2013) ), and Section 534(c) of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291, 19 December 2014. Rule 514 was also revised to protect communications made to the Department of Defense Safe Helpline, which is a crisis support service for victims of sexual assault in the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense Safe Helpline was established in 2011 under a contract with the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. Rule 514(e) was amended to adopt a legal threshold that must be satisfied before a military judge may order an in camera review of records or communications falling within the privilege. While not required by Section 537 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, the Rule 514 threshold was modeled after the Rule 513 threshold required by that Section.

# WITNESSES

## Rule 601. Competency to testify in general.

Rule 601 is taken without change from the first portion of Federal

 Rule of Evidence 601. The remainder of the Federal Rule was deleted due to

its sole application to civil cases. 

 In declaring that subject

to any other Rule, all persons are competent to be witnesses, Rule 601 supersedes

Para. 148 of the 1969 Manual which required, among other factors, that an

individual know the difference between truth and falsehood and understand

the moral importance of telling the truth in order to testify. Under Rule

601 such matters will go only to the weight of the testimony and not to its

competency. The Rule's reference to other rules includes Rules 603 (Oath

or Affirmation), 605 (Competency of Military Judge as Witness), 606 (Competency

of Court Member as Witness), and the rules of privilege. 

 The

plain meaning of the Rule appears to deprive the trial judge of any discretion

whatsoever to exclude testimony on grounds of competency unless the testimony

is incompetent under those specific rules already cited _supra; see,

_ _United States v. Fowler_, 605 F.2d 181 (5th Cir.

1979), a conclusion bolstered by the Federal Rules of Evidence Advisory Committee's

 Note, S. Saltzburg & K. Redden, FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL 270

(2d ed. 1977). Whether this conclusion is accurate, especially in the light

of Rule 403, is unclear. _Id._ at 269; _see also United

States v. Calahan_, 442 F.Supp. 1213 (D. Minn. 1978).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 602. Need for personal knowledge.

Rule 602 is taken without significant change from the Federal Rule

 and is similar in content to Para. 138 _d_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 Although the 1969 Manual expressly allowed an individual to testify to his

or her own age or date of birth, the Rule is silent of the issue. 

 Notwithstanding

that silence, however, it appears that it is within the meaning of the Rule

to allow such testimony. Rule 804(b)(4) (Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable-Statement

of Personal or Family History) expressly permits a hearsay statement "concerning

the declarant's own birth . . . or other similar fact of personal or family

history, even though declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge

of the matter stated." It seems evident that if such a hearsay statement

is admissible, in-court testimony by the declarant should be no less admissible.

 It is probable that the expression "personal knowledge" in Rule

 804(b)(4) is being used in the sense of "first hand knowledge"

 while the expression is being used in Rule 602 in a somewhat broader sense

to include those matters which an individual could be considered to reliably

know about his or her personal history.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 603. Oath or affirmation to testify truthfully.

Rule 603 is taken from the Federal Rule without change. The oaths

 found within Chapter XXII of the Manual satisfy the requirements of Rule

603. Pursuant to Rule 1101(c), this Rule is inapplicable to the accused when

he or she makes an unsworn statement.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 604. Interpreter.

Rule 604 is taken from the Federal Rule without change and is consistent

with Para. 141, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The oath found in Paras. 114 _e

_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.) (now R.C.M. 807(b)(2) (Discussion), MCM, 1984),

satisfies the oath requirements of Rule 604.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended amending this rule to match the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the word "qualified" is undefined both in these rules and in the Federal Rules. R.C.M. 502(e)(1) states that the Secretary concerned may prescribe qualifications for interpreters. Practitioners should therefore refer to the Secretary's guidance to determine if an interpreter is qualified under this rule. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 605. Military judge's competency as a witness.

Rule 605(a) restates the Federal Rule without significant change.

 Although Article 26(d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice states in

 relevant part that "no person is eligible to act as a military judge

if he is a witness for the prosecution ..." and is silent on whether

a witness for the defense is eligible to sit, the Committee believes that

the specific reference in the code was not intended to create a right and

was the result only of an attempt to highlight the more grievous case. In

any event, Rule 605, unlike Article 26(d), does not deal with the question

of eligibility to sit as a military judge, but deals solely with the military

judge's competency as a witness. The rule does not affect _voir dire.

_ 

 Rule 605(b) is new and is not found within the Federal

Rules of Evidence. It was added because of the unique nature of the military

judiciary in which military judges often control their own dockets without

clerical assistance. In view of the military's stringent speedy trial roles, _

 see,_ _United States v. Burton_, 21 U.S.C.M.A 112,

44 C.M.R. 166 (1971), it was necessary to preclude expressly any interpretation

of Rule 605 that would prohibit the military judge from placing on the record

details relating to docketing in order to avoid prejudice to a party. Rule

605(b) is consistent with present military law.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising subsection (a) for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 606. Member's competency as a witness.

### (a) At the court-martial.

Rule 606(a) is taken from the Federal Rule without substantive

change. The Rule alters prior military law only to the extent that a member

of the court could testify as a defense witness under prior precedent. Rule

606(a) deals only with the competency of court members as witnesses and does

not affect other Manual provisions governing the eligibility of the individuals

to sit as members due to their potential status as witnesses.

_See_, _e.g.,_ Paras. 62 _f_ and 63, MCM,

1969 (Rev.). The Rule does not affect _voir dire._ 

### (b) Inquiry into validity of findings or sentence.

Rule 606(b) is taken from the Federal Rule with only one significant

 change. The rule, retitled to reflect the sentencing function of members,

 recognizes unlawful command influence as a legitimate subject of inquiry

and permits testimony by a member on that subject. The addition is required

by the need to keep proceedings free from any taint of unlawful command influence

and further implements Article 37(a) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Use of superior rank or grade by one member of a court to sway other members

would constitute unlawful command influence for purposes of this Rule under

Para. 74 _d_(1), MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Rule 606 does not itself

prevent otherwise lawful polling of members of the court, _see generally,

United States v. Hendon_, 6 M.J. 171, 174 (C.M.A. 1979), and does

not prohibit attempted lawful clarification of an ambiguous or inconsistent

verdict. Rule 606(b) is in general accord with prior military law.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended adding subsection (b) to this rule to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 607. Who may impeach a witness.

Rule 607 is taken without significant change from the Federal Rule.

 It supersedes Para. 153 _b_(1), MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which restricted

impeachment of one's own witness to those situations in which the witness

is indispensable or the testimony of the witness proves to be unexpectedly

adverse. 

 Rule 607 thus allows a party to impeach its own witness.

Indeed, when relevant, it permits a party to call a witness for the sole

purpose of impeachment. It should be noted, however, that an apparent inconsistency

exists when Rule 607 is compared with Rules 608(b) and 609(a). Although Rule

607 allows impeachment on direct examination, Rules 608(b) and 609(a) would

by their explicit language restrict the methods of impeachment to cross-examination.

The use of the expression "cross-examination" in these rules

appears to be accidental and to have been intended to be synonymous with

impeachment while on direct examination. _See generally_

S. Saltzburg & K. Redden, FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL 298-99

(2d ed. 1977). It is the intent of the Committee that the Rules be so interpreted

 unless the Article III courts should interpret the Rules in a different

fashion.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 608. A witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.

### (a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character.

Rule 608(a) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule. The Rule, which

 is consistent with the philosophy behind Rule 404(a), limits use of character

 evidence in the form of opinion or reputation evidence on the issue of credibility

by restricting such evidence to matters relating to the character for truthfulness

or untruthfulness of the witness. General good character is not admissible

under the Rule. Rule 608(a) prohibits presenting evidence of good character

until the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked. The

Rule is similar to Para. 153 _b_ of the 1969 Manual except

that the Rule, unlike Para. 153 _b_, applies to all witnesses

and does not distinguish between the accused and other witnesses. 

### (b) Specific instances of conduct.

Rule 608(b) is taken from the Federal Rule without significant

change. The Rule is somewhat similar in effect to the military practice found

 in Para. 153 _b_(2) of the 1969 Manual in that it allows use

of specific instances of conduct of a witness to be brought out on cross-examination

but prohibits use of extrinsic evidence. Unlike Para. 153 _b_(2),

Rule 608(b) does not distinguish between an accused and other witnesses. 

 The

fact that the accused is subject to impeachment by prior acts of misconduct

is a significant factor to be considered by the military judge when he or

she is determining whether to exercise the discretion granted by the Rule.

Although the Rule expressly limits this form of impeachment to inquiry on

 cross-examination, it is likely that the intent of the Federal Rule was to

 permit inquiry on direct as well, _see_ Rule 607, and the

use of the term "cross-examination" was an accidental substitute

for "impeachment." _See_ S. Saltzburg & K.

Redden, FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL 312-13 (2d ed. 1977). It is

the intent of the Committee to allow use of this form of evidence on direct

examination to the same extent, if any, it is so permitted in the Article

III courts. 

 The Rule does not prohibit receipt of extrinsic evidence

in the form of prior convictions, Rule 609, or to show bias. Rule 608(c). _

See also_ Rule 613 (Prior statements of witnesses). When the witness

has testified as to the character of another witness, the witness may be

 cross-examined as to the character of that witness. The remainder of Rule

 608(b) indicates that testimony relating only to credibility does not waive

the privilege against self-incrimination. _See generally_ Rule

301. 

 Although 608(b) allows examination into specific acts, counsel

 should not, as a matter of ethics, attempt to elicit evidence of misconduct

 unless there is a reasonable basis for the question. _See generally

_ ABA PROJECT ON STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE, STANDARDS RELATING

TO THE PROSECUTION FUNCTION AND THE DEFENSE FUNCTION, Prosecution Function

5.7(d); Defense Functions 7.6(d) (Approved draft 1971). 

### (c) Evidence of bias.

Rule 608(c) is taken from 1969 Manual Para. 153_d_ and

 is not found within the Federal Rule. Impeachment by bias was apparently

 accidentally omitted from the Federal Rule, _see_ S. Saltzburg

 & K. Redden, FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL 313-14 (2d ed. 1977),

 but is acceptable under the Federal Rules; _see,_ _

e.g.,_ _United States v. Leja_, 568 F.2d 493 (6th Cir.

1977); _ United States v. Alvarez-Lopez_, 559 F.2d 1155 (9th

Cir. 1977). Because of the critical nature of this form of impeachment and

the fact that extrinsic evidence may be used to show it, the Committee believed

that its omission would be impracticable. 

 It should be noted

that the Federal Rules are not exhaustive, and that a number of different

types of techniques of impeachment are not explicitly codified. 

 The

failure to so codify them does not mean that they are no longer permissible. _

See_, _e.g.,_ _United states v. Alvarez-Lopez

, supra_ 155; Rule 412. Thus, impeachment by contradiction, _

see also_ Rule 304(a)(2); 311(j), and impeachment via prior inconsistent

statements, Rule 613, remain appropriate. To the extent that the Military

Rules do not acknowledge a particular form of impeachment, it is the intent

of the Committee to allow that method to the same extent it is permissible

in the Article III courts. _ See_, _e.g.,_ Rules

402; 403. 

 Impeachment of an alleged victim of a sexual offense

through evidence of the victim's past sexual history and character is dealt

with in Rule 412, and evidence of fresh complaint is admissible to the extent

permitted by Rules 801 and 803.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 609. Impeachment by evidence of a criminal conviction.

### (a) General Rules.

Rule 609(a) is taken from the Federal Rule but has been slightly

 modified to adopt it to military law. For example, an offense for which a

 dishonorable discharge may be adjudged may be used for impeachment. This

 continues the rule as found in Para. 153 _b_(2)(b)(1) of the

 1969 Manual. In determining whether a military offense may be used for purposes

 of impeachment under Rule 609(a)(1), recourse must be made to the maximum

 punishment imposable if the offense had been tried by general court-martial. 

 Rule

609(a) differs slightly from the prior military rule. Under Rule 609(a)(1),

a civilian conviction's availability for impeachment is solely a function

of its maximum punishment under "the law in which the witness was convicted."

This is different from Para. 153 _b_(2)(b)(3) of the 1969

Manual which allowed use of a non-federal conviction analogous to a federal

felony or characterized by the jurisdiction as a felony or "as an offense

of comparable gravity." Under the new rule, comparisons and determinations

of relative gravity will be unnecessary and improper. 

 Convictions

that "involve moral turpitude or otherwise affect . . . credibility"

were admissible for impeachment under Para. 153 _b_(2)(b)

of the 1969 Manual. The list of potential convictions expressed in Para.

153 _b_(2)(b) was illustrative only and non-exhaustive. Unlike

the 1969 Manual rule, Rule 609(a) is exhaustive. 

 Although a conviction

technically fits within Rule 609(a)(1), its admissibility remains subject

to finding by the military judge that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial

effect to the accused. 

 Rule 609(a)(2) makes admissible convictions

involving "dishonesty or false statement, regardless of punishment."

This is similar to intent in Para. 153_b_(2)(b)(4) of the

1969 Manual which makes admissible "a conviction of any offense involving

fraud, deceit, larceny, wrongful appropriation, or the making of false statement."

The exact meaning of "dishonesty" within the meaning of Rule

609 is unclear and has already been the subject of substantial litigation.

The Congressional intent appears, however, to have been extremely restrictive

with "dishonesty" being used in the sense of untruthfulness. _

See generally_ S. Saltzburg & K. Redden, FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE

MANUAL 336-45 (2d ed. 1977). Thus, a conviction for fraud, perjury,

or embezzlement would come within the definition, but a conviction for simple

larceny would not. Pending further case development in the Article III courts,

caution would suggest close adherence to this highly limited definition. 

 It

should be noted that admissibility of evidence within the  scope of Rule

609(a)(2) is not explicitly subject to the discretion of the military judge.

The application of Rule 403 is unclear. 

 While the language of

Rule 609(a) refers only to cross-examination, it would appear that the Rule

does refer to direct examination as well. _See_ the Analysis

to Rules 607 and 608(b). 

 As defined in Rule 609(f), a court-martial

conviction occurs when a sentence has been adjudged. 

 _

1993 Amendment._ The amendment to Mil. R. Evid. 609(a) is based on

the 1990 amendment to Fed. R. Evid. 609(a). The previous version of Mil.

R. Evid. 609(a) was based on the now superseded version of the Federal Rule.

This amendment removes from the rule the limitation that the conviction may

only be elicited during cross-examination. Additionally, the amendment clarifies

the relationship between Rules 403 and 609. The amendment clarifies that

the special balancing test found in Mil. R. Evid. 609(a)(1) applies to the

accused's convictions. The convictions of all other witnesses are only subject

to the Mil. R. Evid. 403 balancing test. _See Green v. Bock Laundry

Machine Co.,_ 490 U.S. 504 (1989).

 _2012 Amendment:_ Rule 609(a) was amended to conform to the Federal Rule by replacing the word "credibility" with the words "character for truthfulness."  Rule 609(a)(2) was amended to conform to the Federal Rule.

### (b) Time limit.

Rule 609(b) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule. As it has

already been made applicable to the armed forces, _United States v.

 Weaver_, 1 M.J. 111 (C.M.A. 1975), it is consistent with the present

 military practice. 

### (c) Effect of pardon, annulment, or certificate of rehabilitation.

Rule 609(c) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule except that

 convictions punishable by dishonorable discharge have been added. Rule 609(c)

 has no equivalent in present military practice and represents a substantial

 change as it will prohibit use of convictions due to evidence of rehabilitation.

In the absence of a certificate of rehabilitation, the extent to which the

various Armed Forces post-conviction programs, such as the Air Force's 3320th

Correction and Rehabilitation Squadron and the Army's Retraining Brigade,

come within Rule 609(c) is unclear, although it is probable that successful

completion of such a program is "an equivalent procedure based on the

finding of the rehabilitation of the persons convicted" within the

meaning of the Rule.

 _2012 Amendment:_ Rule 609(c) was amended to conform to the Federal Rule.

### (d) Juvenile adjudications.

Rule 609(d) is taken from the Federal Rule without significant

change. The general prohibition in the Rule is substantially different from

 Para. 153_b_(2)(b) of the 1969 Manual which allowed use of

 juvenile adjudications other than those involving an accused. The discretionary

 authority vested in the military judge to admit such evidence comports with

the accused's constitutional right to a fair trial. _Davis v. Alaska,

_ 415 U.S. 308 (1974). 

### (e) Pendency of appeal.

The first portion of Rule 609(e) is taken from the Federal Rule

and is substantially different from Para. 153 _b_(2)(b) of

the 1969 Manual which prohibited use of convictions for impeachment purposes

while they were undergoing appellate review. Under the Rule, the fact of

review may be shown but does not affect admissibility. A different rule applies,

however, for convictions by summary court-martial or by special court-martial

without a military judge. The Committee believed that because a legally trained

presiding officer is not required in these proceedings, a conviction should

not be used for impeachment until review has been completed. 

 _

February 1986 Amendment:_ The reference in subsection (e) to "Article

65(c)" was changed to "Article 64" to correct an error

in MCM, 1984. 

### (f) Definition.

This definition of conviction has been added because of the unique

 nature of the court-martial. Because of its recognition that a conviction

 cannot result until at least sentencing, _cf. Frederic Lederer, Reappraising

the Legality of Post-trial Interviews,_ 1977 Army Law. 1, 12, the Rule may modify _ United States v.

Mathews,_ 6 M.J. 357 (C.M.A. 1979).

 _2011 Amendment._ Executive Order 13593 of December 13, 2011, amended this rule to  conform the rule with the Federal Rules of Evidence.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 610. Religious beliefs or opinions

Rule 610 is taken without significant change from the Federal Rules

 and had no equivalent in the 1969 Manual for Courts-Martial. The Rule makes

 religious beliefs or opinions inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching

or bolstering credibility. To the extent that such opinions may be critical

to the defense of a case, however, there may be constitutional justification

for overcoming the Rule's exclusion. _Cf._

_Davis v. Alaska_, 415 U.S. 308 (1974).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 611. Mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence.

### (a) Control by the military judge.

Rule 611(a) is taken from the Federal Rule without change. It is

a basic source of the military judge's power to control proceedings and replaces

 1969 Manual Para. 149 _a_ and that part of Para. 137 dealing

 with cumulative evidence. It is within the military judge's discretion to

 control methods of interrogation of witnesses. The Rule does not change prior

 law. Although a witness may be required to limit an answer to the question

 asked, it will normally be improper to require that a "yes" or

 "no" answer be given unless it is clear that such an answer will

be a complete response to the question. A witness will ordinarily be entitled

to explain his or her testimony at some time before completing this testimony.

The Manual requirement that questions be asked through the military judge

is now found in Rule 614. 

 Although the military judge has the

discretion to alter the sequence of proof to the extent that the burden of

proof is not affected, the usual sequence for examination of witnesses is:

prosecution witnesses, defense witnesses, prosecution rebuttal witnesses,

defense rebuttal witnesses, and witnesses for the court. The usual order

of examination of a witness is: direct examination, cross-examination, redirect

examination, recross-examination, and examination by the court. Para. 54 _

a_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _1995 Amendment:_ When

a child witness is unable to testify due to intimidation by the proceedings,

fear of the accused, emotional trauma, or mental or other infirmity, alternative

to live in-court testimony may be appropriate.

_See Maryland v. Craig_, 497 U.S. 836 (1990); _United States v. Romey_,

32 M.J. 180 (C.M.A.), _ cert. denied_, 502 U.S. 924 (1991); _

United States v. Batten_, 31 M.J. 205 (C.M.A. 1990); _United

States v. Thompson_, 31 M.J. 168 (C.M.A. 1990), _cert. denied

_, 111 S. Ct. 956 (1991). This is an evolving area of law

with guidance available in case law. The drafters, after specifically considering

adoption of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3509, determined it more appropriate to allow

the case law evolutionary process to continue. 

### (b) Scope of cross-examination.

Rule 611(b) is taken from the Federal Rule without change and replaces

Para. 149 _b_(1) of the 1969 Manual which was similar in scope.

Under the Rule the military judge may allow a party to adopt a witness and

proceed as if on direct examination. _See_ Rule 301(b)(2)

(judicial advice as to the privilege against self-incrimination for an apparently

uninformed witness); Rule 301(f)(2) (effect of claiming the privilege against

self-incrimination on cross-examination); Rule 303 (Degrading Questions);

and Rule 608(b) (Evidence of Character, Conduct, and Bias of Witness). 

### (c) Leading questions.

Rule 611(c) is taken from the Federal Rule without significant change

 and is similar to Para. 149 _c_ of the 1969 Manual. The reference

in the third sentence of the Federal Rule to an "adverse party"

has been deleted as being applicable to civil cases only. 

 A leading

question is one which suggests the answer it is desired that the witness

give. Generally, a question that is susceptible to being answered by "yes"

or "no" is a leading question. 

 The use of leading

questions is discretionary with the military judge. Use of leading questions

may be appropriate with respect to the following witnesses, among others:

children, persons with mental or physical disabilities, the extremely elderly,

hostile witnesses, and witnesses identified with the adverse party. 

 It

is also appropriate with the military judge's consent to utilize leading

questions to direct a witness's attention to a relevant area of inquiry. 

 _

1999 Amendment:_ Rule 611(d) is new. This amendment to Rule 611 gives

substantive guidance to military judges regarding the use of alternative

examination methods for child victims and witnesses in light of the U.S.

Supreme Court's decision in _Maryland v. Craig_, 497 U.S.

836 (1990) and the change in Federal law in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3509. Although _

Maryland v. Craig_ dealt with child witnesses who were themselves

the victims of abuse, it should be noted that 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3509, as

construed by Federal courts, has been applied to allow non-victim child witnesses

to testify remotely. _See, e.g._, _United States v.

Moses_, 137 F.3d 894 (6th Cir. 1998) (applying &sect; 3509 to a

non-victim child witness, but reversing a child sexual assault conviction

 on other grounds) and _ United States v. Quintero_, 21 F.3d

885 (9th Cir. 1994) (affirming conviction based on remote testimony of non-victim

 child witness, but remanding for resentencing). This amendment recognizes

that child witnesses may be particularly traumatized, even if they are not

 themselves the direct victims, in cases involving the abuse of other children

 or domestic violence. This amendment also gives the accused an election to

 absent himself from the courtroom to prevent remote testimony. Such a provision

 gives the accused a greater role in determining how this issue will be resolved.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended amending subsection (d)(3) to conform with the United States Supreme Court's holding in _Maryland v. Craig_, 497 U.S. 836 (1990), and CAAF's holding in _United States v. Pack_, 65 M.J. 381 (C.A.A.F. 2007). In Craig, the Supreme Court held that, in order for a child witness to be permitted to testify via closed-circuit one-way video, three factors must be met: (1) the trial court must determine that it "is necessary to protect the welfare of the particular child witness"; (2) the trial court must find "that the child witness would be traumatized, not by the courtroom generally, but by the presence of the defendant"; and (3) the trial court must find "that the emotional distress suffered by the child witness in the presence of the defendant is more than _de minimis_." Craig, 497 U.S. at 855-56. In Pack, CAAF held that, despite the Supreme Court's decision in _Crawford v. Washington_, the Supreme Court did not implicitly overrule _Craig_ and that all three factors must be present in order to permit a child witness to testify remotely. Pack, 65 M.J. at 384-85. This rule as previously written contradicted these cases because it stated that any one of four factors, rather than all three of those identified in _Craig_, would be sufficient to allow a child to testify remotely. The committee recommended the changes to ensure that this subsection aligned with the relevant case law.

 The language for subsection (5) was taken from 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3509(b)(1)(C), which covers child victims' and child witnesses' rights. There is no comparable Federal Rule of Evidence but the committee believes that a military judge may find that an Article 39(a) session outside the presence of the accused is necessary to make a decision regarding remote testimony. The committee intended to limit the number of people present at the Article 39(a) session in order to make the child feel more at ease, which is why the committee recommended including the language limiting those present to "a representative" of the defense and prosecution, rather than multiple representatives.

 The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 612. Writing used to refresh a witness's memory.

Rule 612 is taken generally from the Federal Rule but a number of

 modifications have been made to adapt the Rule to military practice. Language

 in the Federal Rule relating to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3500, which

 would have shielded material from disclosure to the defense under Rule 612

was discarded. Such shielding was considered to be inappropriate in view

of the general military practice and policy which utilizes and encourages

broad discovery on behalf of the defense. 

 The decision of the

president of a special court-martial without a military judge under this

rule is an interlocutory ruling not subject to objection by the members,

Para. 57 _a_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 Rule 612 codifies

the doctrine of past recollection refreshed and replaces that portion of

Para. 146_a_ of the 1969 Manual which dealt with the issue.

Although the 1969 Manual rule was similar, in that it authorized inspection

by the opposing party of a memorandum used to refresh recollection and permitted

it to be offered into evidence by that party to show the improbability of

it refreshing recollection, the Rule is somewhat more extensive as it also

deals with writings used before testifying. 

 Rule 612 does not

affect in any way information required to be disclosed under any other rule

or portion of the Manual. _See_, Rule 304(c)(1).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising subsection (b) of this rule to align with the Federal Rules of Evidence. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 613. Witness's prior statement.

### (a) Examining witness concerning prior statement.

Rule 613(a) is taken from the Federal Rule without change. It alters

 military practice inasmuch as it eliminates the foundation requirements found

 in Para. 153_b_(2)(c) of the 1969 Manual. While it will no

 longer be a condition precedent to admissibility to acquaint a witness with

the prior statement and to give the witness an opportunity to either change

his or her testimony or to reaffirm it, such a procedure may be appropriate

as a matter of trial tactics. 

 It appears that the drafters of

Federal Rule 613 may have inadvertently omitted the word "inconsistent"

from both its caption and the text of Rule 613(a). The effect of that omission,

if any, is unclear. 

### (b) Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement of witness.

Rule 613(b) is taken from the Federal Rule without change. It requires

that the witness be given an opportunity to explain or deny a prior inconsistent

statement when the party proffers extrinsic evidence of the statement. Although

this foundation is not required under Rule 613(a), it is required under Rule

613(b) if a party wishes to utilize more than the witness' own testimony

as brought out on cross-examination. The Rule does not specify any particular

timing for the opportunity for the witness to explain or deny the statement

nor does it specify any particular method. The Rule is inapplicable to introduction

of prior inconsistent statements on the merits under Rule 801.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 614. Court-martial's calling or examining a witness.

### (a) Calling by the court-martial.

The first sentence of Rule 614(a) is taken from the Federal Rule

but has been modified to recognize the power of the court members to call

and examine witnesses. The second sentence of the subdivision is new and

reflects the members' power to call or recall witnesses. Although recognizing

that power, the Rule makes it clear that the calling of such witnesses is

contingent upon compliance with these Rules and this Manual. Consequently,

the testimony of such witnesses must be relevant and not barred by any Rule

or Manual provision. 

### (b) Interrogation by the court-martial.

The first sentence of Rule 614(b) is taken from the Federal Rule

but modified to reflect the power under these Rules and Manual of the court-members

 to interrogate witnesses. The second sentence of the subdivision is new and

 modifies Para. 54_a_ and Para. 149_a_ of the

 present manual by requiring that questions of members be submitted to the

 military judge in writing. This change in current practice was made in order

to improve efficiency and to prevent prejudice to either party. Although

the Rule states that its intent is to ensure that the questions will "be

in a form acceptable to the military judge," it is not the intent of

the Committee to grant _carte blanche_ to the military judge in this matter.

It is the Committee's intent that the president will utilize the same procedure.

### (c) Objections.

Rule 614(c) is taken from the Federal Rule but modified to reflect

 the powers of the members to call and interrogate witnesses. This provision

 generally restates prior law but recognizes counsel's right to request an

 Article 39(a) session to enter an objection.

 _2013 Amendment._ In subsection (a), the committee recommended substituting the word "relevant" for "appropriate" because relevance is the most accurate threshold for admissibility throughout these rules. Additionally, the committee recommended adding the phrase "Following the opportunity for review by both parties" to subsection (b) to align it with the standard military practice to allow the counsel for both sides to review a question posed by the members, and to voice objections before the military judge rules on the propriety of the question. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 

## Rule 615. Excluding witnesses.

Rule 615 is taken from the Federal Rule with only minor changes

of terminology. The first portion of the Rule is in conformity with prior

 practice, _e.g.,_ Para. 53_f_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 The second portion, consisting of subdivisions (2) and (3), represents a

 substantial departure from prior practice and will authorize the prosecution

to designate another individual to sit with the trial counsel. Rule 615 thus

 modifies Para. 53 _f_. Under the Rule, the military judge

lacks any discretion to exclude potential witnesses who come within the scope

of Rule 615(2) and (3) unless the accused's constitutional right to a fair

trial would be violated. Developing Article III practice recognizes the defense

right, upon request, to have a prosecution witness, not excluded because

of Rule 615, testify before other prosecution witnesses. 

 Rule

615 does not prohibit exclusion of either accused or counsel due to misbehavior

when such exclusion is not prohibited by the Constitution of the United States,

the Uniform Code of Military Justice, this Manual, or these Rules. 

 _

2002 Amendment:_ These changes are intended to extend to victims

at courts-martial the same rights granted to victims by the Victims' Rights

and Restitution Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 10606(b)(4),

giving crime victims "[t]he right to be present at all public court proceedings

related to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by the

victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at

trial," and the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997, 18

U.S.C. &sect; 3510, which is restated in subsection (5). For the purposes of this

rule, the term "victim" includes all persons defined as victims

in 42 U.S.C. &sect; 10607(e)(2), which means "a person that has suffered

direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission

of a crime, including"-(A) in the case of a victim that is an

institutional entity, an authorized representative of the entity; and (B)

 in the case of a victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated,

or deceased, one of the following (in order of preference): (i) a spouse;

(ii) a legal guardian; (iii) a parent; (iv) a child; (v) a sibling; (vi)

another family member; or (vii) another person designated by the court. The

victim's right to remain in the courtroom remains subject to other rules,

 such as those regarding classified information, witness deportment, and conduct

 in the courtroom. Subsection (4) is intended to capture only those statutes

 applicable to courts-martial.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 _2015 Amendment_: Rule 615(e) was revised to implement Section 1701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013.

 

# OPINIONS AND EXPERT TESTIMONY

## Rule 701. Opinion testimony by lay witnesses

Rule 701 is taken from the Federal Rule without change and supersedes

 that portion of Para. 138 _e_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which dealt

 with opinion evidence by lay witnesses. Unlike the prior Manual rule which

 prohibited lay opinion testimony except when the opinion was of a "kind

 which is commonly drawn and which cannot, or ordinarily cannot, be conveyed

to the court by a mere recitation of the observed facts," the Rule

permits opinions or inferences whenever rationally based on the perception

of the witness and helpful to either a clear understanding of the testimony

or the determination of a fact in issue. Consequently, the Rule is broader

in scope than the Manual provision it replaces. The specific examples listed

in the Manual, "the speed of an automobile, whether a voice heard was

that of a man, woman or child, and whether or not a person was drunk"

are all within the potential scope of Rule 701. 

_ 2004

Amendment:_ Rule 701 was modified based on the amendment to Fed. R. Evid.

701, effective 1 December 2000, and is taken from the Federal Rule without

change. It prevents parties from proffering an expert as a lay witness in

an attempt to evade the gatekeeper and reliability requirements of Rule 702

by providing that testimony cannot qualify under Rule 701 if it is based on

"scientific, technical, or other special knowledge within the scope of Rule

702."

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 702. Testimony by expert witnesses.

Rule 702 is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim, and replaces that

 portion of Para. 138 _e_, MCM, 1969 (Rev.), dealing with expert

 testimony. Although the Rule is similar to the prior Manual rule, it may

be broader and _may_ supersede _Frye v. United States

_, 293 F.1013 (C.D. Cir. 1923), an issue now being extensively litigated

in the Article III courts. The Rule's sole explicit test is whether the evidence

in question "will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence

or to determine a fact in issue." Whether any particular piece of evidence

comes within the test is normally a matter within the military judge's discretion. 

 Under

Rule 103(a) any objection to an expert on the basis that the individual is

not in fact adequately qualified under the Rule will be waived by a failure

to so object. 

 Para. 142_ e_ of the 1969 Manual,

"Polygraph tests and drug-induced or hypnosis-induced interviews,"

has been deleted as a result of the adoption of Rule 702. Para. 142_

 e_ states, "The conclusions based upon or graphically represented

by a polygraph test and conclusions based upon, and the statements of the

person interviewed made during a drug-induced or hypnosis-induced interview

are inadmissible in evidence." The deletion of the explicit prohibition

on such evidence is not intended to make such evidence _per se_ admissible,

and is not an express authorization for such procedures. Clearly, such evidence

must be approached with great care. Considerations surrounding the nature

of such evidence, any possible prejudicial effect on a fact finder, and the

degree of acceptance of such evidence in the Article III courts are factors

to consider in determining whether it can in fact "assist the trier

of fact." As of late 1979, the Committee was unaware of any significant

decision by a United States Court of Appeals sustaining the admissibility

of polygraph evidence in a criminal case, _see e.g., United States

v. Masri_, 547 F.2d 932 (5th Cir. 1977); _United States v.

Cardarella_, 570 F.2d 264 (8th Cir. 1978), although the Seventh Circuit, _

see e.g.,_ _United States v. Bursten_, 560 F.2d 779

(7th Cir. 1977) (holding that polygraph admissibility is within the sound

discretion of the trial judge) and perhaps the Ninth Circuit, _United

States v. Benveniste_, 564 F.2d 335, 339 n.3 (9th Cir. 1977), at

least recognize the possible admissibility of such evidence. There is reason

to believe that evidence obtained via hypnosis may be treated somewhat more

liberally than is polygraph evidence. _See_, _e.g.,

_ _Kline v. Ford Motor Co.,_ 523 F.2d 1067 (9th Cir.

1975). 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ Rule 702 was modified

based on the amendment to Fed. R. Evid. 702, effective 1 December 2000, and

is taken from the Federal Rule without change. It provides guidance for courts

and parties as to the factors to consider in determining whether an expert's

testimony is reliable in light of _Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,

Inc.,_ 509 U.S. 579 (1993), and _Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,

_ 526 U.S. 137 (1999) (holding that gatekeeper function applies to

all expert testimony, not just testimony based on science).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 703. Bases of an expert's opinion testimony.

Rule 703 is taken from the Federal Rule without change. The Rule

is similar in scope to Para. 138 _e_ of the 1969 Manual, but

is potentially broader as it allows reliance upon "facts or data"

 whereas the 1969 Manual's limitation was phrased in terms of the personal

 observation, personal examination or study, or examination or study "of

 reports of others of a kind customarily considered in the practice of the

 expert's specialty." Hypothetical questions of the expert are not

required by the Rule. 

 A limiting instruction may be appropriate

if the expert while expressing the basis for an opinion states facts or data

that are not themselves admissible. _See_ Rule 105. 

 Whether

Rule 703 has modified or superseded the_ Frye_ test for scientific

evidence, _Frye v. United States_, 293 F.1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923),

is unclear and is now being litigated within the Article III courts. 

_

 2004 Amendment:_ Rule 703 was modified based on the amendment

to Fed. R. Evid. 703, effective 1 December 2000, and is virtually identical

to its Federal Rule counterpart. It limits the disclosure to the members

of inadmissible information that is used as the basis of an expert's opinion.

 _Compare_ Mil. R. Evid. 705.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule to align with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 

## Rule 704. Opinion on ultimate issue

Rule 704 is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim. The 1969 Manual

for Courts-Martial was silent on the issue. The Rule does not permit the

witness to testify as to his or her opinion as to the guilt or innocence

of the accused or to state legal opinions. Rather it simply allows testimony

involving an issue which must be decided by the trier of fact. Although the

two may be closely related, they are distinct as a matter of law. 

 _

February 1986 Amendment:_ Fed. R. Evid. 704(b), by operation of Mil.

R. Evid. 1102, became effective in the military as Mil. R. Evid. 704(b) on

10 April 1985. The Joint-Service Committee on Military Justice considers

Fed. R. Evid. 704(b) an integral part of the Insanity Defense Reform Act,

ch. IV, Pub.L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2067-68 (1984), (hereafter

 the Act). Because proposed legislation to implement these provisions of the

Act relating to insanity as an affirmative defense had not yet been enacted

in the UCMJ by the date of this Executive Order, the Committee recommended

that the President rescind the application of Fed. R. Evid. 704(b) to the

military. Even though in effect since 10 April 1985, this change was never

published in the Manual. 

 _1986 Amendment:_ While

writing the Manual provisions to implement the enactment of Article 50a,

UCMJ ("Military Justice Amendments of 1986," National Defense

Authorization Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub.L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat.

3905 (1986)), the drafters rejected adoption of Fed. R. Evid. 704(b). The statutory

qualifications for military court members reduce the risk that military court

members will be unduly influenced by the presentation of ultimate opinion

testimony from psychiatric experts.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 705. Disclosing the facts or data underlying an expert's opinion.

Rule 705 is taken from the Federal Rule without change and is similar

 in result to the requirement in Para. 138 _e_ of the 1969

Manual that the "expert may be required, on direct or cross-examination,

to specify the data upon which his opinion was based and to relate the details

of his observation, examination, or study." Unlike the 1969 Manual,

Rule 705 requires disclosure on direct examination only when the military

judge so requires.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 706. Court-appointed expert witnesses.

### (a) Appointment and compensation.

Rule 706(a) is the result of a complete redraft of subdivision (a)

of the Federal Rule that was required to be consistent with Article 46 of

the Uniform Code of Military Justice which was implemented in Paras. 115

and 116, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Rule 706(a) states the basic rule that prosecution,

defense, military judge, and the court members all have equal opportunity

under Article 46 to obtain expert witnesses. The second sentence of the subdivision

replaces subdivision (b) of the Federal Rule which is inapplicable to the

armed forces in light of Para. 116, MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### (b) Disclosure of employment.

Rule 706(b) is taken from Fed. R. Evid. 706(c) without change. The

1969 Manual was silent on the issue, but the subdivision should not change

military practice. 

### (c) Accused's expert of own selection.

Rule 706(c) is similar in intent to subdivision (d) of the Federal

 Rule and adapts that Rule to military practice. The subdivision makes it

clear that the defense may call its own expert witnesses at its own expense

without the necessity of recourse to Para. 116.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended removing former subsection (b) because the committee believes that the authority of the military judge to tell members that he or she has called an expert witness is implicit in his or her authority to obtain the expert, and therefore the language was unnecessary. Although the language has been removed, the committee intends that the military judge may, in the exercise of discretion, notify the members that he or she called the expert. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 707. Polygraph Examinations

Rule 707 is new and is similar to Cal. Evid. Code 351.1 (West 1988

 Supp.). The Rule prohibits the use of polygraph evidence in courts-martial

and is based on several policy grounds. There is a real danger that court

members will be misled by polygraph evidence that "is likely to be

shrouded with an aura of near infallibility." _United States

v. Alexander_, 526 F.2d 161, 168-69 (8th Cir. 1975). To the extent

that the members accept polygraph evidence as unimpeachable or conclusive,

despite cautionary instructions from the military judge, the members "traditional

 responsibility to collectively ascertain the facts and adjudge guilt or

innocence is preempted." _Id._ There is also a danger

of confusion of the issues, especially when conflicting polygraph evidence

diverts the members' attention from a determination of guilt or innocence

to a judgment of the validity and limitations of polygraphs. This could result

in the court-martial degenerating into a trial of the polygraph machine. _

State v. Grier_, 300 S.E.2d 351 (N.C. 1983). Polygraph evidence also

can result in a substantial waste of time when the collateral issues regarding

the reliability of the particular test and qualifications of the specific

polygraph examiner must be litigated in every case. Polygraph evidence places

a burden on the administration of justice that outweighs the probative value

of the evidence. The reliability of polygraph evidence has not been sufficiently

established and its use at trial impinges upon the integrity of the judicial

system. _ See_ _People v. Kegler_, 242 Cal.

Rptr. 897 (Cal. Ct. App. 1987). Thus, this amendment adopts a bright-line

rule that polygraph evidence is not admissible by any party to a court-martial

even if stipulated to by the parties. This amendment is not intended to accept

or reject _United States v. Gipson_, 24 M.J. 343 (C.M.A. 1987),

concerning the standard for admissibility of other scientific evidence under

Mil. R. Evid. 702 or the continued vitality of _Frye v. United States

_, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923). Finally, subsection (b) of the rule

ensures that any statements which are otherwise admissible are not rendered

inadmissible solely because the statements were made during a polygraph examination.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

# HEARSAY

## Rule 801. Definitions that apply to this section; exclusions from hearsay.

### (a) Statement.

Rule 801(a) is taken from the Federal Rule without change and is

 similar to Para. 139 _a_ of the 1969 Manual. 

### (b) Declarant.

Rule 801(b) is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim and is the same

 definition used in prior military practice. 

### (c) Hearsay.

Rule 801(c) is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim. It is similar

to the 1969 Manual definition, found in Para. 139_ a_, which

 stated: "A statement which is offered in evidence to prove the truth

of the matters stated therein, but which was not made by the author when

a witness before the court at a hearing in which it is so offered, is hearsay."

 Although the two definitions are basically identical, they actually differ

 sharply as a result of the Rule's exceptions which are discussed _

 infra._ 

### (d) Statements which are not hearsay.

Rule 801(d) is taken from the Federal Rule without change and removes

 certain categories of evidence from the definition of hearsay. In all cases,

 those categories represent hearsay within the meaning of the 1969 Manual

 definition. 

#### (1) Prior statement by witness.

Rule 801(d)(1) is taken from the Federal Rule without change and

 removes certain prior statements by the witness from the definition of hearsay.

 Under the 1969 Manual rule, an out-of-court statement not within an exception

 to the hearsay rule and unadopted by the testifying witness, is inadmissible

 hearsay notwithstanding the fact that the declarant is now on the stand and

 able to be cross-examined, Para. 139_a_;_ United States

 v. Burge_, 1 M.J. 408 (C.M.A. 1976) (Cook, J., concurring). The

justification for the 1969 Manual rule is presumably the traditional view

that out-of-court statements cannot be adequately tested by cross-examination

 because of the time differential between the making of the statement and

the giving of the in-court testimony. The Federal Rules of Evidence Advisory

 Committee rejected this view in part believing both that later cross-examination

is sufficient to ensure reliability and that earlier statements are usually

preferable to later ones because of the possibility of memory loss. _

See generally,_ 4 J. Weinstein & M. Berger, WEINSTEIN'S EVIDENCE

Para. 801(d)(1)(01) (1978). Rule 801(d)(1) thus not only makes an important

shift in the military theory of hearsay, but also makes an important change

in law by making admissible a number of types of statements that were either

inadmissible or likely to be inadmissible under prior military law. 

 Rule

801(d)(1)(A) makes admissible on the merits a statement inconsistent with

the in-court testimony of the witness when the prior statement "was

given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or

other proceeding, or in a deposition." The Rule does not require that

the witness have been subject to cross-examination at the earlier proceeding,

but requires that the witness must have been under oath and subject to penalty

of perjury. Although the definition of "trial, hearing, or other proceeding"

is uncertain, it is apparent that the Rule was intended to include grand

jury testimony and may be extremely broad in scope. _See United States v. Castro-Ayon_, 537 F.2d 1055 (9th Cir.), _

cert. denied,_ 429 U.S. 983 (1976) (tape recorded statements given

under oath at a Border Patrol station found to be within the Rule). It should

clearly apply to Article 32 hearings. The Rule does not require as a prerequisite

a statement "given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury."

The mere fact that a statement was given under oath may not be sufficient.

No foundation other than that indicated as a condition precedent in the Rule

is apparently necessary to admit the statement under the Rule. _But

see_ WEINSTEIN'S EVIDENCE 801-74 (1978).

 Rule 801(d)(1)(B) makes admissible as substantive evidence on the merits a statement consistent with the in-court testimony of the witness and "offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive."  Unlike Rule 801(d)(1)(A), the earlier consistent statement need not have been made under oath or at any type of proceeding.  On its face, the Rule does not require that the consistent statement offered have been made prior to the time the improper influence or motive arose or prior to the alleged recent fabrication.  Notwithstanding this, the Supreme Court has read such a requirement into the rule.  _Tome v. United States_, 513 U.S. 150 (1995); _see also United States v. Allison_, 49 M.J. 54 (C.A.A.F. 1998).  The limitation does not, however, prevent admission of a consistent statement made after an inconsistent statement but  before the  improper influence or motive  arose.  _United  States v. Scholle_, 553 F.2d 1109 (8th  Cir. 1977). Rule 801(d)(1)(B) provides a possible means to admit evidence of fresh complaint in prosecution of sexual offenses.  Although limited to circumstances in which there is a charge, for example, of recent fabrication, the Rule, when applicable, would permit not only fact of fresh complaint, as is presently possible, but also the entire portion of the consistent statement.

 Under Rule 801(d)(1)(C) a statement of identification

is not hearsay. The content of the statement as well as the fact of identification

is admissible. The Rule must be read in conjunction with Rule 321 which governs

 the admissibility of statements of pretrial identification. 

#### (2) Admission by party opponent.

Rule 801(d)(2) eliminates a number of categories of statements from

 the scope of the hearsay rule.

Unlike those statements within the purview of Rule 801(d)(1), statements within the purview of Rule 801(d)(2) would have come within the exceptions to the hearsay rule as recognized in the 1969 Manual.

Consequently, their

 "reclassification" is a matter of academic interest only. No

 practical differences result. The reclassification results from a belief

that the adversary system impels admissibility and that reliability is not

a significant factor. 

 Rule 801(d)(2)(A) makes admissible against

a party a statement made in either the party's individual or representative

capacity. This was treated as an admission or confession under Para. 140 _

a_ of the 1969 Manual, and is an exception of the prior hearsay rule. 

 Rule

801(d)(2)(B) makes admissible "a statement of which the party has manifested

the party's adoption or belief in its truth." This is an adoptive admission

and was an exception to the prior hearsay rule. _Cf._ Para.

140 _a_(4) of the 1969 Manual. While silence may be treated

as an admission on the facts of a given case, _ see_ Rule

304(h)(3) and the analysis thereto, under Rule 801(d)(2) that silence must

have been intended by the declarant to have been an assertion. Otherwise,

the statement will not be hearsay within the meaning of Rule 801(d)(2) and

will presumably be admissible, if at all, as circumstantial evidence. 

 Rule

801(d)(2)(C) makes admissible "a statement by a person authorized by

the party to make a statement concerning the subject." While this was

not expressly dealt with by the 1969 Manual, it would be admissible under

prior law as an admission; _Cf._ Para. 140_ b_,

utilizing agency theory. 

 Rule 801(d)(2)(D) makes admissible "a

statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the

scope of the agency or employment of the agent or servant, made during the

existence of the relationship." These statements would appear to be

admissible under prior law. Statements made by interpreters, as by an individual

serving as a translator for a service member in a foreign nation who is,

for example, attempting to consummate a drug transaction with a non-English

speaking person, should be admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(D) or Rule 801(d)(2)(C). 

 Rule

801(d)(2)(E) makes admissible "a statement by a co-conspirator of a

party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy." This

is similar to the military hearsay exception found in Para. 140 _

b_ of the 1969 Manual. Whether a conspiracy existed for purposes

of this Rule is solely a matter for the military judge. Although this is

the prevailing Article III rule, it is also the consequence of the Military

Rules' modification to Federal Rule of Evidence 104(b). Rule 801(d)(2)(E)

does not address many critical procedural matters associated with the use

of co-conspirator evidence. _See generally_ Comment, Restructuring

the Independent Evidence Requirement of the Coconspirator Hearsay Exception,

127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1439 (1979). For example, the burden of proof placed on the

proponent is unclear although a preponderance appears to be the developing

Article III trend. Similarly, there is substantial confusion surrounding

the question of whether statements of an alleged co-conspirator may themselves

be considered by the military judge when determining whether the declarant

was in fact a co-conspirator. This process, known as bootstrapping, was not

permitted under prior military law. _See_, _e.g.,_ _

United States v. Duffy_, 49 C.M.R. 208, 210 (A.F.C.M.R. 1974); _

United States v. LaBossiere_, 13 C.M.A. 337, 339, 32 C.M.R. 337,

339 (1962). A number of circuits have suggested that Rule 104(a) allows the

use of such statements, but at least two circuits have held that other factors

prohibit bootstrapping. _United States v. James_, 590 F.2d

575 (5th Cir.) (en banc), _cert. denied_, 442 U.S. 917 (1979); _

United States v. Valencia_, 609 F.2d 603 (2d Cir. 1979). Until such

time as the Article III practice is settled, discretion would dictate that

prior military law be followed and that bootstrapping not be allowed. Other

procedural factors may also prove troublesome although not to the same extent

as bootstrapping. For example, it appears to be appropriate for the military

judge to determine the co-conspirator question in a preliminary Article 39(a)

session. Although receipt of evidence "subject to later connection"

or proof is legally possible, the probability of serious error, likely requiring

a mistrial, is apparent. 

 Rule 801(d)(2)(E) does not appear to

change what may be termed the "substantive law" relating to statements

made by co-conspirators. Thus, whether a statement was made by a co-conspirator

in furtherance of a conspiracy is a question for the military judge, and

a statement made by an individual after he or she was withdrawn from a conspiracy

is not made "in furtherance of the conspiracy." 

 Official

statements made by an officer-as by the commanding officer of a battalion,

squadron, or ship, or by a staff officer, in an endorsement of other communication-are

not excepted from the operation of the hearsay rule merely by reason of the

official character of the communication or the rank or position of the officer

making it. 

 The following examples of admissibility under this

Rule may be helpful: 

##### (1) A is being tried for assaulting B.

The defense presents the testimony of C that just before the assault

 C heard B say to A that B was about to kill A with B's knife. The testimony

of C is not hearsay, for it is offered to show that A acted in self-defense

 because B made the statement and not to prove the truth of B's statement.

##### (2) A is being tried for rape of B.

If B testifies at trial, the testimony of B that she had previously

 identified A as her attacker at an identification lineup would be admissible

 under Rule 801(d)(1)(C) to prove that it was A who raped B. 

##### (3) Private A is being tried for disobedience of a certain order given

him orally by Lieutenant B.

C is able to testify that he heard Lieutenant B give the order to

A. This testimony, including testimony of C as to the terms of the order,

would not be hearsay. 

##### (4) The accused is being tried for the larceny of clothes from a locker.

A is able to testify that B told A that B saw the accused leave

the quarters in which the locker was located with a bundle resembling clothes

about the same time the clothes were stolen. This testimony from A would

not be admissible to prove that facts stated by B. 

##### (5) The accused is being tried for wrongfully selling government clothing.

A policeman is able to testify that while on duty he saw the accused

 go into a shop with a bundle under his arm; that he entered the shop and

the accused ran away; that he was unable to catch the accused; and that thereafter

 the policeman asked the proprietor of the shop what the accused was doing

 there; and that the proprietor replied that the accused sold him some uniforms

 for which he paid the accused $30. Testimony by the policeman as to the reply

 of the proprietor would be hearsay if it was offered to prove the facts stated

 by the proprietor. The fact that the policeman was acting in the line of

duty at the time the proprietor made the statement would not render the evidence

 admissible to prove the truth of the statement. 

##### (6) A defense witness in an assault case testifies on direct examination

 that the accused did not strike the alleged victim.

On cross-examination by the prosecution, the witness admits that

at a preliminary investigation he stated that the accused had struck the

alleged victim. The testimony of the witness as to this statement will be

admissible if he was under oath at the time and subject to a prosecution

for perjury.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended changing the title of subsection (d)(2) from "Admission by party-opponent" to "An Opposing Party's Statement" to conform to the Federal Rules of Evidence. The term "admission" is misleading because a statement falling under this exception need not be an admission and also need not be against the party's interest when spoken. In making this change, the committee did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 802. The rule against hearsay.

Rule 802 is taken generally from the Federal Rule but has been

modified to recognize the application of any applicable Act of Congress. 

 Although

the basic rule of inadmissibility for hearsay is identical with that found

in Para. 139_a_ of the 1969 Manual, there is a substantial

change in military practice as a result of Rule 103(a). Under the 1969 Manual,

hearsay was incompetent evidence and did not require an objection to be inadmissible.

Under the new Rules, however, admission of hearsay will not be error unless

there is an objection to the hearsay. _ See_ Rule 103(a).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 803. Exceptions to the rule against hearsay - regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness.

Rule 803 is taken generally from the Federal Rule with modifications

as needed for adaptation to military practice. Overall, the Rule is similar

to practice under Manual Paras. 142 and 144 of the 1969 Manual. The Rule

is, however, substantially more detailed and broader in scope than the 1969

Manual. 

### (1) Present sense impression.

Rule 803(1) is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim. The exception

it establishes was not recognized in the 1969 Manual for Courts-Martial.

It is somewhat similar to a spontaneous exclamation, but does not require

a startling event. A fresh complaint by a victim of a sexual offense may

come within this exception depending upon the circumstances. 

### (2) Excited utterance.

Rule 803(2) is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim. Although similar

 to Para. 142 _b_ of the 1969 Manual with respect to spontaneous

 exclamations, the Rule would appear to be more lenient as it does not seem

to require independent evidence that the startling event occurred. An examination

 of the Federal Rules of Evidence Advisory Committee Note indicates some

uncertainty, however. S. Saltzburg & K. Redden, FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE

 MANUAL 540 (2d ed. 1977). A fresh complaint of a sexual offense may come

within this exception depending on the circumstances. 

### (3) Then existing mental, emotional, or physical condition.

Rule 803(3) is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim. The Rule is

 similar to that found in 1969 Manual Para. 142d but may be slightly more

 limited in that it may not permit statements by an individual to be offered

to disclose the intent of another person. Fresh complaint by a victim of

a sexual offense may come within this exception. 

### (4) Statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.

Rule 803(4) is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim. It is substantially

broader than the state of mind or body exception found in Para. 142 _

d_ of the 1969 Manual. It allows, among other matters, statements

as to the cause of the medical problem presented for diagnosis or treatment.

Potentially, the Rule is extremely broad and will permit statements made

even to non-medical personnel (_e.g._, members of one's family)

and on behalf of others so long as the statements are made for the purpose

of diagnosis or treatment. The basis for the exception is the presumption

that an individual seeking relief from a medical problem has incentive to

make accurate statements. _See generally_, 4 J. Weinstein

& M. Berger, WEINSTEIN'S EVIDENCE Para. 804(4)(01) (1978). The admissibility

under this exception of those portions of a statement not relevant to diagnosis

or treatment is uncertain. Although statements made to a physician, for example,

merely to enable the physician to testify, do not appear to come within the

Rule, statements solicited in good faith by others in order to ensure the

health of the declarant would appear to come within the Rule. Rule 803(4)

may be used in an appropriate case to present evidence of fresh complaint

in a sexual case. 

### (5) Recorded recollection.

Rule 803(5) is taken from the Federal Rule without change, and is

 similar to the present exception for past recollection recorded found in

Paras. 146 _a_ and 149 _c_(1)(b) of the 1969

Manual except that under the Rule the memorandum may be read but not presented

to the fact finder unless offered by the adverse party. 

### (6) Record of regularly conducted activity.

Rule 803(6) is taken generally from the Federal Rule. Two modifications

have been made, however, to adapt the rule to military practice. The definition

of "business" has been expanded to explicitly include the armed

forces to ensure the continued application of this hearsay exception, and

a descriptive list of documents, taken generally from 1969 Manual Para. 144 _

d_, has been included. Although the activities of the armed forces

do not constitute a profit making business, they do constitute a business

within the meaning of the hearsay exception, _ see_ Para. 144 _

c_, of the 1969 Manual, as well as a "regularly conducted activity." 

 The

specific types of records included within the Rule are those which are normally

records of regularly conducted activity within the armed forces. They are

included because of their importance and because their omission from the

Rule would be impracticable. The fact that a record is of a type described

within subdivision does not eliminate the need for its proponent to show

that the_ particular_ record comes within the Rule when the

record is challenged; the Rule does establish that the _ types_ of

records listed are normally business records. 

 Chain of custody

receipts or documents have been included to emphasize their administrative

nature. Such documents perform the critical function of accounting for property

obtained by the United States Government. Although they may be used as prosecution

evidence, their primary purpose is simply one of property accountability.

In view of the primary administrative purpose of these matters, it was necessary

to provide expressly for their admissibility as an exception to the hearsay

rule in order to clearly reject the interpretation of Para. 144 _

d_ of the 1969 Manual with respect to chain of custody forms as set

forth in _United States v. Porter_, 7 M.J. 32 (C.M.A. 1979)

and _United States v. Nault_, 4 M.J. 318 (C.M.A. 1978) insofar

as they concerned chain of custody forms. 

 Laboratory reports

have been included in recognition of the function of forensic laboratories

as impartial examining centers. The report is simply a record of "regularly

conducted" activity of the laboratory. _See, e.g., United States

v. Strangstalien_, 7 M.J. 225 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States

v. Evans_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 579, 45 C.M.R. 353 (1972). 

 Paragraph

144 _d_ prevented a record "made principally with a

view to prosecution, or other disciplinary or legal action . . .rdquo;

from being admitted as a business record. The limitation has been deleted, _

but see_ Rule 803(8)(B) and its Analysis. It should be noted that

a record of "regularly conducted activity" is unlikely to have

a prosecutorial intent in any event. 

 The fact that a record may

fit within another exception,_ e.g._, Rule 803(8), does not

generally prevent it from being admissible under this subdivision although

it would appear that the exclusion found in Rule 803(8)(B) for "matters

observed by police officers and other personnel acting in a law enforcement

capacity" prevent any such record from being admissible as a record

of regularly conducted activity. Otherwise the limitation in subdivision

(8) would serve no useful purpose. _See also_ Analysis to

Rule 803(8)(B). 

 Rule 803(6) is generally similar to the 1969 Manual

rule but is potentially broader because of its use of the expression "regularly

 conducted" activity in addition to "business." It also

 permits records of opinion which were prohibited by Para. 144 _d_

of the 1969 Manual. Offsetting these factors is the fact that the Rule requires

that the memorandum was "made at or near the time by, or from information

transmitted by a person with knowledge . . .," but Para. 144 _

c_ of the 1969 Manual rule expressly did not require such knowledge

as a condition of admissibility. 

_ 2004 Amendment:_ Rule

803(6) was modified based on the amendment to Fed. R. Evid. 803(6), effective

1 December 2000. It permits a foundation for business records to be made

through certification to save the parties the expense and inconvenience of

producing live witnesses for what is often perfunctory testimony. The Rule

incorporates federal statutes that allow certification in a criminal proceeding

in a court of the United States. _See, e.g._, 18 U.S.C. &sect;

3505 (Foreign records of regularly conducted activity.) The Rule does not

include foreign records of regularly conducted business activity in civil

cases as provided in its Federal Rule counterpart. This Rule works together

with Mil. R. Evid. 902(11).

### (7) Absence of entry in records kept in accordance with the provisions

of paragraph (6).

Rule 803(7) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule. The Rule is

 similar to Paras. 143 _a_(2)(h) and 143 _b_(3)

of the 1969 Manual. 

### (8) Public records and reports.

Rule 803(8) has been taken generally from the Federal Rule but has

 been slightly modified to adapt it to the military environment. Rule 803(8)(B)

 has been redrafted to apply to "police officers and other personnel

 acting in a law enforcement capacity" rather the Federal Rule's "police

officers and other law enforcement personnel." The change was necessitated

by the fact that all military personnel may act in a disciplinary capacity.

Any officer, for example, regardless of assignment, may potentially act as

a military policeman. The capacity within which a member of the armed forces

acts may be critical. 

 The Federal Rule was also modified to include

a list of records that, when made pursuant to a duty required by law, will

be admissible notwithstanding the fact that they may have been made as "matters

 observed by police officers and other personnel acting in a law enforcement

 capacity." Their inclusion is a direct result of the fact, discussed

 above, that military personnel may all function within a law enforcement

 capacity. The Committee determined it would be impracticable and contrary

to the intent of the Rule to allow the admissibility of records which are

truly administrative in nature and unrelated to the problems inherent in

records prepared only for purposes of prosecution to depend upon whether

the maker was at that given instant acting in a law enforcement capacity.

The language involved is taken generally from Para. 144 _b_ of

the 1969 Manual. Admissibility depends upon whether the record is "a

record of a fact or event if made by a person within the scope of his official

duties and those duties included a duty to know or ascertain through appropriate

and trustworthy channels of information the truth of the fact or event . . ."

Whether any given record was obtained in such a trustworthy fashion is a

question for the military judge. The explicit limitation on admissibility

of records made "principally with a view to prosecution" found

in Para. 144 _d_ has been deleted. 

 The fact that

a document may be admissible under another exception to the hearsay rule, _

e.g._, Rule 803(6), does not make it inadmissible under this subdivision. 

 Military

Rule of Evidence 803(8) raises numerous significant questions. Rule 803(8)(A)

extends to "records, reports, statements, or data compilations"

of public offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of the office

or agency. The term "public office or agency" within this

subdivision is defined to include any government office or agency including

those of the armed forces. Within the civilian context, the definition of

"public offices or agencies" is fairly clear and the line of

demarcation between governmental and private action can be clearly drawn

in most cases. The same may not be true within the armed forces. It is unlikely

that every action taken by a servicemember is an "activity" of

the department of which he or she is a member. Presumably, Rule 803(8) should

be restricted to activities of formally sanctioned instrumentalities roughly

similar to civilian entities. For example, the activities of a squadron headquarters

or a staff section would come within the definition of "office or agency."

Pursuant to this rationale, there is no need to have a military regulation

or directive to make a statement of a "public office or agency"

under Rule 803(8)(A). However, such regulations or directives might well

be highly useful in establishing that a given administrative mechanism was

indeed an "office or agency" within the meaning of the Rule. 

 Rule

803(8)(B) encompasses "matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by

law as to which matters there was a duty to report. . .." This portion

of Rule 803(8) is broader than subdivision (8)(A) as it extends to far more

than just the normal procedures of an office or agency. Perhaps because of

this extent, it requires that there be a specific duty to observe and report.

This duty could take the form of a statement, general order, regulation,

or any competent order. 

 The exclusion in the Federal Rule for

"matters observed by police officers" was intended to prevent

use of the exception for evaluative reports as the House Committee believed

them to be unreliable. Because of the explicit language of the exclusion,

normal statutory construction leads to the conclusion that reports which

would be within Federal or Military Rule 803(8) but for the exclusion in

(8)(B) are not otherwise admissible under Rule 803(6). Otherwise the inclusion

of the limitation would serve virtually no purpose whatsoever. There is no

contradiction between the exclusion in Rule 803(8)(B) and the specific documents

made admissible in Rule 803(8) (and Rule 803(6)) because those documents

are not matters "observed by police officers and other personnel acting

in a law enforcement capacity." To the extent that they might be so

considered, the specific language included by the Committee is expressly

intended to reject the subdivision (8)(B) limitation. Note, however, that

all forms of evidence not within the specific item listing of the Rule but

within the (8)(B) exclusion will be admissible insofar as Rule 803(8) is

concerned, whether the evidence is military or civilian in origin. 

 A

question not answered by Rule 803(8) is the extent to which a regulation

or directive may circumscribe Rule 803(8). Thus, if a regulation establishes

a given format or procedure for a report which is not followed, is an otherwise

admissible piece of evidence inadmissible for lack of conformity with the

regulation or directive? The Committee did not address this issue in the

context of adopting the Rule. However, it would be at least logical to argue

that a record not made in substantial conformity with an implementing directive

is not sufficiently reliable to be admissible. _See_ Rule

403. Certainly, military case law predating the Military Rules may resolve

 this matter to the extent to which it is not based purely on now obsolete

 Manual provisions. As the modifications to subdivision (8) dealing with

specific records retains the present Manual language, it is particularly likely

 that present case law will survive in this area. 

 Rule 803(8)(C)

makes admissible, but only against the Government, "factual findings

resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law,

unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of

trustworthiness." This provision will make factual findings made, for

example, by an Article 32 Investigating Officer or by a Court of Inquiry

admissible on behalf of an accused. Because the provision applies only to

"factual findings," great care must be taken to distinguish such

factual determinations from opinions, recommendations, and incidental inferences.

### (9) Records of vital statistics.

Rule 803(9) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule and had no

express equivalent in the 1969 Manual. 

### (10) Absence of public record or entry.

Rule 803(10) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rules and is similar

 to 1969 Manual Para. 143 _a_(2)(g). 

### (11-13) Records of religious organizations: Marriage, baptismal, and similar

 certificates: Family records.

Rule 802(11)-(13) are all taken verbatim from the Federal

Rules and had no express equivalents in the 1969 Manual. 

### (14-16) Records of documents affecting an interest in property: Statements

in documents affecting an interest in property; Statements in ancient documents.

Rules 803(14)-(16) are taken verbatim from the Federal Rules

 and had no express equivalents in the 1969 Manual. Although intended primarily

 for civil cases, they all have potential importance to courts-martial. 

### (17) Market reports, commercial publications.

Rule 803(17) is taken generally from the Federal Rule. Government

 price lists have been added because of the degree of reliance placed upon

them in military life. Although included within the general Rule, the Committee

 believed it inappropriate and impracticable not to clarify the matter by

 specific reference. The Rule is similar in scope and effect to the 1969 Manual

 Para. 144 _f_ except that it lacks the Manual's specific

reference to an absence of entries. The effect, if any, of the difference

is unclear. 

### (18) Learned treatise.

Rule 803(18) is taken from the Federal Rule without change. Unlike

 Para. 138 _e_ of the 1969 Manual, which allowed use of such

 statements only for impeachment, this Rule allows substantive use on the

merits of statements within treaties if relied upon in direct testimony or

called to the expert's attention on cross-examination. Such statements may

not, however, be given to the fact finder as exhibits. 

### (19-20) Reputation concerning personal or family history; reputation concerning

 boundaries or general history.

Rules 803(19)-(20) are taken without change from the Federal

 Rules and had no express equivalents in the 1969 Manual. 

### (21) Reputation as to character.

Rule 803(21) is taken from the Federal Rule without change. It is

 similar to Para. 138 _f_ of the 1969 Manual in that it creates

 an exception to the hearsay rule for reputation evidence. "Reputation"

and "community" are defined in Rule 405(d), and "community"

includes a "military organization regardless of size." Affidavits

and other written statements are admissible to show character under Rule

405(c), and, when offered pursuant to that Rule, are an exception to the

hearsay rule. 

### (22) Judgment or previous conviction.

Rule 803(22) is taken from the Federal Rule but has been modified

to recognize convictions of a crime punishable by a dishonorable discharge,

a unique punishment not present in civilian life. _See also_ Rule

 609 and its Analysis. 

 There is no equivalent to this Rule in

military law. Although the Federal Rule is clearly applicable to criminal

cases, its original intent was to allow use of a prior criminal conviction

in a subsequent civil action. To the extent that it is used for criminal

cases, significant constitutional issues are raised, especially if the prior

conviction is a foreign one, a question almost certainly not anticipated

by the Federal Rules Advisory Committee. 

### (23) Judgment as to personal, family or general history, or boundaries.

Rule 803(23) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule, and had no

 express equivalent in the 1969 Manual. Although intended for civil cases,

it clearly has potential use in courts-martial for such matters as proof

of jurisdiction.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended removing subsection (24), which stated: "Other Exceptions: [Transferred to Mil. R. Evid. 807]" because practitioners are generally aware that Mil. R. Evid. 807 covers statements not specifically covered in this rule, and therefore the subsection was unnecessary. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 804. Exceptions to the rule against hearsay - when the declarant is unavailable as a witness.

### (a) Definition of unavailability.

Subdivisions (a)(1)-(a)(5) of Rule 804 are taken from the

 Federal Rule without change and are generally similar to the relevant portions

 of Paras. 145 _a_ and 145 _b_ of the 1969 Manual,

 except that Rule 804(a)(3) provides that a witness who "testifies as

to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant's statement"

is unavailable. The Rule also does not distinguish between capital and non-capital

 cases. 

 _February 1986 Amendment:_ The phrase "claim

 or lack of memory" was changed to "claim of lack of memory"

 to correct an error in MCM, 1984. 

 Rule 804(a)(6) is new and has

been added in recognition of certain problems, such as combat operations,

that are unique to the armed forces. Thus, Rule 804(a)(6) will make unavailable

a witness who is unable to appear and testify in person for reason of military

necessity within the meaning of Article 49(d)(2). The meaning of "military

necessity" must be determined by reference to the cases construing

Article 49. The expression is not intended to be a general escape clause,

but must be restricted to the limited circumstances that would permit use

of a deposition. 

### (b) Hearsay exceptions

#### (1) Former testimony.

The first portion of Rule 804(b)(1) is taken from the Federal Rule

 with omission of the language relating to civil cases. The second portion

is new and has been included to clarify the extent to which those military

 tribunals in which a verbatim record normally is not kept come within the

Rule. 

 The first portion of Rule 804(b)(1) makes admissible former

 testimony when "the party against whom the testimony is now offered

had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct,

cross, or redirect examination." Unlike Para. 145 _b_ of

the 1969 Manual, the Rule does not explicitly require that the accused, when

the evidence is offered against him or her, have been "afforded at

the former trial an opportunity, to be adequately represented by counsel."

Such a requirement should be read into the Rule's condition that the party

have had "opportunity and similar motive." In contrast to the

1969 Manual, the Rule does not distinguish between capital and non-capital

cases. 

 The second portion of Rule 804(b)(1) has been included

to ensure that testimony from military tribunals, many of which ordinarily

do not have verbatim records, will not be admissible unless such testimony

is presented in the form of a verbatim record. The Committee believed substantive

use of former testimony to be too important to be presented in the form of

an incomplete statement. 

 Investigations under Article 32 of the

Uniform Code of Military Justice present a special problem. Rule 804(b)(1)

requires that "the party against whom the testimony is now offered

had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony" at

the first hearing. The "similar motive" requirement was intended

primarily to ensure sufficient identity of issues between the two proceedings

and thus to ensure an adequate interest in examination of the witness. _

See, e.g._, J. Weinstein & M. Berger, WEINSTEIN'S EVIDENCE Para.

804(b)(1)((04)) (1978). Because Article 32 hearings represent a unique hybrid

of preliminary hearings and grand juries with features dissimilar to both,

it was particularly difficult for the Committee to determine exactly how

subdivision (b)(1) of the Federal Rule would apply to Article 32 hearings.

The specific difficulty stems from the fact that Article 32 hearings were

intended by Congress to function as discovery devices for the defense as

well as to recommend an appropriate disposition of charges to the convening

authority. _Hutson v. United States_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 437, 42

C.M.R. 39 (1970); _United States v. Samuels_, 10 U.S.C.M.A.

206, 212, 27 C.M.R. 280, 286 (1959). _See generally Hearing on H.R.

2498 Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services_, 81st

Cong., 1st Sess., 997 (1949). It is thus permissible, for example, for a

defense counsel to limit cross-examination of an adverse witness at an Article

32 hearing using the opportunity for discovery alone, for example, rather

than impeachment. In such a case, the defense would not have the requisite

"similar motive" found within Rule 804(b)(1). 

 Notwithstanding

the inherent difficulty of determining the defense counsel's motive at an

Article 32 hearing, the Rule is explicitly intended to prohibit use of testimony

given at an Article 32 hearing unless the requisite "similar motive"

was present during that hearing. It is clear that some Article 32 testimony

is admissible under the Rule notwithstanding the Congressionally sanctioned

discovery purpose of the Article 32 hearing. Consequently, one is left with

the question of the extent to which the Rule actually does apply to Article

32 testimony. The only apparent practical solution to what is otherwise an

irresolvable dilemma is to read the Rule as permitting only Article 32 testimony

preserved via a verbatim record that is not objected to as having been obtained

without the requisite "similar motive." While defense counsel's

assertion of his or her intent in not examining one or more witnesses or

in not fully examining a specific witness is not binding upon the military

judge, clearly the burden of establishing admissibility under the Rule is

on the prosecution and the burden so placed may be impossible to meet should

the defense counsel adequately raise the issue. As a matter of good trial

practice, a defense counsel who is limiting cross-examination at the Article

32 hearing because of discovery should announce that intent sometime during

the Article 32 hearing so that the announcement may provide early notice

to all concerned and hopefully avoid the necessity for counsel to testify

at the later trial. 

 The Federal Rule was modified by the Committee

to require that testimony offered under Rule 804(b)(1) which was originally

"given before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions,

other military tribunals, and before proceedings pursuant to or equivalent

to those required by Article 32" and which is otherwise admissible

under the Rule be offered in the form of a verbatim record. The modification

was intended to ensure accuracy in view of the fact that only summarized

or minimal records are required of some types of military proceedings. 

 An

Article 32 hearing is a "military tribunal." The Rule distinguishes

between Article 32 hearings and other military tribunals in order to recognize

that there are other proceedings which are considered the equivalent of Article

32 hearings for purposes of former testimony under Rule 804(b)(1). 

#### (2) Statement under belief of impending death.

Rule 804(b)(2) is taken from the Federal Rule except that the language,

"for any offense resulting in the death of the alleged victim,"

has been added and reference to civil proceedings has been omitted. The new

language has been added because there is no justification for limiting the

exception only to those cases in which a homicide charge has actually been

preferred. Due to the violent nature of military operations, it may be appropriate

to charge a lesser included offense rather than homicide. The same justifications

for the exception are applicable to lesser included offenses which are also,

of course, of lesser severity. The additional language, taken from Para.

142 _a_, thus retains the 1969 Manual rule, modification of

which was viewed as being impracticable. 

 Rule 804(b)(2) is similar

to the dying declaration exception found in Para. 142 _a_ of

the 1969 Manual, except that the Military Rule does not require that the

declarant be dead. So long as the declarant is unavailable and the offense

is one for homicide or other offense resulting in the death of the alleged

victim, the hearsay exception may be applicable. This could, for example,

result from a situation in which the accused, intending to shoot A, shoots

both A and B; uttering the hearsay statement, under a belief of impending

death, B dies, and although A recovers, A is unavailable to testify at trial.

In a trial of the accused for killing B, A's statement will be admissible. 

 There

is no requirement that death immediately follow the declaration, but the

declaration is not admissible under this exception if the declarant had a

hope of recovery. The declaration may be made by spoken words or intelligible

signs or may be in writing. It may be spontaneous or in response to solicitation,

including leading questions. The utmost care should be exercised in weighing

statements offered under this exception since they are often made under circumstances

 of mental and physical debility and are not subject to the usual tests of

 veracity. The military judge may exclude those declarations which are viewed

as being unreliable. _See_ Rule 403. 

 A dying

declaration and its maker may be contradicted and impeached in the same manner

as other testimony and witnesses. Under the prior law, the fact that the

deceased did not believe in a deity or in future rewards or punishments may

be offered to affect the weight of a declaration offered under this Rule

but does not defeat admissibility. Whether such evidence is now admissible

in the light of Rule 610 is unclear. 

#### (3) Statement against interest.

Rule 804(b) is taken from the Federal Rule without change, and has

no express equivalent in the 1969 Manual. It has, however, been made applicable

by case law, _United States v. Johnson_, 3 M.J. 143 (C.M.A.

1977). It makes admissible statements against a declarant's interest, whether

 pecuniary, proprietary, or penal when a reasonable person in the position

of the declarant would not have made the statement unless such a person would

have believed it to be true. 

 The Rule expressly recognizes the

penal interest exception and permits a statement tending to expose the declarant

to criminal liability. The penal interest exception is qualified, however,

when the declaration is offered to exculpate the accused by requiring the

"corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of

the statement." This requirement is applicable, for example, when a

third party confesses to the offense the accused is being tried for and the

accused offers the third party's statement in evidence to exculpate the accused.

The basic penal interest exception is established as a matter of constitutional

law by the Supreme Court's decision in _Chambers v. Mississippi_,

410 U.S. 284 (1973), which may be broader than the Rule as the case may not

require either corroborating evidence or an unavailable declarant. 

 In

its present form, the Rule fails to address a particularly vexing

problem-that of the declaration against penal interest which implicates the accused

as well as the declarant. On the face of the Rule, such a statement should

be admissible, subject to the effects, if any, of _ Bruton v. United

States_, 391 U.S. 123 (1968) and Rule 306. Notwithstanding this,

there is considerable doubt as to the applicability of the Rule to such a

situation. _See generally_ 4 J. Weinstein & M. Berger,

WEINSTEIN'S EVIDENCE 804-93, 804-16 (1978). Although the legislative

history reflects an early desire on the part of the Federal Rules of Evidence

Advisory Committee to prohibit such testimony, a provision doing so was not

included in the material reviewed by Congress. Although the House included

such a provision, it did so apparently in large part based upon a view that _

Bruton, supra_, prohibited such statements-arguably an erroneous

view of_ Bruton. See Bruton, supra_ at 128 n.3. _Dutton v. Evans_, 400 U.S. 74 (1970). The Conference Committee deleted

the House provision, following the Senate's desires, because it believed

it inappropriate to "codify constitutional evidentiary principles."

WEINSTEIN'S EVIDENCE at 804-16 (1978) citing CONG.REC.H 11931-32

(daily ed. Dec. 14, 1974). Thus, applicability of the hearsay exception to

individuals implicating the accused may well rest only on the extent to which _

Bruton, supra_, governs such statement. The Committee intends that

the Rule extend to such statements to the same extent that subdivision 804(b)(4)

is held by the Article III courts to apply to such statements. 

#### (4) Statement of personal or family history.

Rule 804(b)(4) of the Federal Rule is taken verbatim from the Federal

 Rule, and had no express equivalent in the 1969 Manual. The primary feature

of Rule 803(b)(4)(A) is its application even though the "declarant

had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated."

 _2013 Amendment._ In subsection (b)(3)(B), the committee intentionally recommended leaving undisturbed the phrase "and is offered to exculpate the accused," despite the fact that it is not included in the current or former versions of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Unlike its recommendation to remove subsection (24) in Mil. R. Evid. 803, the committee did not recommend removing subsection (5) of Mil. R. Evid. 804, which directs practitioners to the residual exception in Mil. R. Evid. 807, because doing so would cause the remaining subsections to be renumbered. Although subsection (5) is not necessary, renumbering the subsections within this rule would have a detrimental effect on legal research and also would lead to inconsistencies in numbering between these rules and the Federal Rules. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 805. Hearsay within hearsay

Rule 805 is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule. Although

the 1969 Manual did not exactly address the issue, the military rule is identical

 with the new rule.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 

## Rule 806. Attacking and supporting the declarant's credibility.

Rule 806 is taken from the Federal Rule without change. It

 restates the prior military rule that a hearsay declarant or statement may

 always be contradicted or impeached. The Rule eliminates any requirement

that the declarant be given "an opportunity to deny or explain"

an inconsistent statement or inconsistent conduct when such statement or

conduct is offered to attack the hearsay statement. As a result, Rule 806

supersedes Rule 613(b) which would require such an opportunity for a statement

 inconsistent with in-court testimony.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 807. Residual exception

Rule 807 was adopted on 30 May 1998 without change from the Federal Rule and represents the residual exception to the hearsay rule formerly contained in Mil. R. Evid. 803(24) and Mil. R. Evid. 804(b)(5).

 The Rule strikes a balance between the general policy behind the Rules of Evidence of permitting admission of probative and reliable evidence and the congressional intent "that the residual hearsay exceptions will be used very rarely, and only in exceptional circumstances." S. Rep. No. 93-1277, _reprinted_ in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7051, 7066.  Mil. R. Evid. 807 represents the acceptance of the so-called "catch-all" or "residual" exception to the hearsay rule.  Because of the constitutional concerns associated with hearsay statements, the courts have created specific foundational requirements in order for residual hearsay to be admitted.  _See United States v. Haner_, 49 M.J. 72, 77-78 (C.A.A.F. 1998).  These requirements are:  necessity, materiality, reliability, and notice.

 The necessity prong "essentially creates a 'best evidence' requirement."  _United States v. Kelley_, 45 M.J. 275, 280 (C.A.A.F. 1996) (quoting _Larez v. City of Los Angeles_, 946 F.2d 630, 644 (9th Cir. 1991)).  Coupled with the rule's materiality requirement, necessity represents an important fact that is more than marginal or inconsequential and is in furtherance of the interests of justice and the general purposes of the rules of evidence.

 There are two alternative tests in order to fulfill the reliability condition.  If the residual hearsay is a "non-testimonial statement," the proponent of the statement must demonstrate that the statement has particularized guarantees of trustworthiness as shown from the totality of the circumstances.  _Idaho v. Wright_, 497 U.S. 805 (1990).  The factors surrounding the taking of the statement and corroboration by other evidence should be examined to test the statement for trustworthiness.  The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has held that the Supreme Court's prohibition against bolstering the indicia of reliability under a Sixth Amendment analysis does not apply to a residual hearsay analysis.  Therefore, in addition to evidence of the circumstances surrounding the taking of the statement, extrinsic evidence can be considered.  _United States v. McGrath_, 39 M.J. 158, 167 (C.M.A. 1994).  However, if the residual hearsay is a "testimonial statement," e.g. "affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the [accused] was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially," the proponent of the statement must demonstrate that the declarant of the statement is unavailable and the accused had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant on the statement.  _Crawford v. Washington_, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

# AUTHENTICATION AND INDENTIFICATION

## Rule 901. Authenticating or identifying evidence.

### (a) General provision.

Rule 901(a) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule, and is similar

 to Para. 143 _b_ of the 1969 Manual, which stated in pertinent

 part that: "A writing may be authenticated by any competent proof that

it is genuine-is in fact what it purports or is claimed to be."

 Unlike the 1969 Manual provision, however, Rule 901(a) is not limited to

 writings and consequently is broader in scope. The Rule supports the requirement

for logical relevance. _See_ Rule 401. 

 There is

substantial question as to the proper interpretation of the Federal Rule

equivalent of Rule 901(a). The Rule requires only "evidence sufficient

to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims."

It is possible that this phrasing supersedes any formulaic approach to authentication

and that rigid rules such as those that have been devised to authenticate

taped recordings, for example, are no longer valid. On the other hand, it

appears fully appropriate for a trial judge to require such evidence as is

needed "to support a finding that the matter in question is what its

proponent claims," which evidence may echo in some cases the common

law formulations. There appears to be no reason to believe that the Rule

will change the present law as it affects chains of custody for real

evidence-especially if fungible. Present case law would appear to be consistent with

the new Rule because the chain of custody requirement has not been applied

in a rigid fashion. A chain of custody will still be required when it is

necessary to show that the evidence is what it is claimed to be and, when

appropriate, that its condition is unchanged. Rule 901(a) may make authentication

somewhat easier, but is unlikely to make a substantial change in most areas

of military practice. 

 As is generally the case, failure to object

to evidence on the grounds of lack of authentication will waive the objection. _

See_ Rule 103(a). 

### (b) Illustration.

Rule 901(b) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule with the exception

of a modification to Rule 901(b)(10). Rule 901(b)(10) has been modified by

the addition of "or by applicable regulations prescribed pursuant to

statutory authority." The new language was added because it was viewed

as impracticable in military practice to require statutory or Supreme Court

action to add authentication methods. The world wide disposition of the armed

forces with their frequent redeployments may require rapid adjustments in

authentication procedures to preclude substantial interference with personnel

practices needed to ensure operational efficiency. The new language does

not require new statutory authority. Rather, the present authority that exists

for the various Service and Departmental Secretaries to issue those regulations

necessary for the day to day operations of their department is sufficient. 

 Rule

901(b) is a non-exhaustive list of illustrative examples of authentication

techniques. None of the examples are inconsistent with prior military law

and many are found within the 1969 Manual, _see_, Para. 143 _

b_. Self-authentication is governed by Rule 902.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule to align with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 902. Evidence that is self-authenticating.

Rule 902 has been taken from the Federal Rule without significant

change except that a new subdivision, 4a, has been added and subdivisions

(4) and (10) have been modified. The Rule prescribes forms of self-authentication.

### (1) Domestic public documents under seal.

Rule 902(1) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule, and is similar

 to aspects of Paras. 143 _b_(2)(c) and (d) of the 1969 Manual.

 The Rule does not distinguish between original document and copies. A seal

is self-authenticating and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is

 presumed genuine. Judicial notice is not required. 

### (2) Domestic public documents not under seal.

Rule 902(2) is taken from the Federal Rule without change. It is

 similar in scope to aspects of Paras. 143 _b_(2)(c) and (d)

of the 1969 Manual in that it authorizes use of a certification under seal

to authenticate a public document not itself under seal. This provision is

not the only means of authenticating a domestic public record under this

Rule. _ Compare_ Rule 902(4); 902(4a). 

### (3) Foreign public documents.

Rule 902(3) is taken without change from the Federal Rule. Although

 the Rule is similar to Paras. 143 _b_(2)(e) and (f) of the

1969 Manual, the Rule is potentially narrower than the prior military one

as the Rule does not permit "final certification" to be made

by military personnel as did the Manual rule nor does it permit authentication

made by military personnel as did the Manual rule nor does it permit authentication

 made solely pursuant to the laws of the foreign nation. On the other hand,

the Rule expressly permits the military judge to order foreign documents

to "be treated as presumptively authentic without final certification

or permit them to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without final

 certification." 

### (4) Certified copies of public records.

Rule 902(4) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule except that

it has been modified by adding "or applicable regulations prescribed

 pursuant to statutory authority." The additional language is required

by military necessity and includes the now existing statutory powers of the

 President and various Secretaries to promulgate regulations. _See,

 generally_, Analysis to Rule 901(b). 

 Rule 902(4) expands

upon prior forms of self-authentication to acknowledge the propriety of certified

public records or reports and related materials domestic or foreign, the

certification of which complies with subdivisions (1), (2), or (3) of the

Rule. 

### (4a) Documents or records of the United States accompanied by attesting

 certificates.

This provision is new and is taken from the third rule.subparagraph

 of Para. 143 _b_(2)(c) of the 1969 Manual. It has been inserted

 due to the necessity to facilitate records of the United States in general

and military records in particular. Military records do not have seals and

it would not be practicable to either issue them or require submission of

documents to those officials with them. In many cases, such a requirement

would be impossible to comply with due to geographical isolation or the unwarranted

time such a requirement could demand. 

 An "attesting certificate"

is a certificate or statement, signed by the custodian of the record or the

deputy or assistant of the custodian, which in any form indicates that the

writing to which the certificate or statement refers is a true copy of the

record or an accurate "translation" of a machine, electronic,

or coded record, and the signer of the certificate or statement is acting

in an official capacity as the person having custody of the record or as

the deputy or assistant thereof. _See_ Para. 143 _

a_(2)(a) of the 1969 Manual. An attesting certificate does not require

further authentication and, absent proof to the contrary, the signature of

the custodian or deputy or assistant thereof on the certificate is presumed

to be genuine. 

### (5-9) Official publications; Newspapers and periodicals; Trade inscriptions

 and the like; Acknowledged documents; Commercial paper and related documents.

Rules 902(5)-(9) are taken verbatim from the Federal Rules

and have no equivalents in the 1969 Manual or in military law. 

### (10) Presumptions under Acts of Congress and Regulations.

Rule 902(10) was taken from the Federal Rule but was modified by

 adding "and Regulations" in the caption and "or by applicable

 regulation prescribed pursuant to statutory authority." _See

 generally_ the Analysis to Rule 901(b)(10) for the reasons for the

 additional language. The statutory authority referred to includes the presently

 existing authority for the President and various Secretaries to prescribe

 regulations. 

### (11) 2004 Amendment:

Rule 902(11) was modified based on the amendment to Fed. R. Evid.

902(11), effective 1 December 2000, and is taken from the Federal Rule without

change. It provides for self-authentication of domestic business records

and sets forth procedures for preparing a declaration of a custodian or other

qualified witness that will establish a sufficient foundation for the admissibility

of domestic business records. This Rule works together with Mil. R. Evid.

803(6).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended adding language to subsection (11) to permit the military judge to admit non-noticed documents even after the trial has commenced if the offering party shows good cause to do so. The committee also recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 903. Subscribing witness's testimony.

Rule 903 is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule and has no

 express equivalent in the 1969 Manual.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 

# CONTENTS OF WRITINGS, RECORDINGS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS

## Rule 1001. Definitions that apply to this section.

### (1) Writings and recordings.

Rule 1001(1) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule and is similar

 in scope to Para. 143 _d_ of the 1969 Manual. Although the

1969 Manual was somewhat more detailed, the Manual was clearly intended to

be expansive. The Rule adequately accomplishes the identical purpose through

a more general reference. 

### (2) Photographs.

Rule 1001(2) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule and had no

 express equivalent in the 1969 Manual. It does, however, reflect current

 military law. 

### (3) Original.

Rule 1001(3) is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule and is similar

 to Para. 143 _a_(1) of the 1969 Manual. The 1969 Manual,

however, treated "duplicate originals," _i.e._,

 carbon and photographic copies made for use as an original, as an "original"

while Rule 1001(4) treats such a document as a "duplicate."

### (4) Duplicate.

Rule 1004(4) is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim and includes

 those documents Para. 143 _a_(1) of the 1969 Manual defined

as "duplicate originals." In view of Rule 1003's rule of admissibility

 for "duplicate," no appreciable negative result stems from the

 reclassification.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule to align with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

 

## Rule 1002. Requirement of the original

Rule 1002 is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule except that

 "this Manual" has been added in recognition of the efficacy of

 other Manual provisions. The Rule is similar in scope to the best evidence

rule found in Para. 143 _a_(19) of the 1969 Manual except

that specific reference is made in the rule to recordings and photographs.

Unlike the 1969 Manual, the Rule does not contain the misleading reference

to "best evidence" and is plainly applicable to writings, recordings,

 or photographs. 

 It should be noted that the various exceptions

to Rule 1002 are similar to but not identical with those found in the 1969

Manual. _ Compare_ Rules 1005-1007 _with_ Para.

143_ a_(2)(f) of the 1969 Manual. For example, Paras. 143 _

a_ (2)(e) and 144 _c_ of the 1969 Manual excepted banking

records and business records from the rule as categories while the Rule does

not. The actual difference in practice, however, is not likely to be substantial

as Rule 1003 allows admission of duplicates unless, for example, "a

genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original."

This is similar in result to the treatment of business records in Para. 144 _

 a_ of the 1969 Manual. Omission of other 1969 Manual exceptions,

 _e.g._, certificates of fingerprint comparison and identity,

 _see_ Rule 703, 803, evidence of absence of official or business

 entries, and copies of telegrams and radiograms, do not appear substantial

when viewed against the entirety of the Military Rules which are likely to

allow admissibility in a number of ways. 

 The Rule's reference

to "Act of Congress" will now incorporate those statutes that

specifically direct that the best evidence rule be inapplicable in one form

or another. _See, e.g._, 1 U.S.C. &sect; 209 (copies of District

of Columbia Codes of Laws). As a rule, such statutes permit a form of authentication

as an adequate substitute for the original document.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 1003. Admissibility of duplicates

Rule 1003 is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule. It is both

 similar to and distinct from the 1969 Manual. To the extent that the Rule

deals with those copies which were intended at the time of their creation

to be used as originals, it is similar to the 1969 Manual's treatment of

"duplicate originals," Para. 143 _a_(1), except

that under the 1969 Manual there was no distinction to be made between originals

and "duplicate originals". Accordingly, in this case the Rule

would be narrower than the 1969 Manual. To the extent that the Rule deals

with copies not intended at their time of creation to serve as originals,

however, _ e.g._, when copies are made of pre-existing documents

for the purpose of litigation, the Rule is broader than the 1969 Manual because

that Manual prohibited such evidence unless an adequate justification for

the non-production of the original existed.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 1004. Admissibility of other evidence of content.

Rule 1004 is taken from the Federal Rule without change, and

is similar in scope to the 1969 Manual. Once evidence comes within the scope

of Rule 1004, secondary evidence is admissible without regard to whether

 "better" forms of that evidence can be obtained. Thus, no priority

 is established once Rule 1002 is escaped. Although the 1969 Manual stated

in Para. 143 _a_(2) that "the contents may be proved

by an authenticated copy or by the testimony of a witness who has seen and

can remember the substance of the writing" when the original need not

be produced, that phrasing appears illustrative only and not exclusive.

Accordingly, the Rule, the Manual, and common law are in agreement in not

 requiring categories of secondary evidence. 

### (1) Originals lost or destroyed.

Rule 1004(1) is similar to the 1969 Manual except that the Rule

 explicitly exempts originals destroyed in "bad faith." Such an

 exemption was implicit in the 1969 Manual. 

### (2) Original not obtained.

Rule 1004(2) is similar to the justification for nonproduction in

 Para. 143 _a_(2) of the 1969 Manual, "an admissible

 writing. . . cannot feasibly be produced." 

### (3) Original in possession of opponent.

 

 Rule 1004(3) is similar to the 1969 Manual provision

in Para. 143 _a_(2) that when a document is in the possession

of the accused the original need not be produced except that the 1969 Manual

explicitly did not require notice to the accused, and the Rule may require

such notice. Under the Rule, the accused must be "put on notice, by

the pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be subject of proof at

the hearing." Thus, under certain circumstances, a formal notice to

the accused may be required. Under no circumstances should such a request

or notice be made in the presence of the court members. The only purpose

of such notice is to justify use of secondary evidence and does not serve

to compel the surrender of evidence from the accused. It should be noted

that Rule 1004(3) acts in favor of the accused as well as the prosecution

and allows notice to the prosecution to justify defense use of secondary

evidence. 

### (4) Collateral matters.

Rule 1004 is not found within the Manual but restates prior military

 law. The intent behind the Rule is to avoid unnecessary delays and expense.

It is important to note that important matters which may appear collateral

may not be so in fact due to their weight. _See, e.g., United States

v. Parker_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 579, 33 C.M.R. 111 (1963) (validity of

divorce decree of critical prosecution witness not collateral when witness

would be prevented from testifying due to spousal privilege if the divorce

were not valid). The Rule incorporates this via its use of the expression

"related to a controlling issue."

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 1005. Copies of public records to prove content.

Rule 1005 is taken verbatim from the Federal Rule except that

 "or attested to" has been added to conform the Rule to the new

Rule 902(4a). The Rule is generally similar to Para. 143 _a_(2)(c)

of the 1969 Manual although some differences do exist. The Rule is somewhat

 broader in that it applies to more than just "official records."

 Further, although the 1969 Manual permitted "a properly authenticated"

copy in lieu of the official record, the Rule allows secondary evidence of

contents when a certified or attested copy cannot be obtained by the exercise

of reasonable diligence. The Rule does, however, have a preference for a

certified or attested copy.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 1006. Summaries to prove content.

Rule 1006 is taken from the Federal Rule without change, and

is similar to the exception to the best evidence rule now found in Para.

143 _a_(2)(b) of the 1969 Manual. Some difference between

the Rule and the 1969 Manual exists, however, because the Rule permits use

of "a chart, summary, or calculation" while the Manual permitted

only "a summarization." Additionally, the Rule does not include

the 1969 Manual requirement that the summarization be made by a "qualified

person or group of qualified persons," nor does the Rule require, as

the Manual appeared to, that the preparer of the chart, summary, or calculation

testify in order to authenticate the document. The nature of the authentication

required is not clear although some form of authentication is required under

Rule 901(a). 

 It is possible for a summary that is admissible

under Rule 1006 to include information that would not itself be admissible

if that information is reasonably relied upon by an expert preparing the

summary. _See generally_ Rule 703 and S. Saltzburg & K.

Redden, FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL 694 (2d ed. 1977).

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 1007. Testimony or statement of a party to prove content.

Rule 1007 is taken from the Federal Rule without change and

had no express equivalent in the 1969 Manual. The Rule establishes an exception

to Rule 1002 by allowing the contents of a writing, recording or photograph

to be proven by the testimony or deposition of the party against whom offered

or by the party's written admission.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 1008. Functions of the military judge and the members.

Rule 1008 is taken from the Federal Rule without change, and

 had no formal equivalent in prior military practice. The Rule specifies three

 situations in which members must determine issues which have been conditionally

 determined by the military judge. The members have been given this responsibility

in this narrow range of issues because the issues that are involved go to

the very heart of a case and may prove totally dispositive. Perhaps the best

example stems from the civil practice. Should the trial judge in a contract

action determine that an exhibit is in fact the original of a contested contract,

that admissibility decision could determine the ultimate result of trial

if the jury were not given the opportunity to be the final arbiter of the

issue. A similar situation could result in a criminal case, for example,

in which the substance of a contested written confession is determinative

(this would be rare because in most cases the fact that a written confession

was made is unimportant, and the only relevant matter is the content of the

oral statement that was later transcribed) or in a case in which the accused

is charged with communication of a written threat. A decision by the military

judge that a given version is authentic could easily determine the trial.

Rule 1008 would give the member the final decision as to accuracy. Although

Rule 1008 will rarely be relevant to the usual court-martial, it will adequately

protect the accused from having the case against him or her depend upon a

single best evidence determination by the military judge.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

# MISCELLANEOUS RULES

## Rule 1101. Applicability of these rules.

The Federal Rules have been revised extensively to adapt them

 to the military criminal legal system. Subdivision (a) of the Federal Rule

 specifies the types of courts to which the Federal Rules are applicable,

and Subdivision (b) of the Federal Rule specifies the types of proceedings

to be governed by the Federal Rules. These sections are inapplicable to the

military criminal legal system and consequently were deleted. Similarly,

most of Federal Rule of Evidence 1101(d) is inapplicable to military law

due to the vastly different jurisdictions involved. 

### (a) Rules applicable.

Rule 1101(a) specifies that the Military Rules are applicable to

all courts-martial including summary courts-martial, to Article 39(a) proceedings,

 limited factfinding proceedings ordered on review, revision proceedings,

and contempt proceedings. This limited application is a direct result of

the limited jurisdiction available to courts-martial. 

### (b) Rules of privilege.

Rule 1101(b) is taken from subdivision (c) of the Federal Rule and

is similar to prior military law. Unlike the Federal Rules, the Military

Rules contain detailed privileges rather than a general reference to common

law. _Compare_ Federal Rule of Evidence 501 with Military

Rule of Evidence 501-512. 

### (c) Rules relaxed.

Rule 1101(c) conforms the rules of evidence to military sentencing

 procedures as set forth in the 1969 Manual Para. 75 _c_.

Courts-martial are bifurcated proceedings with sentencing being an adversarial

 proceeding. Partial application of the rules of evidence is thus appropriate.

 The Rule also recognizes the possibility that other Manual provisions may

now or later affect the application of the rules of evidence. 

### (d) Rules inapplicable.

Rule 1101(d) is taken in concept from subdivision (d) of the Federal

 Rule. As the content of the Federal Rule is, however, generally inapplicable

to military law, the equivalents of the Article III proceedings listed in

the Federal Rule have been listed here. They included Article 32 investigative

 hearings, the partial analog to grand jury proceedings, proceedings for search

 authorizations, and proceedings for pretrial release. 

 _

1993 Amendment._ Mil. R. Evid. 1101(d) was amended to make the provisions

of Mil. R. Evid. 412 applicable at pretrial investigations. 

 _

1998 Amendment._ The Rule is amended to increase to 18 months the

time period between changes to the Federal Rules of Evidence and automatic

amendment of the Military Rules of Evidence. This extension allows for timely

submission of changes through the annual review process.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule to align with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 1102. Amendments.

Rule 1102 has been substantially revised from the original

 Federal Rule which sets forth a procedure by which the Supreme Court promulgates

amendments to the Federal Rules subject to Congressional objection. Although

it is the Committee's intent that the Federal Rules of Evidence apply to

the armed forces to the extent practicable, _see_ Article

36(a), the Federal Rules are often in need of modification to adapt them to

 military criminal legal system. Further, some rules may be impracticable.

As Congress may make changes during the initial period following Supreme

Court publication, some period of time after an amendment's effective date

was considered essential for the armed forces to review the final form of

 amendments and to propose any necessary modifications to the President. Six

 months was considered the minimally appropriate time period.

 

 Amendments to the Federal Rules are not applicable to the armed forces until 180 days

after the effective date of such amendment, unless the President directs

earlier application. In the absence of any Presidential action, however,

an amendment to the Federal Rule of Evidence will be automatically applicable

on the 180th day after its effective date. The President may, however, affirmatively

direct that any such amendment may not apply, in whole or in part, to the

armed forces and that direction shall be binding upon courts-martial.

 _1998 Amendment:_ The Rule is amended to increase to 18 months the

time period between changes to the Federal Rules of Evidence and automatic

 amendment of the Military Rules of Evidence. This extension allows for the

 timely submission of changes through the annual review process. 

_

 2004 Amendment: See_ Executive Order 13365, dated 3 December

2004. The amendment to the Federal Rules of Evidence, effective in United

States District Courts, 1 December 2000, creating Rule 902(12) is not adopted.

 Federal Rules 301, 302, and 415, were not adopted because they were applicable

only to civil proceedings.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

## Rule 1103. Title

In choosing the title, Military Rules of Evidence, the Committee

intends that it be clear that military evidentiary law should echo the civilian

federal law to the extent practicable, but should also ensure that the unique

and critical reasons behind the separate military criminal legal system be

adequately served.

 _2013 Amendment._ The committee recommended revising this rule for stylistic reasons and to align it with the Federal Rules of Evidence, but in doing so did not intend to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.

# ANALYSIS OF PUNITIVE ARTICLES

## Introduction

 

 Unless otherwise indicated, the elements, maximum punishments

and sample specifications in paragraphs 3 through 113 are based on paragraphs

157 through 213, paragraph 127 _c_ (Table of Maximum Punishments),

 and Appendix 6_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ The next to last paragraph of the introduction to

Part IV was added to define the term "elements," as used in Part

IV. In MCM, 1969 (Rev.), the equivalent term used was "proof."

Both "proof" and "elements" referred to the statutory

elements of the offense and to any additional aggravating factors prescribed

by the President under Article 56, UCMJ, to increase the maximum permissible

punishment above that allowed for the basic offense. These additional factors

are commonly referred to as "elements," and judicial construction

has approved this usage, as long as these "elements" are pled,

proven, and instructed upon. _United States v. Flucas_, 23

U.S.C.M.A. 274, 49 C.M.R. 449 (1975); _United States v. Nickaboine

_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 152, 11 C.M.R. 152 (1953); _United States

v. Bernard_, 10 C.M.R. 718 (AFBR 1953). 

## 1. Article 77-Principals

### b. Explanation.

#### (1) Purpose.

Article 77 is based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2. _Hearings on H.

R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services,_ 81st

 Cong., 1st Sess. 1240-1244 (1949). The paragraph of subparagraph b(1) reflects

 the purpose of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2 (_see Standefer v. United States

_, 447 U.S. 10 (1980)) and Article 77 (_see_ Hearings, _

supra_ at 1240). 

 The common law definitions in the second

paragraph of subparagraph b(1) are based on R. Perkins, _Criminal

Law_ 643-666 (2d ed. 1969); and 1 C. Torcia, _Wharton's

Criminal Law and Procedure_ &sect;&sect; 29-38 (1978). Several

common law terms such as "aider and abettor" are now used rather

loosely and do not always retain their literal common law meanings. _

See United States v. Burroughs_, 12 M.J. 380, 384 n.4. (C.M.A. 1982); _

United States v. Molina_, 581 F.2d 56, 61 n.8 (2d Cir. 1978). To

eliminate confusion, the explanation avoids the use of such terms where possible. _

See United States v. Burroughs, supra_ at 382 n.3. 

#### (2) Who may be liable for an offense.

Subparagraph (2)(a) is based on paragraph 156 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _See_ 18 U.S.C.A. &sect; 2 Historical and Revision Notes (West

 1969). _See also_ _United States v. Giles,_ 300

U.S. 41 (1937); _Wharton's, supra_ at &sect;&sect; 30, 31,

35. 

 Subparagraph (2)(b) sets forth the basic formulation of the

 requirements for liability as a principal. An act (which may be passive,

as discussed in this subparagraph) and intent are necessary to make one liable

as a principal. _See United States v. Burroughs, supra; United States

v. Jackson_ , 6 U.S.C.M.A. 193, 19 C.M.R. 319 (1955); _United

States v. Wooten_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 358, 3 C.M.R. 92 (1952); _

United States v. Jacobs_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 209, 2 C.M.R. 115 (1952). _

See also_ _United States v. Walker_, 621 F.2d 163 (5th

Cir. 1980), _ cert. denied_, 450 U.S. 1000 (1981); _

Morei v. United States_, 127 F.2d 827 (6th Cir. 1942); _United

States v. Peoni_, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938). The terms "assist"

and "encourage, advise, and instigate" have been substituted

for "aid" and "abet" respectively, since the latter

terms are technical and may not be clear to the lay reader. _See_ _

Black's Law Dictionary_ 5, 63 (5th ed., 1979). _See also Nye

and Nissen v. United States_, 336 U.S. 613, 620 (1949); _ Wharton's,

_ _ supra_ at 246-47. 

 The last two sentences

in subparagraph (2)(b) are based on the third paragraph and paragraph 156

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See United States v. Ford_, 12 U.S.C.M.A.

31, 30 C.M.R. 31 (1960); _United States v. McCarthy_, 11 U.S.C.M.A.

758, 29 C.M.R. 574 (1960); _ United States v. Lyons_, 11 U.S.C.M.A.

68, 28 C.M.R. 292 (1959). 

#### (3) Presence.

This subparagraph clarifies, as paragraph 156 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

did not, that presence at the scene is neither necessary nor sufficient to

make one a principal. "Aid" and "abet" as used in

18 U.S.C. &sect; 2, and in Article 77, are not used in the narrow common

law sense of an "aider and abettor" who must be present at the

scene to be guilty as such. _United States v. Burroughs, supra; United

States v. Sampol,_ 636 F.2d 621 (D.C. Cir. 1980); _United

States v. Molina, supra; United States v. Carter_, 23 C.M.R. 872

(A.F.B.R. 1957). _Cf. Milanovich v. United States,_ 365 U.S.

551 (1961). _ See also_ _Wharton's,_ _

supra_ at 231. Subparagraph (b) continues the admonition, contained

in the third paragraph of paragraph 156 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), that presence

at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to make one a principal. _

See United State v. Waluski_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 724, 21 C.M.R. 46  (1956); _

United States v. Johnson_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 20, 19 C.M.R. 146 (1955); _

United States v. Guest_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 147, 11 C.M.R. 147 (1953).

#### (4) Parties whose intent differs from the perpetrators.

This subparagraph is based on the first paragraph in paragraph 156

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See United States v. Jackson_, 6 U.S.C.M.A.

 193, 19 C.M.R. 319 (1955); Wharton's, _supra_ at &sect; 35.

#### (5) Responsibility for other crimes.

This paragraph is based on the first two paragraphs in paragraph

156 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See United States v. Cowan_, 12

C.M.R. 374 (A.B.R. 1953); _United States v. Self_, 13 C.M.R.

227 (A.B.R. 1953). 

 _Principals independently liable._ This

 subparagraph is new and is based on Federal decisions. _See Standefer

v. United States, supra; United States v. Chenaur_ , 552 F.2d 294

(9th Cir. 1977); _United States v. Frye_, 548 F.2d 765 (8th

Cir. 1977). 

 _Withdrawal._ This subparagraph is

new and is based on _United States v. Williams_, 19 U.S.C.M.A.

334, 41 C.M.R. 334 (1970). _See also_ _United States

v. Miasel_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 374, 24 C.M.R. 184, 188 (157); _

United States v. Lowell_, 649 F.2d 950 (3d. Cir., 1981); _

United States v. Killian_, 639 F. 2d 206 (5th Cir.), _ cert.

denied_ 451 U.S. 1021 (1981). 

## 2. Article 78-Accessory after the fact

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) In general.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 157 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _See also_ _United States v. Tamas_, 6 U.S.C.M.A.

502, 20 C.M.R. 218 (1955). 

#### (2) Failure to report offense.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 157 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Smith_, 5 M.J. 129 (C.M.A. 1978). 

#### (3) Offense punishable by the code.

This subparagraph is based on Article 78; _United States

v. Michaels_, 3 M.J. 846 (A.C.M.R. 1977); _United States v.

Blevins_, 34 C.M.R. 967 (A.F.B.R. 1964). 

#### (4) Status of principal.

This subparagraph is based on Article 78 and _United States

v. Michaels_, 3 M.J. 846 (A.C.M.R. 1977); _United States v.

 Blevins_, 34 C.M.R. 967 (A.F.B.R. 1964). 

#### (5) Conviction or acquittal of principal.

The subparagraph is based on paragraph 157 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Marsh_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 252, 32 C.M.R. 252

 (1962); and _United States v. Humble_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 38, 28

 C.M.R. 262 (1959). _See also_ _United States v. McConnico

_, 7 M.J. 302 (C.M.A. 1979). 

#### (6) Accessory after the fact not a lesser included offense.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. McFarland

_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 42, 23 C.M.R. 266 (1957). 

#### (7) Actual Knowledge.

 This paragraph is based on _United States v. Marsh_, supra. _

 See United States v. Foushee_, 13 M.J. 833 (A.C.M.R. 1982). MCM,

1984, APPENDIX 21, Part IV, ARTICLE 79.

## 3. Article 79-Lesser included offenses

### b. Explanation.

#### (1) In general.

This subparagraph and the three subparagraphs are based on paragraph

 158 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United States

v. Thacker_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 408, 37 C.M.R. 28 (1966).

  _2012 Amendment_.  In 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces examined Article 79 and clarified the legal test for lesser included offenses. _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). In _Jones_, the Court held that the elements test is the proper method of determining lesser included offenses and that an offense under Article 79 is "necessarily included" in the offense charged only if the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the greater offense alleged. Under the elements test, one must compare the elements of each offense.  If all of the elements of offense X are also elements of offense Y, then X is a lesser included offense of Y. Offense Y is called the greater offense because it contains all of the elements of offense X along with one or more additional elements.  The offenses do not have to use identical statutory language; rather, the court uses normal principles of statutory construction to determine the meaning of each element.  _See Jones_, 68 M.J. at 470; _United States v. Oatney_, 45 M.J. 185 (C.A.A.F. 1996). Practitioners should understand the holding in _Jones_ and carefully apply the elements test on a case-by-case basis.

#### (2) Multiple lesser included offenses.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 158 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _See also_ _United States v. Calhoun_, 5 U.S.C.M.A.

428, 18 C.M.R. 52 (1955). 

#### (3) Findings of guilty to a lesser included offense.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 158 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (4) Specific lesser included offenses.

  _2015 Amendment._ See analysis in paragraph 3.b.(1) above. Lesser included offenses (LIO) listings were removed from each punitive article in paragraphs 1-113 (except paragraphs 1 and 3), Part IV, and were moved to a new Appendix 12A. The LIO listings are determined based on the elements of the greater offense, but are not binding.  Therefore, practitioners should use Appendix 12A only as a guide. To determine if an offense is lesser included, the elements test must be used. _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465, 470 (C.A.A.F. 2010). The offenses are not required to possess identical statutory language; rather, the court uses normal principles of statutory construction to determine the meaning of each element. _See id._ at 470-73; _United States v. Oatney_, 45 M.J. 185 (C.A.A.F. 1996); _Schmuck v. United States_, 489 U.S. 705 (1989).

  Articles 80-133. _See United States v. Girouard_, 70 M.J. 5 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. McMurrin_, 70 M.J. 15 (C.A.A.F. 2011). Article 134 specifications must contain the "terminal element." _See_ paragraphs 60.b and 60.c.(6)(a) in Part IV. _See also United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012); R.C.M. 307(c)(3).

## 4. Article 80-Attempts

### c. Explanation.

 This subparagraph is based on paragraph 159 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (2) More than preparation.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 159 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Johnson_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 488, 22 C.M.R. 278

 (1957); _United States v. Choat_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 187, 21 C.M.R.

 313 (1956); _United States v. Goff_, 5 M.J. 817 (A.C.M.R.

1978); _ United States v. Emerson_, 16 C.M.R. 690 (A.F.B.R.

1954). 

#### (3) Factual impossibility.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 159 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Thomas_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 278, 32 C.M.R. 278

 (1962). _See United States v. Quijada_, 588 F.2d 1253 (9th

Cir. 1978). 

#### (4) Voluntary abandonment.

 

 _1995 Amendment:_ Subparagraph (4)

is new. It recognizes voluntary abandonment as an affirmative defense as

established by the case law. _See United States v. Byrd_,

24 M.J. 286 (C.M.A. 1987). _See also United States v. Schoof_,

37 M.J. 96, 103-04 (C.M.A. 1993); _United States v. Rios_,

33 M.J. 436, 440-41 (C.M.A. 1991); _United States v. Miller_,

30 M.J. 999 (N.M.C.M.R. 1990); _United States v. Walther_,

30 M.J. 829, 829-33 (N.M.C.M.R. 1990). The prior subparagraphs (4) - (6)

have been redesignated (5) - (7), respectively. 

#### (5) Solicitation.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 159 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (6) Attempts not under Article 80.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 159 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ In 4_c_(5), subparagraph (e) was

redesignated as subparagraph (f), and a new subparagraph (e) was added to

reflect the offense of attempted espionage as established by the Department

of Defense Authorization Act, 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-145, &sect; 534, 99 Stat.

583, 634-35 (1985) (art. 106a). 

#### (7) Regulations.

This subparagraph is new and is based on _United States v.

 Davis_, 16 M.J. 225 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States v. Foster

_, 14 M.J. 246 (C.M.A. 1983). 

### e. Maximum punishment

 

 _1991 Amendment:_ This paragraph was revised

to allow for the imposition of confinement in excess of 20 years for the

offense of attempted murder. There are cases in which the aggravating factors

surrounding commission of an attempted murder are so egregious that a 20

year limitation may be inappropriate. Although life imprisonment may be imposed

by the sentencing authority, mandatory minimum punishment provisions do not

apply in the case of convictions under Article 80. 

## 5. Article 81-Conspiracy

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) Co-conspirators.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 160 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Kinder_, 14 C.M.R. 742 (A.F.B.R. 1953).

The portion of paragraph 160 which provided that acquittal of all alleged

 co-conspirators precludes conviction of the accused has been deleted. _

C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law, &sect; 731 (1981). _See Iannelli

v. United States_, 420 U.S. 770 (1975); _United States v.

 Yarborough_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 678, 5 C.M.R. 106 (1952); _United

 States v. Osthoff_, 8 M.J. 629 (A.C.M.R. 1979); _United States

 v. McClelland_, 49 C.M.R. 557 (A.C.M.R. 1974). 

#### (4) Overt act.

 (1957). 

#### (7) Factual impossibility.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 160 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (8) Conspiracy as a separate offense.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 160 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

M.J. 473 (C.M.A. 1976).

 intent offense. _See_ paragraph 161 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

paragraph 161 of MCM, 1951. _See generally United States v. Mitchell

_, 15 M.J. 214 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States v. Benton_,

 238 (1957); _United States v. Benton_, 7 M.J. 606 (N.C.M.R.

1979). 

## 7. Article 83-Fraudulent enlistment, appointment, or separation

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 162 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _

 United States v. Danley_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 486, 45 C.M.R. 260 (1972).

 _See Wickham v. Hall_, 12 M.J. 145 (C.M.A. 1981). 

### e. Maximum Punishment.

The reference to membership in, association with, or activities

in connection with organizations, associations, etc., found in the Table

of Maximum Punishments, paragraph 127 _c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.),

for Article 83, was deleted as unnecessary. The maximum punishment for all

 fraudulent enlistment cases was then standardized. 

## 8. Article 84-Effecting unlawful enlistment, appointment, or separation

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 163 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _See also_ _United States v. Hightower_, 5

M.J. 717 (A.C.M.R. 1978). 

### e. Maximum punishment.

The reference to membership in, with, or activities in connection

 with organizations, associations, etc., found in the Table of Maximum Punishments,

paragraph 127_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), or Article 84, was deleted

as unnecessary. The maximum punishment for all cases was then standardized.

## 9. Article 85-Desertion

### c. Explanation.

(1) Desertion with intent to remain away permanently. 

##### (a) In general.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 164a of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

##### (b) Absence without authority-inception, duration, termination.

 _See_ the Analysis, paragraph 10. 

##### (c) Intent to remain away permanently.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 164_a_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The last sentence is based on _United States v.

Cothern_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 158, 23 C.M.R. 382 (1957). 

##### (d) Effect of enlistment or appointment in the same or a different armed

 force.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 164_a_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Huff_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 247,

22 C.M.R. 37 (1956). 

#### (2) Quitting unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid

 hazardous duty or to shirk important service.

##### (a) Hazardous duty or important service.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 164 _a_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ _United States v. Smith

_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 46, 39 C.M.R. 46 (1968); _United States v.

Deller_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 409, 12 C.M.R. 165 (1953). 

##### (b) Quits.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. Bondar_,

2 U.S.C.M.A. 357, 8 C.M.R. 157 (1953). 

##### (c) Actual Knowledge.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. Stabler

_, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 125, 15 C.M.R. 125 (1954) and rejects the view of

paragraph 164 _a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) that constructive knowledge

would suffice. To avoid confusion, the "constructive knowledge"

language has been replaced with the statement that actual knowledge may be

proved by circumstantial evidence. _See United States v. Curtin_,

9 U.S.C.M.A. 427, 26 C.M.R. 207 (1958). 

#### (3) Attempting to desert.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 164_b_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

#### (4) Prisoner with executed punitive discharge.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraphs 164_a_ and

 165 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### e. Maximum punishment.

As indicated in the Analysis, paragraph 4, attempts, the punishment

 for attempted desertion was made uniform. As a result, attempted desertion-

 "other cases of"- now conforms with the punishment for "desertion-

other cases of." This amounts to an increase in the maximum punishment

from confinement for one year to either two or three years, depending on

the nature of termination. 

## 10. Article 86-Absence without leave

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) In general.

 This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 165 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (2) Actual knowledge.

This subparagraph clarifies that the accused must have in fact known

 of the time and place of duty to be guilty of a violation of Article 86(1)

or (2). _Cf. United States v. Chandler_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 193,

48 C.M.R. 945 (1974); _United States v. Stabler_, 4 U.S.C.M.A.

125, 15 C.M.R. 125 (1954). _See also_ _United States

v. Gilbert_, 23 C.M.R. 914 (A.F.B.R. 1957). The language in paragraph

165 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) dealing with constructive knowledge has been eliminated.

To avoid confusion, this language has been replaced with the statement that

actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence. _See United

States v. Curtin_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 427, 26 C.M.R. 207 (1958). 

#### (3) Intent.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 165 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (4) Aggravated forms of unauthorized absence.

 This subparagraph is based on paragraphs 127_c_ and

 165 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

#### (5) Civil authorities.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 165_f_ MCM,

 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Myhre_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 32, 25

 C.M.R. 294 (1958); _United States v. Grover_, 10 U.S.C.M.A.

91, 27 C.M.R. 165 (1958). _See also_ _United States

v. Dubry_, 12 M.J. 36 (C.M.A. 1981). 

#### (6) Inability to return.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 165 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (7) Determining the unit or organization of an accused.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. Pounds_,

23 U.S.C.M.A. 153, 48 C.M.R. 769 (1974); _United States v. Mitchell

_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 238, 22 C.M.R. 28 (1956). 

#### (8) Duration.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraphs 127 _c_ and

 165 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Lovell_, 7 U.S.C.M.A.

 445, 22 C.M.R. 235 (1956). 

#### (9) Computation of duration.

This subsection is based on paragraph 127_c_(3)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

#### (10) Termination-methods of return to military control.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 165 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Dubry, supra;_ _United States v.

Raymo_, 1 M.J. 31 (C.M.A. 1975); _ United States v. Garner

_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 578, 23 C.M.R. 42 (1957); _United States v.

Coates_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 625, 10 C.M.R. 123 (1953); _United States

v. Jackson_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 190, 2 C.M.R. 96 (1952); _United

States v. Petterson_, 14 M.J. 608 (A.F.C.M.R. 1982); _United

States v. Coglin_, 10 M.J. 670 (A.F.C.M.R. 1981). _See also

_ _United States v. Zammit_, 14 M.J. 554 (N.M.C.M.R.

1982). 

#### (11) Findings of more than one absence under one specification.

This subsection is based on _United States v. Francis_,

15 M.J. 424 (C.M.A. 1983). 

### (e) Maximum punishment.

The increased maximum punishment for unauthorized absence for more

 than 30 days terminated by apprehension has been added to parallel the effect

 of termination of desertion by apprehension and to encourage absent servicemembers

to voluntarily return. A bad-conduct discharge was added to the permissible

maximum punishment for unauthorized absence with intent to avoid maneuvers

of field duty, because with sensitive, high value equipment used in exercises

currently, the effect of such absence is more costly and, because of limited

available training time, seriously disrupts training and combat readiness. 

 _

1990 Amendment:_ The Note in subsection b(4) was inserted and a conforming

change was made in subsection f(4) to clarify the distinction between "unauthorized

absence from a guard, watch, or duty section" and "unauthorized

absence from guard, watch, or duty section with the intent to abandon it." _

See_ subsections c(4)(c) and c(4)(d). 

## 11. Article 87-Missing movement

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) Movement.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 166 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Kimply_, 17 C.M.R. 469 (N.B.R. 1954). 

#### (2) Mode of movement.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. Graham_ ,

16 M.J. 460 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States v. Johnson_, 3 U.S.C.M.A.

174, 11 C.M.R. 174 (1953); _United States v. Burke_, 6 C.M.R.

588 (A.B.R. 1952); _United States v. Jackson_, 5 C.M.R. 429

(A.B.R. 1952). _See also_ _United States v. Graham_,

12 M.J. 1026 (A.C.M.R.), _pet granted_, 14 M.J. 223 (1982). 

#### (3) Design.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. Clifton

_, 5 C.M.R. 342 (N.B.R. 1952). 

#### (4) Neglect.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 166 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (5) Actual knowledge.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. Chandler

_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 193, 48 C.M.R. 945 (1974); _United States

v. Thompson_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 460, 9 C.M.R. 90 (1953); and in part on

paragraph 166 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). This paragraph rejects the language of

 paragraph 166 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which has provided for "constructive

 knowledge," and adopts the "actual knowledge" requirement

set forth in _Chandler_. 

#### (6) Proof of absence.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 166 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for missing movement was increased to make

 these punishments more equivalent to aggravated offenses of unauthorized

 absences and violations of orders. The major reliance of the armed forces

on rapid deployment and expeditious movement of personnel and equipment to

deter or prevent the escalation of hostilities dictates that these offenses

be viewed more seriously. 

## 12. Article 88-Contempt toward officials

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 167 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

For a discussion of the history of Article 88, _see United States

v. Howe_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 165, 37 C.M.R. 429 (1967). 

### e. Maximum punishment.

This limitation is new and is based on the authority given the

President in Article 56. Paragraph 127_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), does not mention Article 88. The maximum punishment is based on the maximum

 punishment for Article of War 62, which was analogous to Article 88, as

prescribed in paragraph 117_c_ of MCM (Army), 1949, and MCM

 (AF), 1949.

 _2007 Amendment_.  The analysis for paragraph 12a is amended by replacing the word "Transportation" with the words "Homeland Security" to reflect the reorganization of the United States Coast Guard under the Department of Homeland Security.

 

## 13. Article 89-Disrespect toward a superior commissioned officer

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from Article 1(5); paragraph 168 of MCM,

1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Richardson_, 7 M.J. 320 (C.M.A.

1979); _United States v. Ferenczi_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 3, 27 C.M.R.

77  (1958); _United States v. Sorrells_, 49 C.M.R. 44 (A.C.M.R.

1974); _United States v. Cheeks_, 43 C.M.R. 1013 (A.F.C.M.R.

1971); _United States v. Montgomery_, 11 C.M.R. 308 (A.B.R.

1953). 

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment was increased from confinement for 6 months

to confinement for 1 year to more accurately reflect the serious nature of

the offense and to distinguish it from disrespect toward warrant officers

under Article 91. _See_ paragraph 15_c._

## 14. Article 90-Assaulting or willfully disobeying superior commissioned

officer

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) Striking or assaulting superior commissioned officer.

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and other authorities as noted below.

touching. Other batteries, such as by culpable negligence, are included in

"offers violence." As to "superior commissioned officer," _

see_ Analysis, paragraph 13.

##### (d) Defenses.

This subparagraph modifies the former discussion of self-defense

 since technically, because unlawfulness is not an element expressly, the

 officer must be acting illegally or otherwise outside the role of an officer

 before self-defense may be in issue. _See United States v. Struckman

_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 493, 43 C.M.R. 333 (1971).

742 (A.B.R. 1954). 

###### (ii) 2005 Amendment:

The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces held that the lawfulness of an order is a question of law to be determined by the military judge, not the trier of fact.  _See United States v. New_, 55 M.J. 95, 100-01 (C.A.A.F. 2001).

###### (iii) Authority of issuing officer.

dealing with matters that do not excuse the disobedience of an order). 

###### (v) Relationship to statutory or constitutional rights.

This subparagraph is based on Article 31; _United States

v. McCoy_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 68, 30 C.M.R. 68 (1960); _United

States v. Aycock_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 158, 35 C.M.R. 130 (1964). 

##### (b) Personal nature of the order.

 _See United States v. Wartsbaugh_, 21 U.S.C.M.A.

## 15. Article 91-Insubordinate conduct toward warrant officer, noncommissioned

officer, or petty officer

### c. Explanation.

(1) _In general._ This subparagraph is based on

paragraph 170 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and paragraph 170 of MCM, 1951; a review

of the legislative history of Article 91; _United States v. Ransom

_, 1 M.J. 1005 (N.C.M.R. 1976); _ United States v. Balsarini

_, 36 C.M.R. 809 (C.G.B.R. 1965). Paragraph 170 of MCM, 1951 and

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) discussed Article 91 as if Congress had required a superior-subordinate

relationship in Article 91. _See Legal and Legislative Basis, Manual

for Courts-Martial, United States, 1951, at 257. Analysis of Contents, Manual

for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition)_, DA PAM

27-2, at 28-6. This was in error and all references thereto have

been removed. An amendment to Article 91 was suggested by The Judge Advocate

General of the Army (_see Hearings on S.857 and H.R. 4080 Before a

Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Service Committee_, 81st Cong.,

1st Sess. 274 (1949)) to conform Article 91 to Articles 89 and 90, which

explicitly require superiority, and was later offered, but it was not acted

on. _See_ Congressional Floor Debate on the Uniform Code of

Military Justice (amendment M. p. 170). _See also Hearings Before

a Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee on H.R. 2498_,

81st Cong. 1st Sess. 772, 814, 823 (1949). This present interpretation is

consistent with the unambiguous language of Article 91 and its predecessors. _

See_ Articles of War 65 and 1(b) (1920); and paragraph 135, MCM,

1928; paragraph 153, MCM, (Army), 1949 and MCM (AF), 1949. _See also

_ Act of Aug. 10, 1956, Pub.L. No. 84-1028, &sect;49(e), 70A

Stat. 640 (catchlines in U.C.M.J. not relevant to congressional intent). 

 The

remaining subparagraphs are all taken from paragraph 170 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

and the discussion paragraphs of other articles. 

### e. Maximum punishment.

Subparagraphs (2) and (7) are based on the aggravating circumstances

 that the victim is also superior to the accused. When this factor exists

in a given case, the superiority of the victim must be alleged in the specification.

 The penalties for disobedience of noncommissioned and petty officers and

for assault on and disrespect toward superior noncommissioned and petty officers

 were increased. In the case of the latter two offenses, this is done in part

to distinguish assault on or disrespect toward a superior noncommissioned

or petty officer from other assaults or disrespectful behavior, in light

of the expansive coverage of the article. Moreover, increasing responsibility

for training, complex and expensive equipment, and leadership in combat is

placed on noncommissioned and petty officers in today's armed forces. The

law should reinforce the respect and obedience which is due them with meaningful

 sanctions. The maximum punishment for disrespect toward warrant officers

was adjusted to conform to these changes. 

## 16. Article 92-Failure to obey order or regulation

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 171 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

The requirement that actual knowledge be an element of an Article 92(3) offense

is based on _United States v. Curtin_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 427, 26

C.M.R. 207 (1958). 

 As to publication under subparagraph c(1)(a), _

see United States v. Tolkach_, 14 M.J. 239 (C.M.A. 1982). 

 Subparagraph

(1)(e)_ Enforceability_ is new. This subparagraph is based

on _United States v. Nardell_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 327, 45 C.M.R.

101 (1972); _United States v. Hogsett_ , 8 U.S.C.M.A. 681,

25 C.M.R. 185 (1958). The general order or regulation violated must, when

examined as a whole, demonstrate that it is intended to regulate the conduct

of individual servicemembers, and the direct application of sanctions for

violations of the regulation must be self-evident. _ United States

v. Nardell, supra_ at 329, 45 C.M.R. at 103. _See United States

v. Wheeler_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 149, 46 C.M.R. 149(1973); _United

States v. Scott_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 25, 46 C.M.R. 24 (1972); _

United States v. Woodrum_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 529, 43 C.M.R. 369 (1971); _

United States v. Brooks_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 42, 42 C.M.R. 220 (1970); _

United States v. Baker_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 504, 40 C.M.R. 216 (1969); _

United States v. Tassos_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 12, 39 C.M.R. 12 (1968); _

United States v. Farley_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 730, 29 C.M.R. 546 (1960);

DiChiara, _Article 92; Judicial Guidelines for Identifying Punitive

Orders and Regulations_, 17 A.F.L. Rev. Summer 1975 at 61. 

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for willful dereliction of duty was increased

 from 3 months to 6 months confinement and to include a bad-conduct discharge

 because such offenses involve a flaunting of authority and are more closely

 analogous to disobedience offenses.

 

 _February 1986 Amendment:

_ The rule was revised to add constructive knowledge as an alternative

to the actual knowledge requirement in paragraph

(_b_)(3)(_b_) and the related explanation in subparagraph c(3)(b). In reviewing

these provisions, it was concluded that the reliance of the drafters of the

1984 revision on the_ Curtin_ case was misplaced because the

portion of that case dealt with failure to obey under Article 92(2), not

dereliction under Article 92(3). As revised, the elements and the explanation

add an objective standard appropriate for military personnel.

 _2015 Amendment_: Subsection b(3) was amended to increase the punishment for dereliction of duty when such dereliction results in grievous bodily harm or death. Subsection b(3)(d) incorporates a recommendation of the May 2013 report of the Defense Legal Policy Board (DLPB), Report of the Subcommittee on Military Justice in Combat Zones. The DLPB is a Federal Advisory Committee established to provide independent advice to the Secretary of Defense. The DLPB subcommittee primarily focused on civilian casualties in a deployed environment, and the DLPB found that the maximum punishment for dereliction of duty was not commensurate with the potential consequences of dereliction resulting in civilian casualties. The DLPB also found that the available punishment did not make alternative dispositions to court-martial a practical option because there was little incentive for an accused to accept these alternatives. This rule expands on the recommendation of the DLPB and includes elevated maximum punishment for dereliction of duty that results in death or grievous bodily harm suffered by any person.

## 17. Article 93-Cruelty and maltreatment

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 172 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _

 United States v. Dickey_, 20 C.M.R. 486 (A.B.R. 1956). The phrase

 "subject to the Code or not" was added to reflect the fact that

the victim could be someone other than a member of the military. The example

of sexual harassment was added because some forms of such conduct are nonphysical

 maltreatment. 

## 18. Article 94-Mutiny and sedition

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 173 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 Subparagraph (1) is also based on _United States v. Woolbright_,

 12 U.S.C.M.A. 450, 31 C.M.R. 36 (1961);

 _United States v. Duggan_,

4 U.S.C.M.A. 396, 15 C.M.R. 396 (1954). The reference in paragraph 173 of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.) to charging failure to report an impending mutiny or sedition

 under Article 134 has been deleted in subparagraph (4). This is because such

an offense was not listed in the Table of Maximum Punishments or elsewhere

under Article 134 in that Manual. Article of War 67 included this offense,

but Article 94 excludes it. The drafters of paragraph 173 of MCM, 1951 noted

the change. To fill the gap they referred to Article 134. Instead, they should

have referred to Article 92(3) because dereliction is the gravamen of the

offense. 

## 19. Article 95-Resistance, breach of arrest, and escape

### b. Elements.

The elements listed for breaking arrest and escape from custody

or confinement have been modified. Paragraph 174 _b, c_, and

 _d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) provided that the accused be "duly"

placed in arrest, custody, or confinement. "Duly" was deleted

from the elements of these offenses. Instead, the elements specify that the

restraint be imposed by one with authority to impose it. This was done to

clarify the meaning of the word "duly" and the burden of going

forward on the issues of authority to order restraint and the legal basis

for the decision to order restraint. 

 "Duly" means

"in due or proper form or manner, according to legal requirements." _

Black's Law Dictionary_ 450 (5th ed. 1979). _See also United

States v. Carson_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 407, 35 C.M.R. 379 (1965). Thus

the term includes a requirement that restraint be imposed by one with authority

 to do so, and a requirement that such authority be exercised lawfully. Until

 1969, the Manual also provided that arrest, confinement, or custody which

is "officially imposed is presumed to be legal." Paragraph 174

of MCM, 1951. _See also_ paragraph 157 of MCM, (Army), 1949,

MCM (AF), 1949; paragraph 139 of MCM, 1928. In practical effect, therefore,

the prosecution had only to present some evidence of the authority of the

official imposing restraint to meet its burden of proof, unless the presumption

of legality was rebutted by some evidence. _See United States v. Delagado

_, 12 C.M.R. 651 (C.G.B.R. 1953). _Cf. United States v. Clansey

_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 230, 22 C.M.R. 20 (1956); _United States v.

Gray_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 615, 20 C.M.R. 331 (1956). 

 The drafters

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), deleted the presumption of legality. In their view the

holding in _United States v. Carson, supra_, that this is

a question of law to be decided by the military judge made such a presumption

meaningless. _Analysis of Contents, Manual for Courts-Martial, United

States, 1969 (Revised edition)_, DA PAM 27-2, at 28-8.

The drafters considered deleting "duly" as an element but did

not because the prosecution must show that restraint was "duly"

imposed. _Id._ The result left the implication that the prosecution

must produce evidence of both the authority of the person imposing or ordering

restraint, and the legality of that official's decision in every case, whether

or not the latter is contested. Given the dual meaning of the word "duly"

and the reason for deleting the presumption of legality, it is unclear whether

the drafters intended this result. _Cf. United States v. Stinson_,

43 C.M.R. 595 (A.C.M.R. 1970). 

 "Duly" is replaced

with the requirement that the person ordering restraint be proved to have

authority to do so. This clarifies that proof of arrest, custody, or confinement

ordered by a person with authority to do so is sufficient without proof of

the underlying basis for the restraint (e.g., probable cause, legally sufficient

nonjudicial punishment, risk of flight), unless the latter is put in issue

by the defense. This is consistent with Article 95 which on its face does

not require the restraint to be lawful (_compare_ Article

95 _with_ Articles 90-92 which prohibit violations of

"_lawful_ orders"-which orders are presumed

lawful in the absence of evidence to the contrary. _United States

v. Smith_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 231, 45 C.M.R. 5 (1972)). This construction

is also supported by judicial decisions. _See United States v. Wilson

_, 6 M.J. 214 (C.M.A. 1979); _ United States v. Clansey, supra;

United States v. Yerger_, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 288, 3 C.M.R. 22 (1952); _

United States v. Delgado, supra. Cf. United States v. Mackie_, 16

U.S.C.M.A. 14, 36 C.M.R. 170 (1966); _ United States v. Gray, supra.

But see United States v. Rozier_, 1 M.J. 469 (C.M.A. 1976). This

construction also avoids unnecessary litigation of a collateral issue and

eliminates the necessity for the introduction of uncharged misconduct, except

when the door is opened by the defense. _Cf. United States v. Yerger,

supra; United States v. Mackie, supra._ 

 _1991 Amendment:

_ Subparagraph b(4) was amended by adding an aggravating element

of post-trial confinement to invoke increased punishment for escapes from

post-trial confinement. 

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) Resisting apprehension.

##### (a) Apprehension.

This subparagraph is taken from Article 7. 

##### (b) Authority to apprehend.

 _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 302(b). The last two sentences

are based on paragraph 57_a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);_

United States v. Carson, supra._ 

##### (c) Nature of the resistance.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 174_a_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

##### (d) Mistake.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 174_a_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Nelson_, 17

U.S.C.M.A. 620, 38 C.M.R. 418 (1968). 

##### (e) Illegal apprehension.

The first sentence of this subparagraph is taken from paragraph

 174_a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Although such a rule is not without

 criticism, _see United States v. Lewis_, 7 M.J. 348 (C.M.A.

 1979); _United States v. Moore_, 483 F.2d 1361, 1364 (9th

Cir.1973), it has long been recognized in military and civilian courts. _

John Bad Elk v. United States_, 177 U.S. 529 (1900); paragraph 174_a_ of MCM, 1951. _Cf._ paragraph 157 of MCM (Army),

1949; MCM (AF), 1949; paragraph 139 of MCM, 1928; W. Winthrop,_ Military

Law and Precedents_ 122 (2d ed. 1920 reprint). (Before 1951 resisting

 apprehension was not specifically prohibited by the Articles of War. Earlier

 references are to breaking arrest or escape from confinement.) 

 The

second sentence has been added to make clear that the issue of legality of

an apprehension (e.g., whether based on probable cause or otherwise in accordance

with requirements for legal sufficiency; _see_ R.C.M. 302(e))

is not in issue until raised by the defense. _United States v. Wilson

_, and_ United States v. Clansey_, both _supra.

Cf. United States v. Smith_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 231, 45 C.M.R. 5 (1972). _

See also_ Analysis, paragraph 19_b_. The presumption

is a burden assigning device; it has no evidentiary weight once the issue

is raised. Because the issue of legality is not an element, and because the

prosecution bears the burden of establishing legality when the issue is raised,

the problems of _Mullaney v. Wilbur_, 421 U.S. 684 (1975)

and _Turner v. United States_, 396 U.S. 398 (1970) are not

encountered. _Cf. Patterson v. New York_, 432 U.S. 197 (1977). 

 The

third sentence is based on _United States v. Carson, supra._

#### (2) Breaking arrest.

##### (a) Arrest.

This subparagraph has been added for clarity. 

##### (b) Authority to order arrest.

 _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 304(b); R.C.M. 1101; and

paragraph 2, Part V. 

##### (c) Nature of restraint imposed by arrest.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 174_b_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also_ Analysis, paragraph 19_b_. 

##### (d) Breaking.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 174 _b_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

##### (e) Illegal arrest.

The first sentence in this subparagraph is based on paragraph 174_b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence has been added to clarify

that legality of an arrest (e.g., whether based on probable cause or based

on legally sufficient nonjudicial punishment or court-martial sentence) is

not in issue until raised by the defense. _See_ Analysis, paragraphs

19_b_ and 19_c_(1)(e). The third sentence

is based on _United States v. Carson, supra._ 

#### (3) Escape from custody.

##### (a) Custody.

This subparagraph is taken from paragraph 174_d_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). As to the distinction between escape from custody and escape

 from confinement, _see United States v. Ellsey_, 16 U.S.C.M.A.

 455, 37 C.M.R. 75 (1966). _But see United States v. Felty_,

12 M.J. 438 (C.M.A. 1982). 

##### (b) Authority to apprehend.

 _See_ Analysis, paragraph 19_c_(1)(b).

##### (c) Escape.

This cross-reference is based on paragraph 174_c_ of

 MCM, 1969 (rev.). 

##### (d) Illegal custody.

The first sentence in this subparagraph is based on paragraph 174_b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The second sentence has been added to clarify

that legality of custody (e.g., whether based on probable cause) is not in

issue until raised by the defense. _See_ Analysis, paragraphs

19_b_ and 19_c_(1)(_e_). The

third sentence is based on _United States v. Carson, supra._

#### (4) Escape from confinement.

##### (a) Confinement.

 _See_ Article 9(a). _See also_ Analysis,

R.C.M. 305; R.C.M. 1101; and paragraph 5_c_, Part V. 

 _

1991 Amendment:_ Subparagraph c(4)(a) was amended to specify that

escape from post-trial confinement is subject to increased punishment. 

##### (b) Authority to order confinement.

 _See_ Analysis, R.C.M. 304(b); R.C.M. 1101; and

paragraph 2, Part V. 

##### (c) Escape.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 174_c_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Maslanich_, 13

M.J. 611 (A.F.C.M.R. 1982). 

##### (d) Status when temporarily outside confinement facility.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. Silk_,

 37 C.M.R. 523 (A.B.r. 1966); _United States v. Sines_, 34

C.M.R. 716 (N.B.R. 1964). 

##### (e) Legality of confinement.

This subparagraph is based on 174_a_ of MCM, 1969

 (Rev.). The second sentence has been added to clarify that legality of confinement

(e.g., whether based on probable cause or otherwise in accordance with requirements

for legal sufficiency) is not in issue until raised by the defense. _

See_ Analysis, paragraphs 19_b_ and 19_c_(1)(e). The third sentence is based on _United States v.

Carson, supra._ 

 _1991 Amendment:_ Subparagraphs _

e_ and _f_ were amended to provide increased punishment

for escape from post-trial confinement. The increased punishment reflects

the seriousness of the offense and is consistent with other federal law. _

See_ 18 U.S.C. 751(a). 

 _1998 Amendment:_ Subparagraphs _

a, b, c,_ and _f_ were amended to implement the amendment

to 10 U.S.C. &sect;895 (Article 95, UCMJ) contained in section 1112 of the

 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106,

 110 Stat. 186, 461 (1996). The amendment proscribes fleeing from apprehension

 without regard to whether the accused otherwise resisted apprehension. The

 amendment responds to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces decisions

 in _United States v. Harris_, 29 M.J. 169 (C.M.A. 1989), and

 _United States v. Burgess_, 32 M.J. 446 (C.M.A. 1991). In

both cases, the court held that resisting apprehension does not include fleeing

from apprehension, contrary to the then-existing explanation in Part IV,

paragraph 19c.(1)(c), MCM, of the nature of the resistance required for resisting

 apprehension. The 1951 and 1969 Manuals for Courts-Martial also explained

that flight could constitute resisting apprehension under Article 95, an

 interpretation affirmed in the only early military case on point,_

United States v. Mercer_, 11 C.M.R. 812 (A.F.B.R. 1953). Flight

from apprehension should be expressly deterred and punished under military

law.  Military personnel are specially trained and routinely expected to

submit to lawful authority. Rather than being a merely incidental or reflexive

action, flight from apprehension in the context of the armed forces may have

a distinct and cognizable impact on military discipline. 

## 20. Article 96-Releasing prisoner without proper authority

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 175 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _

 United States v. Johnpier_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 90, 30 C.M.R. 90 (1961).

 Subparagraphs (1)(c) and (d) have been modified to conform to rules elsewhere

 in this Manual and restated for clarity. 

## 21. Article 97-Unlawful detention

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 176 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _

 United States v. Johnson_, 3 M.J. 361 (C.M.A. 1977). The explanation

of the scope of Article 97 is new and results from _Johnson_ and

 the legislative history of Article 97 cited therein. _Id._ at

 363 n.6. 

## 22. Article 98-Noncompliance with procedural rules

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 177 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for intentional failure to enforce or comply

 with provisions of the Code has been increased from that specified in paragraph

 127_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) to more accurately reflect the

 seriousness of this offense. _See generally_ 18 U.S.C. &sect;

 1505, the second paragraph of which prohibits acts analogous to those prohibited

in Article 98(2). 

## 23. Article 99-Misbehavior before the enemy

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraphs 178 and 183_a_

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Sperland_, 1 U.S.C.M.A.

 661, 5 C.M.R. 89 (1952) (discussion of "before or in the presence of

the enemy"); _United States v. Parker_, 3 U.S.C.M.A.

541, 13 C.M.R. 97 (1953) (discussion of "running away"); _

## 24. Article 100-Subordinate compelling surrender

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 179 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

## 25. Article 101-Improper use of countersign

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 180 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

## 26. Article 102-Forcing a safeguard

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 181 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

Note that a "time of war" need not exist for the commission of

this offense. _See Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcomm. of the

House Comm. on Armed Services_, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 1229 (1949)._

 See also United States v. Anderson_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 588, 38 C.M.R.

386 (1968) (concerning a state of belligerency short of formal war). 

## 27. Article 103-Captured or abandoned property

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 182 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishments based on value have been revised. Instead

of three levels ($50 or less, $50 to $100, and over $100), only two are used.

This is simpler and conforms more closely to the division between felony

and misdemeanor penalties contingent on value in property offenses in civilian

 jurisdictions.

 _2002 Amendment:_ The monetary amount

affecting the maximum punishments has been revised from $100 to $500 to account

for inflation. The last change was in 1969 raising the amount to $100. The

value has also been readjusted to realign it more closely with the division

between felony and misdemeanor penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _

 Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting $500 as the value). The amendment also adds

the phrase "or any firearm or explosive" as an additional criterion.

 This is because, regardless of the intrinsic value of such items, the threat

to the community is substantial when such items are wrongfully bought, sold,

 traded, dealt in or disposed.

## 30. Article 106-Spies

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 185 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _See generally_ W. Winthrop,_ Military Law and Precedents

_ 766-771 (2d ed. 1920 reprint). Subparagraphs (4) and (6)(b)

are also based on Annex to Hague Convention No. IV, Respecting the law and

customs of war on land, Oct. 18, 1907, Arts. XXIX and XXXI, 36 Stat. 2303,

 T.S. No. 539, at 33. 

## 30a. Article 106a-Espionage

Article 106a was added to the UCMJ in the Department of Defense

 Authorization Act, 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-145, &sect; 534, 99 Stat. 583,

 634-35 (1985). 

### c. Explanation.

The explanation is based upon H.R. Rep. No. 235, 99th Cong., 1st

 Sess. (1985), containing the statement of conferees with respect to the

legislation establishing Article 106a. _See also_ 1985 U.S.

Code Cong. & Ad. News 472, 577-79. 

 _1995 Amendment:

_ This subparagraph was amended to clarify that the intent element

of espionage is not satisfied merely by proving that the accused acted without

lawful authority. Article 106a, Uniform Code of Military Justice. The accused

must have acted in bad faith. _United States v. Richardson_,

33 M.J. 127 (C.M.A. 1991); _see Gorin v. United States_, 312

U.S. 19, 21 n.1 (1941). 

## 31. Article 107-False official statements

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) Official documents and statements.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 186 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Cummings_, 3 M.J. 246 (C.M.A. 1977). _

 See also United States v. Collier_, 23 U.S.C.M.A. 713, 48 C.M.R.

789 (1974) (regarding voluntary false statement to military police). 

#### (2) Status of victim.

The first sentence of this subparagraph is based on _United

 States v. Cummings, supra._ The second sentence is based on _

 United States v. Ragins_, 11 M.J. 42 (C.M.A. 1981). 

#### (3) Intent to deceive.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 186 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Hutchins_, 5 U.S.C.M.A. 422, 18 C.M.R. 46

 (1955). 

#### (4) Material gain.

This subparagraph is based on paragraph 186 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### (5) Knowledge that the document or statement was false.

This subparagraph is based on the language of Article 107 and on

 _United States v. Acosta_, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 341, 41 C.M.R. 341

 (1970), and clarifies- as paragraph 186 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), did not-

that actual knowledge of the falsity is necessary. _See also United

States v. DeWayne_, 7 M.J. 755 (A.C.M.R. 1979); _United States

v. Wright_, 34 C.M.R. 518 (A.B.R. 1963); _ United States v.

Hughes_, 19 C.M.R. 631 (A.F.B.R. 1955).

 _2002 Amendment:

_Subparagraph c(6), "Statements made during an interrogation,"

was removed in light of questions raised by the Court of Appeals for the

Armed Forces in _United States v. Solis_, 46 M.J. 31, 35 (C.A.A.F.

1997). In _ Solis_, the court said subparagraph c(6) could

be viewed as serving at least three different purposes. It could be (1) an

expansive description of dicta with no intent to limit prosecutions; (2)

protection for an accused against overcharging; or (3) guidance for the conduct

of investigations. Subparagraph c(6) was never intended to establish either

procedural rights for an accused or internal guidelines to regulate government

conduct. Subparagraph (c)(6) was based upon _United States v. Aronson

_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 525, 25 C.M.R. 29 (1957); _United States v.

Washington_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 131, 25 C.M.R. 393 (1958) and _

United States v. Davenport_, 9 M.J. 364 (C.M.A. 1980) and was intended

merely to describe the rule developed in those cases that a false statement

to a law enforcement agent, when made by a servicemember without an independent

duty to speak, was not "official" and therefore not within the

purview of Article 107. The subparagraph is removed because the position

of the Court of Military Appeals in the three decisions noted above was abandoned

in _ United States v. Jackson_, 26 M.J. 377 (C.M.A. 1988)

and the deleted paragraph no longer accurately describes the current state

of the law. 

### d. Maximum punishment.

The maximum penalty for all offenses under Article 107 has been

 increased to include confinement for 5 years to correspond to 18 U.S.C. &sect;

 1001, the Federal civilian counterpart of Article 107. _See United

 States v. DeAngelo_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 423, 35 C.M.R. 395 (1965). 

## 32. Article 108-Military property of the United States-sale,

 loss, damage, destruction, or wrongful disposition

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 187 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Bernacki_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 641, 33 C.M.R.

173 (1963); _United States v. Harvey_, 6 M.J. 545 (N.C.M.R.

1978); _United States v. Geisler_, 37 C.M.R. 530 (A.B.R. 1966).

The last sentence in subparagraph (c)(1) is based on_ United States

v. Schelin_, 15 M.J. 218 (C.M.A. 1983).

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subparagraph _c_(1) was amended to correct

an ambiguity in the definition of military property. The previous language

"military department" is specifically defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(7)

as consisting of the Department of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Article

1(8), UCMJ, however, defines "military" when used in the Code

as referring to all the armed forces. Use of the term "military department"

inadvertently excluded property owned or used by the Coast Guard. The subparagraph

has been changed to return to the state of the law prior to 1984, as including

the property of all the armed forces. _See United States v. Geisler

_, 37 C.M.R. 530 (A.B.R. 1966); _United States v. Schelin

_, 15 M.J. 218, 220 n.6 (C.M.A. 1983). 

### d. Lesser included offense.

 _See United States v. Mizner_, 49 C.M.R. 26 (A.C.M.R.

1974).

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subparagraph _d_(1) was amended to include a lesser included offense previously

omitted. _See United States v. Rivers_, 3 C.M.R. 564 (A.F.B.R.

1952) and 18 U.S.C. 641. Subparagraphs _d_(2) and (4) were

amended to include lesser included offenses recognizing that destruction

and damage of property which is not proved to be military may be a violation

of Article 109. _See United States v. Suthers_, 22 C.M.R.

787 (A.F.B.R. 1956). 

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishments have been revised. Instead of three levels

 ($50 or less, $50 to $100, and over $100) only two are used. This is simpler

 and conforms more closely to the division between felony and misdemeanor

 penalties contingent on value in property offenses in civilian jurisdictions.

 The punishments are based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1361. The maximum punishment

for selling or wrongfully disposing of a firearm or explosive and for willfully

damaging, destroying, or losing such property or suffering it to be lost,

damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of includes 10 years confinement

regardless of the value of the item. The harm to the military in such cases

is not simply the intrinsic value of the item. Because of their nature, special

accountability and protective measures are employed to protect firearms or

explosives against loss, damage, destruction, sale, and wrongful disposition.

Such property may be a target of theft or other offenses without regard to

its value. Therefore, to protect the Government's special interest in such

property, and the community against improper disposition, such property is

 treated the same as property of a higher value.

 

 _2002 Amendment:_ The monetary amount affecting the maximum punishments

has been revised from $100 to $500 to account for inflation. The last change

was in 1969 raising the amount to $100. The value has also been readjusted

to realign it more closely with the division between felony and misdemeanor

penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _See generally_ American

Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting

$500 as the value). Although the monetary amount affecting punishment in

18 U.S.C. &sect; 1361, Government property or contracts, and 18 U.S.C. &sect; 641, Public money, property or records, was increased from $100 to $1000

pursuant to section 606 of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, P. L. No.

104-294, 110 Stat. 3488 (1996), a value of $500 was chosen to maintain deterrence,

simplicity, and uniformity for the Manual's property offenses. 

## 33. Article 109-Property other than military property of the United

States-waste, spoilage, or destruction

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 188 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Bernacki_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 641, 33 C.M.R.

173 (1963). 

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishments have been revised. Instead of three levels

 ($50 or less, $50 to $100, and over $100), only two are used. This is simpler

 and conforms more closely to the division between felony and misdemeanor

 penalties contingent on value in property offenses in civilian jurisdictions.

 

 _2002 Amendment:_ The monetary amount affecting the maximum punishments

has been revised from $100 to $500 to account for inflation. The last change

was in 1969 raising the amount to $100. The value has also been readjusted

to realign it more closely with the division between felony and misdemeanor

penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _See generally_ American

Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting

$500 as the value). 

### f. Sample specification.

 _See United States v. Collins_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 167,

36 C.M.R. 323 (1966), concerning charging damage to different articles belonging

to different owners, which occurred during a single transaction, as one offense.

## 34. Article 110-Improper hazarding of vessel

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 189 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Adams_, 42 C.M.R. 911 (N.C.M.R. 1970),

 _pet. denied_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 628 (1970); _United States

 v. MacLane_, 32 C.M.R. 732 (C.G.B.R. 1962); _United States

v. Day_, 23 C.M.R. 651 (N.B.R. 1957). 

## 35. Article 111-Drunken or reckless driving

### a. Text.

 _2002 Amendment_: Changes to this Article are contained

in section 581 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year

2002, P.L. 107-107, 115 Stat. 1012 (2001).

 Additionally, this change defines the offense in terms of what alcohol concentration level is prohibited by operation of State law or as otherwise provided.  Also, the text reflects an amendment to section 911 of title 10, United States Code, in section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 to restore the blood alcohol concentration limit that defines the offense of drunken operation of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel in the United States to the limit that existed before the passage of section 581 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002.  Before passage of that Act, an alcohol concentration level in the person's blood or breath of 0.10 grams "or more" of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood (or 210 liters of breath) was a punishable offense.  By relying on the term "blood alcohol content limit," as defined to be the maximum permissible concentration to operate a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel, section 581 resulted in eliminating the level of 0.10 grams as a prohibited level of alcohol concentration and raised the definition of the offense to some level in excess of 0.10 grams.

 _2007 Amendment_:  Changes to this Article are contained in section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, P.L. 108 136, 117 Stat.1392 (2003), and supersede any changes to Paragraph 35 by Executive Order 13387 (14 October 2005).

### b. Elements.

The aggravating element of injury is listed as suggested by sample

 specification number 75 and the Table of Maximum Punishments at 25-13

and A6-13 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The wording leaves it possible to plead

and prove that the_ accused_ was injured as a result of the

 accused's drunken driving and so make available the higher maximum punishment.

 This result recognizes the interest of society in the accused's resulting

 unavailability or impairment for duty and the costs of medical treatment.

 Paragraph 190 (Proof, (c)) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) used "victim,"

the ambiguity of which might have implied that injury to the accused would

not aggravate the maximum punishment. _Analysis of Contents, Manual

for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised Edition)_ DA PAM

 27-2, at 28-10, does not suggest that the drafters intended such

a result.

 _2007 Amendment_:  Paragraph b(2)(c) is amended for consistency with the changes in statutory text contained in section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, P.L. 108 136, 117 Stat. 1392 (2003), and supersedes any changes to Paragraph 35 by Executive Order 13387 (14 October 2005).

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 190 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 _See also United States v. Bull_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 635, 14 C.M.R.

53 (1954) (drunkenness); _United States v. Eagleson_, 3 U.S.C.M.A.

 685, 14 C.M.R. 103 (1954) (reckless); _United States v. Grossman_,

2 U.S.C.M.A. 406, 9 C.M.R. 36 (1953) (separate offenses).

 _1991 Amendment:_ The order of the last and penultimate phrases was

reversed to clarify that "so as to cause the particular vehicle to

move" modifies only "the manipulation of its controls"

and not the "setting of its motive power in action." This change

makes clear that merely starting the engine, without movement of the vehicle,

is included within the definition of "operating." 

### e. Maximum Punishment.

The maximum authorized confinement for drunk driving resulting in

 injury was increased from 1 year to 18 months. This increase reflects the

same concern for the seriousness of the misconduct as that which has, by

current reports, motivated almost half the states to provide more stringent

responses. 

 _1986 Amendment:_ Subparagraphs b(2),

c(3), and f were amended to implement the amendment to Article 111 contained

in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, tit. III, &sect; 3055, Pub.L.

No. 99-570, enacted 27 October 1986, proscribing driving while impaired

by a substance described in Article 112a(b). This amendment codifies prior

 interpretation of the scope of Article 111, as previously implemented in

 paragraph 35c(3). 

 _1995 Amendment:_ This paragraph

was amended pursuant to the changes to Article 111 included in the National

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-484,

106 Stat. 2315, 2506 (1992). New subparagraphs c(2) and (3) were added

to include vessels and aircraft, respectively. Paragraph 35 was also amended

to make punishable actual physical control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel

while drunk or impaired, or in a reckless fashion, or while one's blood or

breath alcohol concentration is in violation of the described per se standard.

A new subparagraph c(5) was added to define the concept of actual physical

control.  This change allows drunk or impaired individuals who demonstrate

the capability and power to operate a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel to be

apprehended if in the vehicle, aircraft, or vessel, but not actually operating

it at the time. 

 The amendment also clarifies that culpability

extends to the person operating or exercising actual physical control through

the agency of another (_e.g._, the captain of a ship giving

orders to a helmsman). The amendment also provides a blood/alcohol blood/breath

 concentration of 0.10 or greater as a per se standard for illegal intoxication.

 The change will not, however, preclude prosecution where no chemical test

is taken or even where the results of the chemical tests are below the statutory

 limits, where other evidence of intoxication is available. _See United

 States v. Gholson_, 319 F. Supp. 499 (E.D. Va. 1970). 

 A

new paragraph c(9) was added to clarify that in order to show that the accused

caused personal injury, the government must prove proximate causation and

not merely cause-in-fact. _Accord United States v. Lingenfelter

_, 30 M.J. 302 (C.M.A. 1990). The definition of "proximate

cause" is based on_ United States v. Romero_, 1 M.J.

227, 230 (C.M.A. 1975). Previous subparagraph c(2) is renumbered c(4).

Previous subparagraphs c(3)-c(5) are renumbered c(6)-c(8), respectively,

and previous subparagraph c(6) is renumbered c(10). 

 Subparagraphs

d(1) and (2) are redesignated d(2)(b) and d(2)(c).  The new d(2)(a) adds

Article 110 (improper hazarding of a vessel) as a lesser included offense

of drunken operation or actual physical control of a vessel. 

 The

new d(1) adds Article 110 (improper hazarding of a vessel) as a lesser included

offense of reckless or wanton or impaired operation or physical control of

a vessel. 

## 36. Article 112-Drunk on duty

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 191 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

 discussion of defenses is based on _United States v. Gossett_,

 14 U.S.C.M.A. 305, 34 C.M.R. 85 (1963); _United States v. Burroughs

_, 37 C.M.R. 775 (C.G.B.R. 1966). 

## 37. Article 112a-Wrongful use, possession, etc., of controlled

substances

 _Introduction._ This paragraph is based on

 Article 112a (_see_ Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No.

 98-209, &sect; 8, 97 Stat. 1393 (1983)), and on paragraphs 127

and 213, and Appendix 6c of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), as amended by Exec. Order No.

12383 (Sep. 23, 1982). Paragraphs 127 and 213 and Appendix 6c of MCM, 1969

(Rev.) are consistent with Article 112a. _See_ S.Rep. No.

53, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 29 (1983). 

 The only changes made by

Article 112a in the former Manual paragraphs are: elimination of the third

element under Article 134; substitution of barbituric acid for phenobarbital

and secobarbital (these are still specifically listed in subparagraph c),

and inclusion of importation and exportation of controlled substances. The

definition of "customs territory of the United States" is based

on 21 U.S.C. &sect; 951(a)(2) and on general headnote 2 to the Tariff

Schedules of the United States. _See_ 21 U.S.C. &sect; 1202. _

 See also_ H.R.Rep. No. 91-1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 74 (1970).

 The maximum punishments for importing or exporting a controlled substance

are based generally on 21 U.S.C. &sect; 960. _See also_ 21

 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 951-53. 

 The definition of "missile

launch facility" has been added to clarify that the term includes not

only the actual situs of the missile, but those places directly integral

to the launch of the missile. 

 The following is an analysis of

Exec. Order No. 12383 (Sep. 23,1982): 

 Section 1 (now subparagraph

e) amends paragraph 127_c_, Section A of the MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

This amendment of the Table of Maximum Punishments provides a completely

revised system of punishments for contraband drug offenses under Article

134. The punishments under 21 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 841 and 844 were

used as a benchmark for punishments in this paragraph. Thus, the maximum

penalty for distribution or possession with intent to distribute certain

Schedule I substances under 21 U.S.C. &sect; 841-15 years

imprisonment-is the same as the highest maximum punishment under paragraph 127_c_ (except when the escalator clause is triggered, _see_ analysis

of section 2_ infra._) 

 Within the range under

the 15 year maximum, the penalties under paragraph 127_c_ are

generally somewhat more severe than those under 21 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 841

and 844. This is because in the military _any_ drug offense

is serious because of high potential for adversely affecting readiness and

mission performance. _See generally Schlesinger v. Councilman_,

420 U.S. 738, 760 n.34 (1975); _United States v. Trottier_,

9 M.J. 337 (C.M.A. 1980). The availability of contraband drugs, especially

in some overseas locations, the ambivalence toward and even acceptance of

drug usage in some segments of society, especially among young people, and

the insidious nature of drug offenses all require that deterrence play a

substantial part in the effort to prevent drug abuse by servicemembers. 

 The

following sentence enhancement provisions in the United States Code were

not adopted: (1) the recidivism provisions in 21 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 841(b),

844(a), and 845(b), which either double or triple the otherwise prescribed

maximum penalty; and (2) the provision in 21 U.S.C. &sect; 845(a)

which doubles the maximum penalty for distribution of a controlled substance

to a person under the age of 21. (The latter provision would probably apply

to a high percentage of distribution offenses in the armed forces, given

the high proportion of persons in this age group in the armed forces.) These

special provisions were not adopted in favor of a simpler, more uniform punishment

system. The overall result is an absence of the higher punishment extremes

of the Federal system, while some of the offenses treated more leniently

in the lower end of the scale in the Federal system are subject to potentially

higher punishments in the military, for the reasons stated in the preceding

paragraph. There are no mandatory minimum sentences for any drug offense. _

See_ Article 56. 

 The expungement procedure in 21 U.S.C.

&sect; 844(b) and (c) is unnecessary and inappropriate for military

practice. Alternatives to prosecution for drug offenses already exist. _

See, e.g._, Article 15. The use of such alternatives is properly

a command prerogative. 

 Section 2 (now the last paragraph of subparagraph

e) amends paragraph 127c Section B by adding an escalator clause to provide

for certain special situations, unique to the military, in which drug involvement

presents an even greater danger than normal. _See_ 37 U.S.C.

 &sect; 310 concerning hostile fire pay zones. 

 Section

3 (now subparagraphs b and c) amends paragraph 213, dealing with certain

offenses under Article 134. Paragraph 213_g_ replaces the

discussion of offenses involving some contraband drugs which was found in

the last paragraph of paragraph 213_b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

It was considered necessary to treat drug offenses more extensively in the

Manual for Court-Martial because of the significant incidence of drug offenses

in the military and because of the serious effect such offenses have in the

military environment. It was also necessary to provide a comprehensive treatment

of drugs, with a complete set of maximum punishments, in order to eliminate

the confusion, disruption, and disparate treatment of some drug offenses

among the services in the wake of _ United States v. Courtney_,

1 M.J. 438 (C.M.A. 1976); _United States v. Jackson_, 3 M.J.

101 (C.M.A. 1977); _United States v. Hoesing_, 5 M.J. 355

(C.M.A. 1978); _United States v. Guilbault_, 6 M.J. 20 (C.M.A.

1978); _United States v. Thurman_, 7 M.J. 26 (C.M.A. 1979).

### (1) Controlled substance.

The list of drugs specifically punishable under Article 134 has

been expanded to cover the substances which are, according to studies, most

 prevalent in the military community. _See, e.g._, M. Burt,

 _et al. Highlights from the Worldwide Survey of Nonmedical Drug Use

and Alcohol Use Among Military Personnel: 1980_. In addition, the

 controlled substances which are listed in Schedules I through V of the Comprehensive

Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (codified at 21 U.S.C. &sect; 801 _

et seq._) as amended are incorporated. The most commonly abused drugs

are listed separately so that it will be unnecessary to refer to the controlled

substances list, as modified by the Attorney General in the Code of Federal

Regulations, in most cases. Most commanders and some legal offices do not

have ready access to such authorities. 

### (2) Possess.

The definition of possession is based upon _United States

v. Aloyian_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 333, 36 C.M.R. 489 (1966) and paragraph

 4-144, _Military Judges' Benchbook_, DA PAM 27-9

 (May 1982). _See also United States v. Wilson_, 7 M.J. 290

(C.M.A. 1979) and cases cited therein concerning the concept of constructive

possession. With respect to the inferences described in this subparagraph

and subparagraph (5) _Wrongfulness, see United States v. Alvarez_,

10 U.S.C.M.A. 24, 27 C.M.R. 98 (1958); _United States v. Nabors_,

10 U.S.C.M.A. 27, 27 C.M.R. 101 (1958). It is important to bear in mind that

distinction between inferences and presumptions. _See United States

v. Mahan_, 1 M.J. 303 (C.M.R. 1976). _See also United States

v. Baylor_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 502, 37 C.M.R. 122 (1967). 

### (3) Distribute.

This subparagraph is based on 21 U.S.C. &sect; 802(8) and

 (11). _See also_ E. Devitt and C. Blackmar, 2 _Federal

 Jury Practice and Instructions_, &sect; 58.03 (3d ed. 1977). 

 "Distribution"

replaces "sale" and "transfer." This conforms with

Federal practice, _ see_ 21 U.S.C. &sect; 841(a), and

will simplify military practice by reducing pleading, proof, and associated

multiplicity problems in drug offenses. _See, e.g., United States

v. Long_, 7 M.J. 342 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Maginley

_, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 445, 32 C.M.R. 445 (1963). Evidence of sale is not

necessary to prove the offense of distributing a controlled substance. _

See United States v. Snow_, 537 F.2d 1166 (4th Cir. 1976); _

United States v. Johnson_, 481 F.2d 645 (5th Cir. 1973). Thus, the

defense of "agency", _ see United States v. Fruscella_,

21 U.S.C.M.A. 26, 44 C.M.R. 80 (1971), no longer applies in the military. _

Cf. United States v. Snow, supra; United States v. Pruitt_, 487 F.2d

1241 (8th Cir. 1973); _United States v. Johnson, supra_ ("procuring

agent" defense abolished under 21 U.S.C. &sect; 801 _

et seq._). Evidence of sale is admissible, of course, on the merits

as "part and parcel" of the criminal transaction (_see

United States v. Stokes_, 12 M.J. 229 (C.M.A. 1982); _cf.

United States v. Johnson, supra; see also_ Mil. R. Evid. 404(b)),

or in aggravation (_see_ paragraph 75_b_(4)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _see also United States v. Vickers_, 13

 M.J. 403 (C.M.A. 1982)). 

### (4) Manufacture.

This definition is taken from 21 U.S.C. &sect; 802(14). The

 exception in 21 U.S.C. &sect; 802(14) is covered in subparagraph (5).

### (5) Wrongfulness.

This subparagraph is based on the last paragraph of paragraph 213_b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _Cf._ 21 U.S.C. &sect; 822(c). _

See also United States v. West_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 3, 34 C.M.R. 449 (1964);

paragraphs 4-144 and 145, Military Judges' Benchbook, DA PAM 27-9

(May 1982). It is not intended to perpetuate the holding in _United

States v. Rowe_, 11 M.J. 11 (C.M.A. 1981). 

### (6) Intent to distribute.

This subparagraph parallels Federal law which allows for increased

 punishment for drug offenses with an intent to distribute. 21 U.S.C. &sect;841(a)(1).

The discussion of circumstances from which an inference of intent to distribute

may be inferred is based on numerous Federal cases. _See, e.g., United

States v. Grayson_, 625 F.2d 66 (5th Cir. 1980); _United States

v. Hill_, 589 F.2d 1344 (8th Cir. 1979), _cert. denied_,

442 U.S. 919 (1979); _United States v. Ramirez-Rodriquez_,

552 F.2d 883 (9th Cir. 1977); _United States v. Blake_, 484

F.2d 50 (8th Cir. 1973); _cert. denied_, 417 U.S. 949 (1974). _

Cf. United States v. Mather_, 465 F.2d 1035 (5th Cir.1972), _

cert. denied_, 409 U.S. 1085 (1972). Possession of a large amount

of drugs may permit an inference but does not create a presumption of intent

to distribute. _See Turner v. United States_, 396 U.S. 398

(1970); _United States v. Mahan_, 1 M.J. 303 (C.M.A. 1976).

### (7) Certain amount.

This subparagraph is based on _United States v. Alvarez

_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 24, 27 C.M.R. 98 (1958); _United States v.

Brown_, 45 C.M.R. 416 (A.C.M.R. 1972); _United States v. Burns

_, 37 C.M.R. 942 (A.F.B.R. 1967); _United States v. Owens

_, 36 C.M.R. 909 (A.B.R. 1966). 

 _1993 Amendment.

_ Paragraph_ c_ was amended by adding new paragraphs

(10) and (11). Subparagraph (10) defines the term "use" and delineates

knowledge of the presence of the controlled substance as a required component

of the offense. _See United States v. Mance_, 26 M.J. 244

(C.M.A. 1988). The validity of a permissive inference of knowledge is recognized. _

See United States v. Ford_, 23 M.J. 331 (C.M.A. 1987); _United

States v. Harper_, 22 M.J. 157 (C.M.A. 1986). Subparagraph (11) precludes

an accused from relying upon lack of actual knowledge when such accused has

 purposefully avoided knowledge of the presence or identity of controlled

 substances. _See United States v. Mance, supra_, (Cox, J.,

 concurring). When an accused deliberately avoids knowing the truth concerning

a crucial fact (i.e., presence or identity) and there is a high probability

that the crucial fact does exist, the accused is held accountable to the

same extent as one who has actual knowledge. _See United States v.

Newman_, 14 M.J. 474 (C.M.A. 1983). Subsection (11) follows federal

authority which equates actual knowledge with deliberate ignorance. _

See United States v. Ramsey_, 785 F.2d 184 (7th Cir. 1986), _

cert. denied_, 476 U.S. 1186 (1986). 

 Section 4 (now subparagraph

f) amends Appendix 6c. The new sample specifications are based on sample

specifications 144 through 146 found in Appendix 6c of the MCM, 1969 (Rev.),

as modified to reflect the new comprehensive drug offense provision. 

 Section

5 provides an effective date for the new amendments. 

 Section 6

requires the Secretary of Defense to transmit these amendments to Congress.

## 38. Article 113-Misbehavior of sentinel or lookout

### c. Explanation.

Subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) are based on paragraph 192 of MCM,

 1969 (Rev.). Subparagraph (4) is based on _United States v. Seeser

_, 5 U.S.C.M.A. 472, 18 C.M.R. 96 (1955); paragraph 192 of MCM, 1969

(Rev.); paragraph 174 of MCM (Army), 1949; paragraph 174 of MCM (AF), 1949.

Subparagraph (6) is based on_ United States v. Williams_,

4 U.S.C.M.A. 69, 15 C.M.R. 69 (1954); _ United States v. Cook_,

31 C.M.R. 550 (A.F.B.R. 1961). _See also United States v. Getman_,

2 M.J. 279 (A.F.C.M.R. 1976). 

## 39. Article 114-Duelling

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 193 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

 explanation of conniving at fighting a duel was modified to reflect the

requirement for actual knowledge and to more correctly reflect the term connive.

### f. Sample specification.

The sample specification for conniving at fighting a duel was redrafted

to more accurately reflect the nature of the offense. 

## 40. Article 115-Malingering

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 194 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Kisner_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 153, 35 C.M.R. 125

 (1964); _United States v. Mamaluy_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 102, 27

C.M.R. 176 (1959); _United States v. Kersten_, 4 M.J. 657

(A.C.M.R. 1977). 

### d. Lesser included offenses.

 _See United States v. Taylor_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 595,

38 C.M.R. 393 (1968). 

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishments were changed to reflect the greater seriousness

of malingering in war or other combat situations and to add a greater measure

of deterrence in such cases. 

## 41. Article 116-Riot or breach of peace

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 195 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and

 _United States v. Metcalf_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 153, 36 C.M.R. 309

 (1966). The reference to "use of vile or abusive words to another in

a public place" contained in paragraph 195_b_ of MCM,

1969 (Rev.) has been replaced by the language contained in the fourth sentence

of subparagraph (2) since the former language was subject to an overly broad

 application. _See Gooding v. Wilson_, 405 U.S. 518 (1972).

### f. Sample specifications.

Riot- _see United States v. Randolf_, 49 C.M.R.

 336 (N.C.M.R. 1974); _United States v. Brice_, 48 C.M.R. 368

 (N.C.M.R. 1973). 

## 42. Article 117-Provoking speeches or gestures

### c. Explanation.

Subparagraph (1) is based on paragraph 196 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.);

 _United States v. Thompson_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 88, 46 C.M.R. 88

 (1972). _See generally Gooding v. Wilson_, 405 U.S. 518 (1972);

 _United States v. Hughens_, 14 C.M.R. 509 (N.B.R. 1954).

Subparagraph (2) is based on the language of Article 117 and _United

States v. Bowden_, 24 C.M.R. 540 (A.F.B.R. 1957), _pet. denied

_, 24 C.M.R. 311 (1957). _See also United States v. Lacy_,

10 U.S.C.M.A. 164, 27 C.M.R. 238 (1959). 

 _1986 Amendment:

_ The listing of "Article 134- indecent language"

as a lesser included offense of provoking speeches was deleted. _

United States v. Linyear_, 3 M.J. 1027 (N.M.C.M.R. 1977), held that

provoking speeches is actually a lesser included offense of indecent language.

Also, indecent language carries a greater maximum punishment than provoking

speeches, which would be unusual for a lesser offense. 

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment was increased from that set forth in paragraph

 127_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) to more accurately reflect the

 seriousness of the offense. 

## 43. Article 118-Murder

### a. Text.

 _2012 Amendment._  This statute was modified pursuant to section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011, to conform to renamed sexual assault offenses in Article 120 and Article 120b. The changes took effect on 28 June 2012.

### b. Elements.

Element (b) in (3), _Act inherently dangerous to others

_, has been modified based on_ United States v. Hartley_,

16 U.S.C.M.A. 249, 36 C.M.R. 405 (1966).

 _2007 Amendment:_  Paragraph (4) of the text and elements has been amended for consistency with the changes to Article 118 under Section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006.  _See_ subsection (d) of Section 552.

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 197 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subparagraphs

c(2)(b) is based on _United States v. Sechler_, 3 U.S.C.M.A.

363, 12 C.M.R. 119 (1953). As to subparagraph (c)(4)(A), _see United

States v. Vandenack_, 15 M.J. 428 (C.M.A. 1983). Subparagraph c(4)(b)

is based on_ United States v. Stokes_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 65, 19

C.M.R. 191 (1955). 

### d. Lesser included offenses.

As to Article 118(3), _see United States v. Roa_,

12 M.J. 210 (C.M.A. 1982). 

 _1993 Amendment:_ The

listed lesser included offenses of murder under Article 118(3) were changed

to conform to the rationale of_ United States v. Roa_, 12

M.J. 210 (C.M.A. 1982). Inasmuch as Article 118(3) does not require specific

intent, attempted murder, voluntary manslaughter, assault with intent to

murder and assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter are not lesser

included offenses of murder under Article 118(3). 

 _1995

Amendment:_ The word "others" was replaced by the word

"another" in Article 118(3) pursuant to the National Defense

Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-484, 106 Stat.

2315, 2506 (1992). This change addresses the limited language previously

used in Article 118(3) as identified in _United States v. Berg_,

30 M.J. 195 (C.M.A. 1990). 

## 44. Article 119-Manslaughter

### b. Elements.

 _2007 Amendment:_  Paragraph (4) of the elements has been amended for consistency with the changes to Article 118 under Section 552 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006.  _See_ subsection (d) of Section 552.

 _2008 Amendment:_  Notes were included to add an element if the person killed was a child under the age of 16 years.

 _2010 Amendment:_  Paragraph (4) of the elements is corrected to properly reflect the 2007 Amendment, which corrected wording not included in the 2008 Amendment.

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 198 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Moglia_, 3 M.J. 216 (C.M.A. 1977); _

 United States v. Harrison_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 484, 37 C.M.R. 104 (1967);

 _United States v. Redding_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 242, 34 C.M.R. 22

 (1963); _United States v. Fox_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 465, 9 C.M.R.

95 (1953). 

### e. Maximum punishment.

 

 _1994 Amendment._ The amendment to paragraph

44e(1) increased the maximum period of confinement for voluntary manslaughter

to 15 years. The 10-year maximum confinement period was unnecessarily restrictive;

 an egregious case of voluntary manslaughter may warrant confinement in excess

 of ten years.

 

 _1994 Amendment._ The amendment

to paragraph 44e(2) eliminated the anomaly created when the maximum authorized

punishment for a lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter was

greater than the maximum authorized punishment for the offense of involuntary

manslaughter. For example, prior to the amendment, the maximum authorized

punishment for the offense of aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon

was greater than that of involuntary manslaughter. This amendment also facilitates

instructions on lesser included offenses of involuntary manslaughter. _

See United States v. Emmons_, 31 M.J. 108 (C.M.A. 1990).

 _2008 Amendment:_  The maximum confinement for voluntary manslaughter when the person killed was a child under the age of 16 years was increased to 20 years.  The maximum confinement for involuntary manslaughter when the person killed was a child under the age of 16 years was increased to 15 years.

## 44a. Article 119a-Death or injury of an unborn child

### c. Explanation.

 This and is based on Public Law 108-212, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1841 and 10 U.S.C. &sect; 919a (Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004) enacted on 1 April 2004.

### 45. Article 120-Rape and sexual assault generally

 _2012 Amendment_. This paragraph was substantially revised by section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011. Amendments contained in this section took effect on 28 June 2012. Sec. 541(f), P.L. 112-81. On 28 June 2012, a modified paragraph 45, "Rape and sexual assault generally," replaced the 2007 version of paragraph 45, "Rape, sexual assault, and other sexual misconduct." The analysis related to prior versions of Article 120 is located as follows: for offenses committed prior to 1 October 2007, _see_ Appendix 27; for offenses committed during the period 1 October 2007 through 27 June 2012, _see_ Appendix 28.

 The 2012 version of Article 120 revises the 2007 version by removing child sexual offenses and miscellaneous sexual misconduct from the statute (placing them in Articles 120b and 120c, respectively); addressing constitutional problems identified by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; simplifying the statutory scheme of Article 120; and expanding the definition of "sexual act" to make the offense gender neutral.  The FY12 NDAA failed to repeal Article 125, thus criminalizing forcible sodomy offenses under both Article 120 and Article 125. Future legislation will be sought to clarify that forcible sodomy offenses are properly encompassed within Article 120.

 The drafting of changes to Article 120 began shortly after the 2007 amendments became effective based on issues revealed in trials.  The effort was reinforced by the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military (DTFSAMS) recommendations in December 2009 that Article 120 be reviewed because it was cumbersome and confusing and there were problems relating to the constitutionality of the affirmative defense of consent.  In addition, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled that the statutory burden shift to the accused in the 2007 version of Article 120 was unconstitutional and the subsequent burden shift to the government to disprove consent beyond a reasonable doubt once the accused had raised the affirmative defense of consent by a preponderance of the evidence resulted in a legal impossibility.  _United States v. Prather_, 69 M.J. 338 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. Medina_, 69 M.J. 462 (C.A.A.F. 2011).

#### a. Text.

 **Rape:** The offense of rape remains largely unchanged from the 2007 version.  The primary difference in this revision is that rape by force is now rape by "unlawful" force.  The word "unlawful" aligns the definition of force with Assault under Paragraph 54. This simplifies the treatment of the issue of consent.  _See United States v. Neal_, 68 M.J. 289 (C.A.A.F. 2010).  The victim's manifestation of lack of consent is now direct evidence that must be considered by the trier of fact. Also, the word "commits" was substituted for "engages in" a sexual act to remove any suggestion of reciprocal engagement in the act by the victim.

 **Sexual Assault:** The offense is renamed "Sexual Assault" from "Aggravated Sexual Assault" in the 2007 version because the term "aggravated" led to confusion due to the fact that there was no sexual act offense of lesser severity.  The definition of sexual assault by causing bodily harm was clarified to note that any sexual act or contact without consent constitutes bodily harm.  The new sexual assault offense was broadened to include situations when the sexual act was committed upon fraudulent representation that the sexual act was for a medical purpose, or by inducing a belief that the accused was some other person.  This covers "fraud in factum" situations previously covered by the pre-2007 version of Article 120.  _See United States v. Booker_, 25 M.J. 114 (C.M.A. 1987).  The new statute also clarifies previously confusing language from the 2007 version regarding the state of a victim's consciousness by prohibiting a sexual act with a person who the accused knows or reasonably should know is sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise unaware that the sexual act is occurring.

 **Sexual Contact offenses:** Aggravated Sexual Contact and Abusive Sexual Contact remain significantly unchanged from the 2007 version of Article 120 except to substitute "commits" for "engages in" in accordance with the analysis above. Wrongful Sexual Contact is deleted because it is no longer necessary.  Committing a sexual act upon another person by causing bodily harm constitutes Sexual Assault under Article 120(b) if the bodily harm consists of any offensive touching, including the nonconsensual sexual act itself.  Abusive Sexual Contact is intended to cover acts where the sexual _contact_ was committed in the same manner as a sexual _act_. Therefore, if sexual_ contact_ constitutes "bodily harm" (any offensive touching), then it will be considered Abusive Sexual Contact.

 **Defenses:** The new Article 120 removes marriage as a defense to sexual assault offenses and removes the accused's burden with respect to raising a mistake of fact defense, clarifying that the accused may raise any applicable defense under the UCMJ or RCMs.  This allows an accused to raise a mistake of fact defense without the unworkable burden shift as noted in _Prather_.  _See United States v. Johnson_, 54 M.J. 67, 69 (C.A.A.F. 2000) (quoting _United States v. Greaves_, 40 M.J. 432, 433 (C.M.A. 1994) ("as a general matter, consent 'can convert what might otherwise be offense touching into nonoffensive touching' and that 'a reasonable and honest mistake of fact as to consent constitutes an affirmative defense in the nature of legal excuse.'").

 **Definitions:** Definitions from the former Article 120(t) have been renumbered as Article 120(g) and modified.  As modified, the definition of "sexual act" has been broadened to include penetration of the vulva, anus, or mouth by the penis, and penetration of the vulva, anus, or mouth by any other part of the body or by any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade any person or to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.  The definition of "sexual contact" has been broadened to include touching any part of the body with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.  The definition of "bodily harm" has been clarified to explain that offensive touching includes sexual acts or sexual contact without consent.  The definition of "force" was simplified from its previous iteration, and the term "unlawful force" was defined in accordance with the definition for "unlawful force" as it relates to Article 128 contained in the 2010 edition of the Military Judges' Benchbook.

 The 2012 amendments to Article 120 left the definition of "consent" generally unchanged, but simplified the structure of the definition and deleted restrictions regarding the use of consent evidence.  The circular language in the 2007 version of Article 120, which used nearly identical words to explain the interaction of consent and capacity, was deleted.  The treatment of consent was simplified and may be disputed when relevant.  For example, the proposed change makes it clear that sleeping or unconscious persons cannot consent.  In addition, persons subjected to a fraudulent representation of a professional purpose to accomplish the act, or under the belief that the person committing the act is another person, cannot consent because they do not understand to what they are consenting.

Finally, the amended definition of "consent" allows a permissive inference of lack of consent based on the circumstances of the case.

### 45a. Article 120a-Stalking

 _2007 Amendment:_  This and is based on section 551 of the

National  Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163, 6 January 2006.

### 45b. Article 120b-Rape and sexual assault of a child

 _2012 Amendment:_ This paragraph is new and is based on section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 [FY12 NDAA], P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011.

Amendments  contained in  this section  take effect on  28 June 2012.  Sec. 541(f), P.L. 112-81.

 As of 28 June 2012, Article 120b criminalizes sexual offenses against children under the age of 16 which were previously contained in the 2007 version of Article 120.  With several amendments for clarity and to make elements of each offense appropriate for child victims, the 2007 version of Article 120 was amended as follows: former Article 120(b) is now Article 120b.(a); former Article 120(d) was renamed from "Aggravated Sexual Assault of a Child" to "Sexual Assault of a Child" and is now Article 120b.(b); and former Article 120(f) was renamed from "Aggravated Sexual Abuse of a Child" to "Sexual Abuse of a Child" and is now Article 120b.(c). The definitions of prohibited sexual acts, sexual contact, and lewd acts have been broadened to cover all sexual offenses against children currently covered under the 2007 version of Article 120(g), Article 120(i), and Article 120(j).

#### a. Text.

 **Rape of a Child:** The elements of "Rape of a Child" have been simplified from its previous version by eliminating reference to the former Article 120(a); broadening the acts which qualify as rape of a child by revising the elements pertaining to fear, rendering the child unconscious, and administering the child a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance; and broadening the definition of sexual act to include penetration of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration of the anus or mouth by any part of the body or by any object with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade any person or to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.  Furthermore, the defenses of mistake of fact as to age and marriage have been eliminated for cases involving rape of a child.  When force is used with a sexual act upon a child over 12, it is sufficient to qualify as rape of a child.  Therefore, by clarifying that a child under 16 cannot consent as a matter of law, the new Article 120b corrects the aberration of child rape offenses in the 2007 version of Article 120 which placed consent of a child under 16 at issue, and brings child rape offenses in line with long-standing military law regarding rape against a child.

 **Sexual Assault:** The elements of "Sexual Assault of a Child" are nearly identical to elements that appeared in the 2007 version of Article 120(d).  Under Article 120b.(b), an accused will be strictly liable for committing a sexual act upon a child under 16 unless the accused can prove mistake of fact as to age by a preponderance of the evidence.

 **Sexual Abuse:** The new "Sexual Abuse of a Child" offense under Article 120b.(c), which proscribes committing a "lewd act" upon a child, was intended to consolidate the 2007 version of Article 120(f), Article 120(g), Article 120(i), and Article 120(j), by expanding the definition of "lewd act" to include any sexual contact with a child, indecent exposure to a child, communicating indecent language to a child, and committing indecent conduct with or in the presence of a child.  Exposure, communication, and indecent conduct now include offenses committed via any communication technology to encompass offenses committed via the internet (such as exposing oneself to a child by using a webcam), cell phones, and other modern forms of communication.  This change expands the pre-2012 definition of "indecent liberty" which proscribed conduct only if committed in the physical presence of a child.  The defense of mistake of fact as to age is available when the child is over 12 years, which the accused must prove by a preponderance of evidence.

 **Consent:** Subsection (g) explicitly states that lack of consent need not be proven for any sexual offense against a child and that a child may not consent as a matter of law. No change is intended from long-standing military law in this area.

### 45c. Article 120c-Other sexual misconduct

 _2012 Amendment:_ This paragraph is new and is based on section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 [FY12 NDAA], P.L. 112-81, 31 December 2011. This section takes effect on 28 June 2012.  Sec. 541(f), P.L. 112-81. The new Article 120c. encompasses offenses contained in the 2007 version of Article 120(k), Article 120(l), and Article 120(n), and is intended to criminalize non-consensual sexual misconduct that ordinarily subjects an accused to sex offender registration. 

#### a. Text.

 **Indecent Viewing, Visual Recording, or Broadcasting:** This offense clarifies the Indecent Act offense previously covered by the 2007 version of Article 120(k).  The new Article 120c.(a) makes clear that both viewing and recording are offenses and explicitly creates an offense for distribution of any recording made in violation of the statute, which was not clearly prohibited under the 2007 version of Article 120(k).

 **Forcible pandering:** With minor clarifying changes, Article 120c.(b) remains unchanged from the 2007 version of Article 120(l).  Non-forcible pandering and non-forcible prostitution remain offenses under paragraph 97, Part IV.

 **Indecent exposure:** This offense encompasses the offense proscribed by the 2007 version of Article 120(n), and expands it to include situations in which the exposure is indecent - even if committed in a place where it would not be reasonably be expected to be viewed by people other than members of the actor's family or household.

### 46. Article 121-Larceny and wrongful appropriation

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 200 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

 discussion in the fourth and fifth sentences of paragraph 200_a_(4) was deleted as ambiguous and overbroad. The penultimate sentence in subparagraph

c(1)(d) adequately covers the point. C. Torcia, _2 Wharton's Criminal

Law and Procedure_ &sect; 393 (1980); _Hall v. United States

_, 277 Fed. 19 (8th Cir. 1921). As to subparagraph c(1)(c), _

see also United States v. Leslie_, 13 M.J. 170 (C.M.A. 1982). As

to subparagraph c(1)(d)_, see also United States v. Smith_,

14 M.J. 68 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Cunningham_, 14

M.J. 539 (A.C.M.R. 1981). As to subparagraph c(1)(f), _see also United

States v. Kastner_, 17 M.J. 11 (C.M.A. 1983); _United States

v. Eggleton_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 504, 47 C.M.R. 920 (1973); _United

States v. O'Hara_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 167, 33 C.M.R. 379 (1963); _

United States v. Hayes_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 627, 25 C.M.R. 131 (1958).

As to subparagraph c(1)(h)(i), _see also United States v. Malone_,

14 M.J. 563 (N.M.C.M.R. 1982).

 _2002 Amendment:_ Subparagraph c(1)(h)(vi) is new.  It was added to provide guidance on how unauthorized

credit, debit, or electronic transactions should usually be charged. _

See United States v. Duncan_, 30 M.J. 1284, 289 (N.M.C.M.R. 1990)

(citing _United States v. Jones_, 29 C.M.R. 651 (A.B.R. 1960), _pet. denied_, 30 C.M.R. 417 (C.M.A. 1960)) (regarding thefts from ATM machines). Alternative charging theories are also available,

_see United States v. Leslie_, 13 M.J. 170 (C.M.A. 1982); _United

States v. Ragins_, 11 M.J. 42 (C.M.A. 1981); _United States

v. Schaper_, 42 M.J. 737 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1995); and _

United States v. Christy_, 18 M.J. 688 (N.M.C.M.R. 1984). The key

under Article 121 is that the accused wrongfully obtained goods or money

from a person or entity with a superior possessory interest. 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishments have been revised. Instead of three levels

 ($50 or less, $50 to $100, and over $100) only two are used. This is simpler

 and conforms more closely to the division between felony and misdemeanor

 penalties contingent on value in property offenses in civilian jurisdictions.

 The maximum punishment for larceny or wrongful appropriation of a firearm

or explosive includes 5 or 2 years' confinement respectively. This is because,

 regardless of the intrinsic value of such items, the threat to the community

 and disruption of military activities is substantial when such items are

 wrongfully taken. Special accountability and protective measures are taken

with firearms and explosives, and they may be the target of theft regardless

of value. 

 _1986 Amendment:_ The maximum punishments

for larceny were revised as they relate to larceny of military property to

make them consistent with the punishments under Article 108 and paragraph

32e, Part IV, MCM, 1984. Before this amendment, a person who stole military

property faced less punishment than a person who willfully damaged, destroyed,

or disposed of military property. The revised punishments are also consistent

with 18 U.S.C. &sect; 641. 

 _2002 Amendment:_ The

monetary amount affecting the maximum punishments has been revised from $100

to $500 to account for inflation. The last change was in 1969 raising the

amount to $100. The value has also been readjusted to realign it more closely

with the division between felony and misdemeanor penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _

See generally_ American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries

 Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting $500 as the value). Although the monetary

amount effecting punishment in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1361, Government property

or contracts, and 18 U.S.C. &sect; 641, Public money, property or records,

was increased from $100 to $1000 pursuant to section 606 of the Economic

Espionage Act of 1996, P. L. No. 104-294, 110 Stat. 3488 (1996), a value

of $500 was chosen to maintain deterrence, simplicity, and uniformity for

the Manual's property offenses. 

### 47. Article 122-Robbery

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 201 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Chambers_, 12 M.J. 443 (C.M.A. 1982); _

 United States v. Washington_, 12 M.J. 1036 (A.C.M.R. 1982), _

pet. denied_, 14 M.J. 170 (1982). Subparagraph (5) is based on _

United States v. Parker_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 545, 38 C.M.R. 343 (1968).

#### d. Lesser included offenses.

 _See United States v. Calhoun_, 5 U.S.C.M.A. 428,

18 C.M.R. 52 (1955). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The aggravating factor of use of a firearm in the commission of

a robbery, and a higher maximum punishment in such cases, have been added

because of the increased danger when robbery is committed with a firearm

whether or not loaded or operable. _Cf._ 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;

2113 and 2114; _United States v. Shelton_, 465 F.2d 361 (4th

Cir. 1972); _United States v. Thomas_, 455 F.2d 320 (6th Cir.

1972); _ Baker v. United States_, 412 F.2d 1069 (5th Cir. 1969). _

See also_ U.S. Dep't of Justice, _Attorney General's Task

Force on Violent Crime, Final Report_ 29-33 (Aug. 17, 1981).

The 15-year maximum is the same as that for robbery under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2111.

### 48. Article 123-Forgery

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 202 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### 49. Article 123a-Making, drawing, or uttering check, draft, or order

 without sufficient funds

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 202A of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

 language in paragraph 202A using an illegal transaction such as an illegal

 gambling game as an example of "for any other purpose" was eliminated

in subparagraph (7), based on _United States v. Wallace_,

15 U.S.C.M.A. 650, 36 C.M.R. 148 (1966). The statutory inference found in

Article 123a and explained in subparagraph (17) was not meant to preempt

the usual methods of proof of knowledge and intent. _ See_ S.Rep.

No. 659, 87th Cong. 1st Sess. 2 (1961). Subparagraph (18) is based on _

United States v. Callaghan_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 231, 34 C.M.R. 11 (1963). _

See also United States v. Webb_, 46 C.M.R. 1083 (A.C.M.R. 1972).

As to share drafts _see also United States v. Palmer_, 14

M.J. 731 (A.F.C.M.R. 1982); _United States v. Grubbs_, 13

M.J. 594 (A.F.C.M.R. 1982). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for subsection (1) has been revised. Instead

 of three levels ($50 or less, $50 to $100, and over $100) only two are used.

 This is simpler and conforms more closely to the division between felony

and misdemeanor penalties contingent on value in property offenses in civilian

 jurisdiction. 

 _2002 Amendment:_ The monetary amount

affecting the maximum punishments has been revised from $100 to $500 to account

for inflation. The last change was in 1969 raising the amount to $100. The

value has also been readjusted to realign it more closely with the division

between felony and misdemeanor penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _

See generally_ American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries

 Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting $500 as the value). 

#### f. Sample specification.

 _See also United States v. Palmer_ and _

United States v. Grubbs_, both _supra_ (pleading share

drafts; pleading more than one check or draft). 

### 50. Article 124-Maiming

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 203 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subparagraph

c(3) is based on _United States v. Hicks_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 621,

20 C.M.R. 337 (1956). The discussion of intent has been modified to reflect

that some specific intent to injure is necessary. _ United States v.

Hicks, supra._ The third sentence of the third paragraph of paragraph

203 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.), which was based on _ Hicks (see Analysis of

Contents, Manual for Courts-martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition)

_, DA PAM 27-2 at 28-15), was misleading in this regard. _

Contra United States v. Tua_, 4 M.J. 761 (A.C.M.R. 1977), _

pet. denied_, 5 M.J. 91 (1978). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

_2007 Amendment:_  The maximum punishment for the offense of maiming was increased from 7 years confinement to 20 years confinement, consistent with the federal offense of maiming. 18 U.S.C. &sect; 114.

### 51. Article 125-Sodomy

 _2015 Amendment._ Paragraph 51 was amended pursuant to section 1707 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013. Additionally, all applicable references to sodomy throughout the Manual were changed to "forcible sodomy" to reflect the decriminalization of consensual sodomy under the UCMJ.

#### b. Elements.

_2004 Amendment:_ Paragraph 51(b) was amended by

adding two factors pertaining to age based upon the 1994 amendment to paragraph

51(e) that created two distinct categories of sodomy involving a child. _

See also_ concurrent change to R.C.M. 307(c)(3) and accompanying analysis.

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 204 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Fellatio

and cunnilingus are within the scope of Article 125. _See United States

v. Harris_, 8 M.J. 52 (C.M.A. 1979); _United States v. Scoby

_, 5 M.J. 160 (C.M.A. 1978). For a discussion of the possible constitutional

limitations on the application of Article 125 (for example, the sexual activity

of a married couple), _see United States v. Scoby, supra._

#### d. Paragraph 51e.

The Analysis accompanying subparagraph 51e is amended by inserting

 the following at the end thereof: 

 _1994 Amendment._ One

of the objectives of the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;

2241-2245 was to define sexual abuse in gender-neutral terms. Since

the scope of Article 125, UCMJ, accommodates those forms of sexual abuse

other than the rape provided for in Article 120, UCMJ, the maximum punishments

permitted under Article 125 were amended to bring them more in line with

Article 120 and the Act, thus providing sanctions that are generally equivalent

regardless of the victim's gender. Subparagraph e(1) was amended by increasing

the maximum period of confinement from 20 years to life. Subparagraph e(2)

was amended by creating two distinct categories of sodomy involving a child,

one involving children who have attained the age of 12 but are not yet 16,

and the other involving children under the age of 12. The latter is now designated

as subparagraph e(3). The punishment for the former category remains the

same as it was for the original category of children under the age of 16.

This amendment, however, increases the maximum punishment to life when the

victim is under the age of 12 years. 

 _Lesser included offenses._

 _2007 Amendment:_ The former Paragraph 87(1)(b), Article  134 Indecent Acts or Liberties with a Child, has been replaced in its entirety by paragraph 45. The former Paragraph 63(2)(c), Article 134 Assault - Indecent, has been replaced in its entirety by paragraph 45. The former Paragraph 90(3)(a), Article 134 Indecent Acts with Another, has been replaced in its entirety by paragraph 45. Lesser included offenses under Article 120 should be considered depending on the factual circumstances in each case.

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for forcible sodomy was raised in recognition

 of the severity of the offense which is similar to rape in its violation

of personal privacy and dignity. 

#### f. Sample specifications.

_2004 Amendment:_ Paragraph 51(f) was amended to

aid practitioners in charging the two distinct categories of sodomy involving

a child created in 1994. _See also_ concurrent change to R.C.M.

307(c)(3) and accompanying analysis.

### 52. Article 126-Arson

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 205 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See United States v. Acevedo-Velez_, 17 M.J. 1 (C.M.A.1983); _

 United States v. Duke_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 460, 37 C.M.R. 80 (1966); _

United States v. Scott_, 8 M.J. 853 (N.C.M.R. 1980); _ United

States v. Jones_, 2 M.J. 785 (A.C.M.R. 1976). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum period of confinement for simple arson of property of

a value of more than $100 has been reduced from 10 to 5 years. This parallels

18 U.S.C. &sect; 81. The separate punishment for simple arson of property

 of a value of $100 or less has been retained because 18 U.S.C. &sect; 81 does

not cover most personal property. 

 _2002 Amendment:_ The

monetary amount affecting the maximum punishments has been revised from $100

to $500 to account for inflation. The last change was in 1969 raising the

amount to $100. The value has also been readjusted to realign it more closely

with the division between felony and misdemeanor penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _

See generally_ American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries

 Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting $500 as the value). A value of $500 was chosen

 to maintain deterrence, simplicity, and uniformity for the Manual's property

 offenses. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 81, Arson within special maritime and territorial

 jurisdiction, no longer grades the offense on the basis of value. 

### 53. Article 127-Extortion

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 206 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Schmidt_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 57, 36 C.M.R. 213

 (1966); R. Perkins, _Criminal Law_ 373-74 (2d ed. 1969).

 Subparagraph (4) is based on _United States v. McCollum_,

13 M.J. 127 (C.M.A. 1982). 

### 54. Article 128-Assault

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 207 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Vigil_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 474, 13 C.M.R. 30

(1953) (aggravated assault); _United States v. Spearman_,

23 U.S.C.M.A. 31, 48 C.M.R. 405 (1974) (grievous bodily harm). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for (2) Assault consummated by a battery

has been increased because of the range of types of harm which may be caused

by a battery. These may include serious injury, even though unintended or

not caused by a means or force likely to produce grievous bodily harm. The

maximum punishment for (6) Assault upon a sentinel or lookout in the execution

of duty, or upon any person who, in the execution of office, is performing

security police, military police, shore patrol, master at arms, or other

military or civilian law enforcement duties, has been increased based on

18 U.S.C. &sect; 111 and 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1114. The maximum

punishment for aggravated assaults committed with firearms has been increased

based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 924(c). _See also_ U.S. Dep't

of Justice, _Attorney General's Task Force on Violent Crime, Final

Report_ 29-33 (Aug. 17, 1981). Note that the higher maximum

for assault with a dangerous weapon when the weapon is a firearm applies

even if the firearm is used as a bludgeon. This is because the danger injected

is significantly greater when a loaded firearm is used, even as a bludgeon. 

 In

certain situations, this punishment scheme may have the effect of making

intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm a lesser included offense

of assault with a dangerous weapon. For example, if in the course of an assault

with a loaded firearm the accused or a coactor stabs the victim with a knife,

the assault with a dangerous weapon (the firearm) would carry an 8 year maximum

penalty, as opposed to 5 years for the assault intentionally inflicting grievous

bodily harm. In such a case, the specification should be carefully tailored

to describe each facet of the assault. 

 _1998 Amendment:

_ A separate maximum punishment for assault with an unloaded firearm

was created due to the serious nature of the offense. Threatening a person

with an unloaded firearm places the victim of that assault in fear of losing

his or her life. Such a traumatic experience is a far greater injury to

the victim than that sustained in the course of a typical simple assault.

 Therefore, it calls for an increased punishment. 

 _2007 Amendment:_  The maximum punishments for some aggravated assault offenses were established to recognize the increased severity of such offenses when children are the victims.  These maximum punishments are consistent with the maximum punishments of the Article 134 offense of Child Endangerment, established in 2007.

### 55. Article 129-Burglary

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 208 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See also United States v. Klutz_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 20, 25 C.M.R. 282

 (1958). Subparagraph c(2) and (3) have been revised based on R. Perkins,

 _Criminal Law_ 192-193 and 199 (2d ed. 1969). As to

 subparagraph c(2),_ see also_ 13 AM.Jur. 2d _ Burglary

_ &sect; 18 (1964); Annot., 70 A.L.R. 3d 881 (1976). 

#### f. Sample specification.

 _See United States v. Knight_, 15 M.J. 202 (C.M.A.

1983). 

### 56. Article 130-Housebreaking

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 209 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and

 _United States v. Gillin_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 669, 25 C.M.R. 173

 (1958). _See also United States v. Breen_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 658,

36 C.M.R. 156 (1966); _United States v. Hall_, 12 U.S.C.M.A.

374, 30 C.M.R. 374 (1961); _United States v. Taylor_, 12 U.S.C.M.A.

 44, 3O C.M.R. 44 (1960) (all regarding "structure"); _

United States v. Weaver_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 173, 39 C.M.R. 173 (1969)

 ("separate offense");_ United States v. Williams_,

4 U.S.C.M.A. 241, 15 C.M.R. 241 (1954) ("entry"). 

### 57. Article 131-Perjury

#### c. Explanation.

Subparagraph (1) and (2) are based on paragraph 210 of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). In the last sentence of subparagraph (2)(a), the phrase

"unless the witness was forced to answer over a valid claim of privilege" which

 appeared at the end of the fourth paragraph of paragraph 210 of MCM, 1969

 (Rev.) has been deleted based on _United States v. Mandujano_,

 425 U.S. 564 (1976); _Harris v. New York_, 401 U.S. 222 (1971).

 _See also United States v. Armstrong_, 9 M.J. 374 (C.M.A.

1980). Subparagraph (3) is new and is based on Public Law 94-550 of

1976 which amended Article 131 by adding a second clause based on section

1746 of title 28 United States Code, which was also enacted as part of Pub.L.

No. 94-550. 

 _Text of section 1746 of title 28, United

States Code_ 

 &sect; 1746. Unsworn declarations

under penalty of perjury. 

 Whenever, under any law of the United

States or under any rule, regulation, order, or requirement made pursuant

to law, any matter is required or permitted to be supported, evidenced, established,

or proved by the sworn declaration, verification, certificate, statement,

oath, or affidavit, in writing of the person making the same (other than

a deposition, or an oath of office, or an oath required to be taken before

a specified official other than a notary public), such matter may, with like

force and effect, be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the

unsworn declaration, certificate, verification, or statement, in writing

of such person which is subscribed by him, as true under penalty of perjury,

and dated, in substantially the following form: 

(1) If executed without the United States: "I declare (or certify,

 verify, or state) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States

 of America that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). 

 (Signature)" 

(2) If executed within the United States, its territories, possessions,

 or commonwealths: "I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty

 of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). 

 (Signature)" 

 If someone signs a statement under

penalty of perjury outside a judicial proceeding or course of justice, and

Article 107 (false official statement) is not applicable, it may be possible

to use Article 134 (clause 3) (_see_ paragraph 60) to charge

a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1621. 

 _Text of

section 1621 of title 18, United States Code_ 

 &sect; 1621.

Perjury generally 

 Whoever- 

(1) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person,

 in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be

 administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or

that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him

 subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes

 any material which he does not believe to be true; or 

(2) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under

 penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States

 Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not

 believe to be true; is guilty of perjury and shall, except or otherwise

expressly provided by law, be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not

more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement

or subscription is made within or without the United States. 

_

 2004 Amendment:_ Subsection (2)(b) was amended to comply with _

United States v. Gaudin,_ 515 U.S. 506 (1995), which held that when

materiality is a statutory element of an offense, it must be submitted to

the jury for decision. Materiality cannot be removed from the members' consideration

by an interlocutory ruling that a statement is material. _See Gaudin,

_ 515 U.S. at 521 ("It is commonplace for the same mixed question

of law and fact to be assigned to the court for one purpose, and to the jury

for another."); and at 517 ("The prosecution's failure to provide

minimal evidence of materiality, like its failure to provide minimal evidence

of any other element, of course raises a question of 'law' that warrants dismissal.").

#### d. Lesser included offenses.

 

 _1991 Amendment:_ Subparagraph _

d_ was amended by deleting false swearing as a lesser included offense

of perjury. _See United States v. Smith_, 26 C.M.R. 16 (C.M.A.

1958); MCM 1984, Part IV, para. 79c(1). Although closely related to perjury,

the offense of false swearing may be charged separately. 

### 58. Article 132-Frauds against the United States

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 211 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishments have been revised. Instead of three levels

 ($50 or less, $50 to $100, and over $100) only two are used. This is simpler

 and conforms more closely to the division between felony and misdemeanor

 penalties contingent on value in property offenses in civilian jurisdictions. 

 _

2002 Amendment:_ The monetary amount affecting the maximum punishments

has been revised from $100 to $500 to account for inflation. The last change

was in 1969 raising the amount to $100. The value has also been readjusted

to realign it more closely with the division between felony and misdemeanor

penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _See generally_ American

Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting

$500 as the value). 

### 59. Article 133-Conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 212 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _

 See Parker v. Levy_, 417 U.S. 733 (1974) (constitutionality of Article

 133). For a discussion of Article 133, _see United States v. Giordano

_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 163, 35 C.M.R. 135 (1964); Nelson,_ Conduct

Expected of an Officer and a Gentleman: Ambiguity_, 12 A.F.JAG L.Rev.

124 (Spring 1970). As to subparagraph (1), _see_ 1 U.S.C.

&sect; 1; Pub.L. No. 94-106, &sect; 803, 89 Stat. 537-38

(Oct. 7, 1975). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

A maximum punishment is established for the first time in order

to provide guidance and uniformity for Article 133 offenses. 

#### f. Sample specifications.

Some sample specifications for Article 133 in MCM, 1969 (Rev.) were

 deleted solely to economize on space. 

### 60. Article 134-General article

 _Introduction._ Paragraph 60 introduces the

 General Article. Paragraph 61-113 describe and list the maximum punishments

for many offenses under Article 134. These paragraphs are not exclusive. _

See generally Parker v. Levy_, 417 U.S. 733 (1974); _United

States v. Sadinsky_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 563, 34 C.M.R. 343 (1964). 

 Except

as otherwise noted in the Analyses of paragraphs 61-113, the offenses

listed below are based on paragraph 127_c_ (Table of Maximum

Punishments), paragraph 213_f_, and Appendix 6 (sample specifications

126-187) of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Eight offenses previously listed (allowing

prisoner to do unauthorized acts, criminal libel, criminal nuisance, parole

violation, statutory perjury, transporting stolen vehicle in interstate commerce,

unclean accoutrements, and unclean uniform) are not listed here because they

occur so infrequently or because the gravamen of the misconduct is such that

it is more appropriately charged under another provision. 

#### c. Explanation.

Except as noted below, this paragraph is based on paragraph 213_a_ through_ e_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

#### (1) In general.

27 C.M.R. 245 (1959).

 (6)(a) _In general_.

 _2015 Amendment._ In 2012 the Manual was amended to address the changes in practice resulting from the holding in _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). In 2015, the President required that the terminal element be expressly alleged in every Article 134 specification.

 The President ended the historical practice of allowing the terminal element to be inferred from Article 134 specifications, see, e.g. _United States v. Mayo_, 12 M.J. 286 (C.M.A. 1982), and required the terminal element be expressly alleged to provide sufficient notice to the accused and for uniformity and consistency in practice. _See Fosler_, 70 M.J. at 227-28. In general, when drafting specifications, the Government must allege every element, either expressly or by necessary implication. _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)(3). However, in Article 134 specifications, the accused must be given notice as to which clause or clauses he must defend against; therefore, the terminal element may not be inferred from a specification.

 Although a single terminal element is required, there are three theories of liability that would satisfy the terminal element: a disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline (under clause 1); conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces (under clause 2); or a crime or offense not capital (under clause 3). The three clauses are "distinct and separate." _Fosler_, 70 M.J. at 230. A single theory may be alleged, or clauses 1 and 2 may be combined. While it is not prohibited to combine clauses 1, 2, and 3 in one specification, such a combination is not practical.

 When charging both clauses 1 and 2, practitioners are encouraged to use the word "and" to separate the theories in one specification, rather than using the word "or" to separate the theories. Practitioners may also allege two separate specifications. At findings, the Trial Counsel or Military Judge must make certain that the record is clear as to whether the trier of fact found that clause 1, clause 2, or both clauses were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Using the word "and" to separate clauses 1 and 2 in the terminal element allows the trier of fact to except the unproven clause from the specification. This approach forces intellectual rigor in analyzing each clause as distinct and separate. Nothing in this analysis should be read to suggest that a specification connecting the two theories with the disjunctive "or" necessarily fails to give the accused reasonable notice of the charge against him. See United States v. Rauscher, 71 M.J. 225, 226 (C.A.A.F. 2012) (per curiam) (citing _Russell v. United States_, 369 U.S. 749, 765 (1962)).

 _2012 Amendment._ Subparagraph (6)(a) formerly had no analysis. _See_ MCM (2008 Edition).  In 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces held that an Article 134 specification fails to state an offense when it does not expressly or by necessary implication allege at least one of the three terminal elements, i.e., that the alleged conduct was: prejudicial to good order and discipline; service discrediting; or a crime or offense not capital. _See United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012). As a result of Fosler, and in an abundance of caution, practitioners should expressly allege the terminal element in every Article 134 specification. The _Fosler_ Court addressed the historical practice of inferring the terminal elements in Article 134 charges, _see, e.g. United States v. Mayo_, 12 M.J. 286 (C.M.A. 1983), and noted that recent cases have required a greater degree of specificity in charging. _Fosler_, 70 M.J. at 227-8 (citing _Schmuck v. United States_, 489 U.S. 705 (1989)). An accused must be given notice as to which clause or clauses he must defend against, and including the word and figures "Article 134" in a charge does not by itself allege the terminal element expressly or by necessary implication.  _Fosler_, 70 M.J. at 229. It is important for the accused to know whether the offense in question is: a disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline under clause 1, conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces under clause 2, a crime not capital under clause 3, or all three.

_Fosler_, 70 M.J. at 229 (citing _United States v. Medina_, 66 M.J. 21, 26. (C.A.A.F.). _See United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012).  _See also_ paragraph 60c(1)-(4) of Part IV for an explanation of clause 1, 2, and 3 offenses under Article 134.

States v. Rowe, supra; United States v. Hogsett_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 681,

25 C.M.R. 185 (1958).

 _2015 Amendment._ New discussion was added in 2012 to address _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). In 2015, that discussion was removed after paragraph 60 was amended by Executive Order. _See_ analysis under subparagraph c.(6)(a) above.

States v. Mardis_, 6 U.S.C.M.A 624, 20 C.M.R. 340 (1956). 

### 61. Article 134-(Abusing a public animal)

#### c. Explanation.

This new paragraph defines "public animal." 

### 62. Article 134-(Adultery)

#### c. Explanation.

(1) Subparagraph c(2) is based on _United States. v. Snyder

_, 4 C.M.R. 15 (1952); _United States v. Ruiz_, 46

 M.J. 503 (A. F. Ct. Crim. App. 1997); _United States v. Green_,

 39 M.J. 606 (A.C.M.R. 1994); _United States v. Collier_,

36 M.J. 501 (A.F.C.M.R. 1992); _United States v. Perez_, 33

M.J. 1050 (A.C.M.R. 1991); _United States v. Linnear_, 16

M.J. 628 (A.F.C.M.R. 1983); Part IV, paragraph 60c(2)(a) of MCM. Subparagraph

c(3) is based on _United States v. Poole_, 39 M.J. 819 (A.C.M.R.

1994). Subparagraph c(4) is based on _United States v. Fogarty_,

35 M.J. 885 (A.C.M.R. 1992); _Military Judges' Benchbook_,

DA PAM 27-9, paragraph 3-62-1 and 5-11-2 (30 Sep. 1996). _See_ R.C.M.

 916(j) and (l)(1) for a general discussion of mistake of fact and ignorance,

 which cannot be based on a negligent failure to discover the true facts.

(2) When determining whether adulterous acts constitute the offense of adultery under Article 134, commanders should consider the listed factors. The offense of adultery is intended to prohibit extramarital sexual behavior that directly affects the discipline of the armed forces, respect for the chain of command, or maintenance of unit cohesion. The intent of this provision is to limit the crime of adultery to those situations where the negative impact to the unit is real rather than theorized. This provision is not intended, nor should it be inferred, to criminalize sexual practices between two adults with full and mutual consent from each other, but rather, to punish the collateral negative effects of extramarital sexual activity when there exists a genuine nexus between that activity and the efficiency and effectiveness of the armed forces. Cf. _United States v. Marcum_, 60 M.J. 198, 204-08 (C.A.A.F. 2004)(despite constitutionally protected liberty interest in private sexual behavior between consenting adults, military may regulate sexual conduct to the extent it could affect military order and discipline).

 While each commander has discretion to dispose of offenses by members of the command, wholly private and consensual sexual conduct between adults is generally not punishable under this paragraph. The right to engage in such conduct, however, is tempered in a military context by the mission of the military, the need for cohesive teams, and the need for obedience to orders. Cases involving fraternization or other unprofessional relationships may be more appropriately charged under Article 92 or Article 134Fraternization. Cases involving abuse of authority by officers may be more appropriately charged under Article 133.

 Rule for Courts-Martial 306(b) advises commanders to dispose of alleged offenses at  the lowest appropriate level. As the R.C.M. 306(b) discussion states, many factors must be taken into consideration and balanced, including, to the extent practicable, the nature of the offense, any mitigating or extenuating circumstances, any recommendations made by subordinate commanders, the interests of justice, military exigencies, and the effect of the decision on the military member and the command. The goal should be a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair. In the case of officers, also consult the explanation to paragraph 59  of Part IV in  deciding how to dispose of an allegation of adultery.

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Pruitt_, 17

U.S.C.M.A. 438, 38 C.M.R. 236 (1968), concerning the defense of mistake.

### 66. Article 134-(Bribery and graft)

#### c. Explanation.

This is based on _United States v.

Marshall_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 426, 40 C.M.R. 138 (1969); _United

 States v. Alexander_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 346, 12 C.M.R. 102 (1953). _

 See also United States v. Eslow_, 1 M.J. 620 (A.C.M.R. 1975).

_2007 Amendment_:   This to the Manual for Courts-Martial.  Child neglect was recognized in _United States v. Vaughan_,  58 M.J. 29 (C.A.A.F. 2003).  It is based on military custom and regulation as well as a majority of state statutes and captures the essence of child neglect, endangerment, and abuse.

### 68b. Article 134-(Child Pornography)

_2012 Amendment_:  This offense is new to the Manual for Courts-Martial.  It is generally based on 18 U.S.C. &sect;2252A, as well as military custom and regulation. The possession, receipt, distribution and viewing of child pornography has been recognized as an offense under clause 1 or 2 of Article 134, or under clause 3 as an assimilated crime under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2251.  This offense was added by Executive Order 13593, signed 13 December 2011.  See Appendix 25.  This paragraph applies to offenses committed on or after 12 January 2012.

have been modified by replacing "duly" with "by a person

authorized to do so." _See_ Analysis, paragraph 19.

This paragraph is based on _United States v. Herndon_,

 15 U.S.C.M.A. 510, 36 C.M.R. 8 (1965); _United States v. Abeyta_,

12 M.J. 507 (A.C.M.R. 1981); _ United States v. Case_, 37 C.M.R.

606 (A.B.R. 1966). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishments have been revised. Instead of three levels

 ($50 or less, $50 to $100, and over $100) only two are used. This is simpler

 and conforms more closely to the division between felony and misdemeanor

 penalties contingent on value in similar offenses in civilian jurisdictions. 

 _

2002 Amendment:_ The monetary amount affecting the maximum punishments

has been revised from $100 to $500 to account for inflation. The last change

was in 1969 raising the amount to $100. The value has also been readjusted

to realign it more closely with the division between felony and misdemeanor

penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _See generally_ American

Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting

$500 as the value). 

### 79. Article 134-(False swearing)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 213_f_(4) of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Whitaker_, 13

 U.S.C.M.A. 341, 32 C.M.R. 341 (1962); _United States v. McCarthy_,

11 U.S.C.M.A. 758, 29 C.M.R. 574 (1960). 

### 80. Article 134-(Firearm, discharging- through negligence)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on _United States v. Darisse_,

 17 U.S.C.M.A. 29, 37 C.M.R. 293 (1967); _United States v. Barrientes

_, 38 C.M.R. 612 (A.B.R. 1967). The term "carelessness"

was changed to "negligence" because the latter is defined in

paragraph 85c(2). 

### 81. Article 134-(Firearm, discharging-willfully, under such

 circumstances as to endanger human life)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on _United States v. Potter_,

 15 U.S.C.M.A. 271, 35 C.M.R. 243 (1965). 

### 82. Article 134-(Fleeing scene of accident)

#### c. Explanation.

(1) Nature or offense. This paragraph is based on _United

 States v. Seeger_, 2 M.J. 249 (A.F.C.M.R. 1976). 

##### (2) Knowledge.

This paragraph is based on _United States v. Eagleson_,

3 U.S.C.M.A. 685, 14 C.M.R. 103 (1954) (Latimer, J., concurring in the result).

Actual knowledge is an essential element of the offense rather than an affirmative

defense as is current practice. This is because actual knowledge that an

accident has occurred is the point at which the driver's or passenger's responsibilities

begin. _See United States v. Waluski_, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 724, 21

C.M.R. 46 (1956). 

##### (3) Passengers.

 _See United States v. Waluski_, supra. 

### 83. Article 134-(Fraternization)

 _Introduction._ This paragraph to the

 Manual for Courts-Martial, although the offense of fraternization is based

on longstanding custom of the services, as recognized in the sources below.

 Relationships between senior officers and junior officers and between noncommissioned

or petty officers and their subordinates may, under some circumstances, be

prejudicial to good order and discipline. This paragraph is not intended

to preclude prosecution for such offenses. 

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is new and is based on _United States v.

Pitasi_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 601, 44 C.M.R. 31 (1971); _United States

 v. Free_, 14 C.M.R. 466 (N.B.R. 1953). _See also_ W.

 Winthrop, _Military Law and Precedents_ 41, 716 n.44 (2d ed.

 1920 reprint); _Staton v. Froehlke_, 390 F.Supp. 503 (D.D.C.

 1975); _United States v. Lovejoy_, 20 U.S.C.M.A. 18, 42 C.M.R.

 1982); _United States v. Livingston_, 8 C.M.R. 206 (A.B.R.

 1952). _See_ Nelson,_ Conduct Expected of an Officer

and a Gentleman: Ambiguity_, 12 A.F. JAG. L.R. 124 (1970). 

#### d. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for this offense is based on the maximum

 punishment for violation of general orders and regulations, since some forms

of fraternization have also been punished under Article 92. As to dismissal,_

see_ Nelson, _supra_ at 129-130. 

#### f. Sample specification.

 _See United States v. Free, supra._ 

### 84. Article 134-(Gambling with subordinate)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Burgin_, 30 C.M.R. 525 (A.B.R. 1961). 

#### d. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment was increased from that provided in paragraph

 127_c_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) to expressly authorize confinement.

 _Cf._ the second paragraph of paragraph 127_c_(2)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

#### e. Sample specification.

Sample specification 153 in Appendix 6c of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was

 revised to more correctly reflect the elements of the offense. 

### 85. Article 134-(Homicide, negligent)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 213_f_(12)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.); _United States v. Kick_, 7 M.J. 82 (C.M.A.

 1979). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

 

 _1994 Amendment:_ Subparagraph e was

amended to increase the maximum punishment from a bad conduct discharge,

total forfeitures, and confinement for 1 year, to a dishonorable discharge,

total forfeitures, and confinement for 3 years. This eliminated the incongruity

 created by having the maximum punishment for drunken driving resulting in

 injury that does not necessarily involve death exceed that of negligent

homicide where the result must be the death of the victim. 

### 86. Article 134-(Impersonating a commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned,

or petty officer, or an agent or official)

#### b. Elements.

The elements are based on _United States v. Yum_,

10 M.J. 1 (C.M.A. 1980). 

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is new and is based on _United States v.

Demetris_, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 412, 26 C.M.R. 192 (1958); _United

 States v. Messenger_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 21, 6 C.M.R. 21 (1952). 

### 87. Deleted-See Executive Order 13447

Indecent acts or liberties with a child was deleted

pursuant to Executive Order 13447, effective 1 October

2007. _See_ Appendix 27 for the original text.

### Deleted-See Executive Order 13447

88. Indecent exposure was deleted pursuant to Executive

Order 13447, effective 1 October 2007. _See_

Appendix 27 for the original text.

### 89. Article 134-(Indecent language)

 _Introduction._ "Obscene" was

removed from the title because it is synonymous with "indecent."

 _See_ paragraph 90c and Analysis. "Insulting"

was removed from the title based on _United States v. Prince_,

14 M.J. 654 (A.C.M.R. 1982); _United States v. Linyear_, 3

M.J. 1027 (N.C.M.R. 1977). 

 Gender-neutral language has been used

in this paragraph, as well as throughout this Manual. This will eliminate

any question about the intended scope of certain offenses, such as indecent

language, which may have been raised by the use of the masculine pronoun

in MCM, 1969 (Rev.). It is, however, consistent with the construction given

to the former Manual. _See e.g., United States v. Respess_,

7 M.J. 566 (A.C.M.R. 1979). _See generally_ 1 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; ("unless

the context indicates otherwise ... words importing the masculine gender

include the feminine as well ...."). 

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is new and is based on _United States v.

Knowles_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 404, 35 C.M.R. 376 (1965); _United

 States v. Wainwright_, 42 C.M.R. 997 (A.F.C.M.R. 1970). For a general

 discussion of this offense, _see United States v. Linyear supra._

 _

1986 Amendment:_ "Provoking speeches and gestures" was

added as a lesser included offense. _United States v. Linyear_,

3 M.J. 1027 (N.M.C.M.R. 1977). 

 _1995 Amendment:_ The

second sentence is new. It incorporates a test for "indecent language"

adopted by the Court of Military Appeals in_ United States v. French

_, 31 M.J. 57, 60 (C.M.A. 1990). The term "tends reasonably"

is substituted for the term "calculated to" to avoid the misinterpretation

that indecent language is a specific intent offense. 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment in cases other than communication to a child

 under the age of 16 has been reduced. It now parallels that for indecent

 exposure. 

### 90. Deleted-See Executive Order 13447

Indecent acts with another was deleted pursuant to

Executive Order 13447, effective 1 October

2007. _See_ Appendix 27 for the original text.

### 91. Article 134-(Jumping from vessel into the water)

 _Introduction._ This offense is new to the

 Manual for Courts-Martial. It was added to the list of Article 134 offenses

 based on _United States v. Sadinsky_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 563, 34

 C.M.R. 343 (1964). 

### 92. Article 134-(Kidnapping)

 _Introduction._ This to the

 Manual for Courts-Martial. It is based generally on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1201. _

See also Military Judges' Benchbook_, DA PAM 27-9, paragraph

3-190 (May 1982). 

 Kidnapping has been recognized as an offense

under Article 134 under several different theories. Appellate courts in the

military have affirmed convictions for kidnapping in violation of state law,

as applied through the third clause of Article 134 and 18 U.S.C. &sect; 13

(_see_ paragraph 60), _e.g., United States v. Picotte

_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 196, 30 C.M.R. 196 (1961); in violation of Federal

law (18 U.S.C. &sect; 1201) as applied through the third clause of

Article 134, _ e.g., United States v. Perkins_, 6 M.J. 602

(A.C.M.R. 1978); and in violation of the first two clauses of Article 134, _

e.g., United States v. Jackson_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 580, 38 C.M.R. 378

(1968). As a result, there has been some confusion concerning pleading and

proving kidnapping in courts-martial. _See, e.g., United States v.

Smith_, 8 M.J. 522 (A.C.M.R. 1979); _United States v. DiGiulio

_, 7 M.J. 848 (A.C.M.R. 1979); _United States v. Perkins,

supra._ 

 After _United States v. Picotte, supra

_, was decided, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1201 was amended to include

kidnapping within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the

United States. Pub.L. 92-539, &sect; 201, 86 Stat. 1072 (1972).

Consequently, reference to state law through 18 U.S.C. &sect; 13 is

no longer necessary (or authorized) in most cases. _See United States

v. Perkins, supra._ Nevertheless, there remains some uncertainty

concerning kidnapping as an offense in the armed forces, as noted above.

This paragraph should eliminate such uncertainty, as well as any different

treatment of kidnapping in different places. 

#### b. Elements.

The elements are based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1201. The language

 in that statute "for ransom or reward or otherwise" has been

 deleted. This language has been construed to mean that no specific purpose

is  required for kidnapping. _United States v. Healy_, 376

U.S. 75 (1964); _Gooch v. United States_ 297 U.S. 124 (1936); _

 Gawne v. United States_, 409 F.2d 1399 (9th Cir. 1969), _

cert. denied_ 397 U.S. 943 (1970). Instead it is required that the

holding be against the will of the victim. _See Chatwin v. United

States_, 326 U.S. 455 (1946); 2 E. Devitt and C. Blackmar, _

Federal Jury Practice and Instructions_ &sect; 43.09 (1977); _

See also Amsler v. United States_, 381 F.2d 37 (9th Cir. 1967); _

Davidson v. United States_, 312 F.2d 163 (8th Cir. 1963). 

#### c. Explanation.

Subparagraph (1) is based on _United States v. Hoog_,

 504 F.2d 45 (8th Cir. 1974), _cert. denied_, 420 U.S. 961

 (1975). _See also_ 2 E. Devitt and C. Blackmar, _ supra

_ at &sect; 43.05. 

 Subparagraph (2) is based on _

United States v. DeLaMotte_, 434 F.2d 289 (2d Cir. 1970), _

cert. denied_, 401 U.S. 921 (1971); _United States v. Perkins,

supra. See generally_ 1 Am.Jur. 2d _Abduction and Kidnapping

_ &sect; 2 (1962). 

 Subparagraph (3) is based on _

Chatwin v. United States, supra_; 2 E. Devitt and C. Blackmar, _

supra_ at &sect; 43.09. _See also Hall v. United States

_, 587 F.2d 177 (5th Cir.), _cert. denied_, 441 U.S.

961 (1979); _Military Judges' Benchbook, supra_, paragraph

3-190. 

 Subparagraphs (4) and (5) are based on 18 U.S.C.

 &sect; 1201; 2 E. Devitt and C. Blackmar, _supra_

&sect; &sect; 43.05, 43.06, 43.10. _See also United States

 v. Hoog, supra._ The second sentence in subparagraph (4) is also

based on _United States v. Healy, supra. See also United States v.

Smith, supra._ The second sentence in subparagraph (5) is based on _

 United States v. Picotte, supra. See also United States v. Martin_,

4 M.J. 852 (A.C.M.R. 1978). The last sentence in subsection (5) is based

on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1201. A parent taking a child in violation of

a custody decree may violate state law or 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1073. _

 See_ 18 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1073 Historical and Revision Note

(West Supp. 1982). _See also_ paragraph 60_ c_(4).

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment is based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1201.

 _See also United States v. Jackson, supra._ 

### 93. Article 134-(Mail: taking, opening, secreting, destroying, or

 stealing)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Gaudet_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 672, 29 C.M.R. 488 (1960); _United States

 v. Manausa_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 37, 30 C.M.R. 37 (1960). This offense

is not preempted by Article 121. _See United States v. Gaudet, supra.

See also_ paragraph 60. 

### 94. Article 134-(Mails: depositing or causing to be deposited obscene

 matters in)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Holt_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 471, 31 C.M.R. 57 (1961); _United States

v. Linyear_, 3 M.J. 1027 (N.C.M.R. 1977). _See also Hamling

v. United States_, 418 U.S. 87 (1974); _Miller v. California

_, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). 

#### f. Sample specifications.

"Lewd" and "lascivious" were eliminated

 because they are synonymous with "obscene." _See_

Analysis, paragraph 90_c_. 

### 95. Article 134-(Misprision of serious offense)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 213_f_(6) of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The term "serious offense" is substituted for

 "felony" to make clear that concealment of serious military

offenses, as well a serious civilian offenses, is an offense. Subsection (1)

is based on _Black's Law Dictionary_ 902 (5th ed. 1979). _

 See also United States v. Daddano_, 432 F.2d 1119 (7th Cir. 1970);

 _United States v. Perlstein_, 126 F.2d 789 (3d Cir.), _

 cert. denied_, 316 U.S. 678 (1942); 18 U.S.C. &sect; 4. 

### 96. Article 134-(Obstructing justice)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Favors_, 48 C.M.R. 873 (A.C.M.R. 1974). _see also_ 18

U.S.C. &sect; &sect; 1503, 1505, 1510, 1512, 1513; _

United States v. Chodkowski_, 11 M.J. 605 (A.F.C.M.A. 1981). 

#### f. Sample specification.

 

 _1991 Amendment:_ The form specification

was amended by deleting the parentheses encompassing "wrongfully"

as this language is not optional, but is a required component of a legally

 sufficient specification. 

### 96a. Article 134-(Wrongful interference with an adverse administrative

 proceeding)

 _1993 Amendment_: Paragraph 96_a_ and proscribes conduct that obstructs administrative proceedings. _

See generally_ 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1505, Obstruction of proceedings before

departments, agencies, and committees. This paragraph, patterned after paragraph

96, covers obstruction of certain administrative proceedings not currently

covered by the definition of criminal proceeding found in paragraph

96_c_. This paragraph is necessary given the increased number of administrative

actions initiated in each service. 

### 97. Article 134-(Pandering and prostitution)

 _2015 Amendment_. Paragraph 97 was amended to broaden the definition of prostitution and pandering to include all sexual acts, not just sexual intercourse. This amendment included the removal of the language in paragraph 97.c suggesting that engaging in sodomy for money or compensation could be charged under paragraph 51 (Article 125Sodomy). Pursuant to section 1707 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, consensual sodomy is no longer a crime under the UCMJ and Article 125 is not an appropriate charge for the consensual exchange of money for sodomy. The definition of prostitution for this offense differs from the definition of prostitution in Article 120c. Congress provided a broader definition of prostitution when criminalizing forcible pandering.

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Adams_, 18 U.S.C.M.A. 310, 40 C.M.R. 22 (1966); _United State

v. Bohannon_, 20 C.M.R. 870 (A.F.B.R. 1955). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for prostitution is based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1384.

 _2007 Amendment_:  This paragraph has been amended.  The act of compelling another person to engage in an act of prostitution with another person will no longer be punished under paragraph 97 and has been replaced by a new offense under paragraph 45.  _See_ Article 120(l) Forcible Pandering.

 _2005 Amendment_:  b. Elements.  Subparagraph (2) defines the elements of the offense of patronizing a prostitute.  Old subparagraphs (2) and (3) are now (3) and (4) respectively.

### 97a. Article 134-(Parole, Violation of)

 _1998 Amendment_: The addition of paragraph

97a to Part IV, Punitive Articles, makes clear that violation of parole is

an offense under Article 134, UCMJ. Both the 1951 and 1969 Manuals for

Courts-Martial listed the offense in their respective Table of Maximum Punishments.

No explanatory guidance, however, was contained in the discussion of Article

134, UCMJ in the Manual for Courts-Martial. The drafters added paragraph

97a to ensure that an explanation of the offense, to include its elements

and a sample specification, is contained in the Manual for Courts-Martial,

Part IV, Punitive Articles. _See generally United States v. Faist,

_ 41 C.M.R. 720 (ACMR 1970); _United States v. Ford,_

43 C.M.R. 551 (ACMR 1970). 

### 98. Article 134-(Perjury: subornation of)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph. It is based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1622

 which applies to any perjury. _See_ 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1621. _

See generally_ R. Perkins, _Criminal Law_ 466-67

(2d ed. 1969). _See also_ the Analysis, paragraph 57; _

United States v. Doughty_, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 540, 34 C.M.R. 320 (1964)(res

judicata); _United States v. Smith_, 49 C.M.R. 325 (N.C.M.R.

1974) (pleading). 

### 99. Article 134-(Public record: altering, concealing, removing

mutilating, obliterating, or destroying)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on Mil.R.Evid. 803(8), but does

 not exclude certain types of records which are inadmissible under Mil. R.

Evid. 803(8) for policy reasons. _See United States v. Maze_,

21 U.S.C.M.A. 260, 45 C.M.R. 34 (1972) for a discussion of one of these offenses

 in relation to the doctrine of preemption. _See generally_ 18

U.S.C. &sect; 2071. 

#### f. Sample specification.

The specification contained in Appendix 6c, no. 172, from MCM, 1969

 (Rev.) was modified by deleting the word "steal" because this

would be covered by "remove." 

### 100. Article 134-(Quarantine: medical, breaking)

#### b. Elements.

The word "duly" has been deleted from the elements of

 this offense for the same reasons explained in Analysis, paragraph 19. 

#### c. Explanation.

Putting a person "on quarters" or other otherwise excusing

a person from duty because of illness does not of itself constitute a medical

quarantine. 

#### f. Sample specification.

Sample specification no. 173, Appendix 6c of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was

 modified based on the deletion of the word "duly," as explained

in the analysis to paragraph 19. _See_ subparagraph b, above.

### 100a. Article 134-(Reckless endangerment)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Woods_, 28 M.J. 318 (C.M.A. 1989); _see also_ Md. Ann.

 Code art. 27, &sect; 120. The definitions of "reckless"

and "wanton" have been taken from Article 111 (drunken or reckless

 driving). The definition of "likely to produce grievous bodily harm"

has been taken from Article 128 (assault). 

_ 2004

Amendment:_ The sample specification was amended to add the word "wantonly"

to make the sample specification consistent with the elements. The phrase

"serious bodily harm" has been changed to read "grievous

bodily harm" in the sample specification to parallel the language in

the elements. Similarly, in the _Explanation,_ the phrase

"serious injury" was modified to read "grievous bodily harm."

 The format of the sample specification was also modified to follow the format

of other sample specifications in the MCM.

### 101. Article 134-(Requesting commission of an offense)

 _Introduction._ This offense to the

 Manual for Courts-Martial, and is based on _United States v. Benton

_, 7 M.J. 606 (N.C.M.R. 1979), _ pet. denied_, 8 M.J.

227 (1980). 

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on _United States v. Benton, supra.

 See also United States v. Oakley_, 7 U.S.C.M.A. 733, 23 C.M.R. 197

(1957). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment is based on _United States v. Oakley,

 supra._ 

 _1990 Amendment:_ The offense

of "requesting the commission of an offense"" was deleted. Solicitation

of another to commit an offense, whether prosecuted under Article 82 or 134,

UCMJ, is a specific intent offense. _See United States v. Mitchell

_, 15 M.J. 214 (C.M.A. 1983). The preemption doctrine precludes the

creation of a lesser included offense of solicitation which does not require

specific intent. _See United States v. Taylor_, 23 M.J. 314

(C.M.A. 1987). 

### 102. Article 134-(Restriction; breaking)

 _Elements._ The word "duly" has

been deleted from the elements of this offense, for the same reasons explained

in Analysis, paragraph 19. 

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on paragraph 20_b_ ,

126_g_, 131_c_, and 174_b_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Haynes_, 15

U.S.C.M.A. 122, 35 C.M.R. 94 (1964). 

#### f. Sample specification.

Sample specification no. 175, appendix 6c of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was

 modified based on the deletion of the word "duly," as explained

in the analysis of paragraph 19. _See_ subparagraph b, above.

### 103. Article 134-(Seizure: destruction, removal, or disposal of

property to prevent)

 _Introduction._ This offense. It is

based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2232. _See generally United States

v. Gibbons_, 463 F.2d 1201 (3d Cir. 1972); _United States

v. Bernstein_, 287 F.Supp. 84 (S.D. Fla. 1968); _United States

v. Fishel_, 12 M.J. 602 (A.C.M.R. 1981), _pet denied_,

13 M.J. 20. _See also_ the opinion in _United States

v. Gibbons_, 331 F.Supp. 970 (D.Del. 1971). 

#### c. Explanation.

The second sentence is based on_ United States v. Gibbons,

 supra. Cf. United States v. Ferrone_, 438 F.2d 381 (3d Cir.),_

 cert. denied_, 402 U.S. 1008 (1971). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment is based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2232.

### 103a. Article 134-(Self-injury without intent to avoid service)

#### c. Explanation.

 _1995 Amendment:_ This offense is based on paragraph

183_ a_ of MCM, U.S. Army, 1949; _United States v.

Ramsey_, 35 M.J. 733 (A.C.M.R. 1992), _aff'd_, 40

M.J. 71 (C.M.A. 1994); _United States v. Taylor_, 38 C.M.R.

393 (C.M.A. 1968); _ see generally_ TJAGSA Practice Note, _

Confusion About Malingering and Attempted Suicide_, The Army Lawyer,

June 1992, at 38. 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

 _1995 Amendment:_ The maximum punishment for subsection

(1) reflects the serious effect that this offense may have on readiness and

morale.  The maximum punishment reflects the range of the effects of the

injury, both in degree and duration, on the ability of the accused to perform

work, duty, or service. The maximum punishment for subsection (1) is equivalent

to that for offenses of desertion, missing movement through design, and certain

violations of orders. The maximum punishment for subsection (2) is less

than the maximum punishment for the offense of malingering under the same

circumstances because of the absence of the specific intent to avoid work,

duty, or service. The maximum punishment for subsection (2) is equivalent

to that for nonaggravated offenses of desertion, willfully disobeying a superior

commissioned officer, and nonaggravated malingering by intentional self-inflicted

injury. 

#### f. Sample specification.

 _1995 Amendment: See_ appendix 4, paragraph 177

of MCM, U.S. Army, 1949. Since incapacitation to perform duties is not an

element of the offense, language relating to "unfitting himself for

the full performance of military service" from the 1949 MCM has been

omitted. The phrase "willfully injure" has been changed to read

"intentionally injure" to parallel the language contained in

the malingering specification under Article 115. 

### 104. Article 134-(Sentinel or lookout: offenses against or by)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph. _See_ Analysis, paragraph

13 and Analysis, paragraph 38. The definition of "loiter" is

taken from _United States v. Muldrow_, 48 C.M.R. 63, 65n.

1 (A.F.C.M.R. 1973). 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for loitering or wrongfully sitting on post

by a sentinel or lookout was increased because of the potentially serious

 consequences of such misconduct. _Cf._ Article 113. 

### 105. Article 134-(Soliciting another to commit an offense)

#### b. Elements.

 _See United States v. Mitchell_, 15 M.J. 214 (C.M.A.

1983); the Analysis, paragraph 6. _See also_ paragraph 101.

#### c. Explanation.

 _See_ the Analysis, paragraph 6. 

#### d. Lesser included offenses.

 _See United States v. Benton_, 7 M.J. 606 (N.C.M.R.

1979), _pet. denied_, 8 M.J. 227 (1980). 

 _1990 Amendment:

_ Listing of "Article 134 - Requesting another to commit

an offense, wrongful communication of language" as a lesser included

offense of soliciting another to commit an offense was deleted in conjunction

with the deletion of such a request as a substantive offense. _See

United States v. Taylor_, 23 M.J. 314 (C.M.A. 1987); and, the Analysis,

paragraph 101. 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

 _See United States v. Benton, supra._ 

 _1986 Amendment:_ The Committee considered maximum imprisonment

for 5 years inappropriate for the offense of solicitation to commit espionage

under new Article 106a. A maximum punishment authorizing imprisonment for

life is more consistent with the serious nature of the offense of espionage.

### 106. Article 134-(Stolen property: knowingly receiving, buying,

concealing)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 213_f_(14)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). and _United States v. Cartwright_, 13

M.J. 174 (C.M.A. 1982); _United States v. Ford_, 12 U.S.C.M.A.

3, 30 C.M.R. 3 (1960). _See United States v. Rokoski_, 30

C.M.R. 433 (A.B.R. 1960) concerning knowledge. _See also United States

v. Bonavita_, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 407, 45 C.M.R. 181 (1972), concerning

this offense in general. 

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishments have been revised. Instead of three levels

 (less than $50, $50 to $100, and over $100) only two are used. This is simpler

 and conforms more closely to the division between felony and misdemeanor

 penalties contingent on value in property offenses in civilian jurisdictions. 

 _

2002 Amendment:_ The monetary amount affecting the maximum punishments

has been revised from $100 to $500 to account for inflation. The last change

was in 1969 raising the amount to $100. The value has also been readjusted

to realign it more closely with the division between felony and misdemeanor

penalties in civilian jurisdictions. _See generally_ American

Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries Sec. 223.1 (1980) (suggesting

$500 as the value). 

### 107. Article 134-(Straggling)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _Military Judges'

Benchbook_, DA PAM 27-9, paragraph 3-180 (May 1982).

### 108. Article 134-(Testify: wrongful refusal)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Kirsch_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 84, 35 C.M.R. 56 (1964). _See also United

 States v. Quarles_, 50 C.M.R. 514 (N.C.M.R. 1975). 

#### f. Sample specification.

"Duly appointed" which appeared in front of the words

 "board of officers" in sample specification no. 174, Appendix

6 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) was deleted. This is because all of the bodies under

this paragraph must be properly convened or appointed. Summary courts-martial

were expressly added to the sample specification to make clear that this

offense may occur before a summary court-martial. 

### 109. Article 134-(Threat or hoax: bomb)

 _Introduction._ This offense to the

 Manual for Courts-Martial. It is based generally on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 844(e)

and on _Military Judges' Benchbook_, DA PAM 27-9, paragraph

3-189 (May 1982). Bomb hoax has been recognized as an offense under

clause 1 of Article 134. _United States v. Mayo_, 12 M.J.

286 (C.M.R. 1982). 

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on _Military Judges' Benchbook,

supra_ at paragraph 3-189.

 _2005 Amendment_:  This paragraph has been expanded to state the various means by which a threat or hoax is based.  Whereas explosives were the instruments most commonly used in the past, new types of weapons have developed.  Included in the new types of methods by which a threat or hoax is based are: weapons of mass destruction; chemical agents, substances, or weapons; biological agents, substances, or weapons; and hazardous materials.  The definitions used in this amendment are based on the following U.S. Code provisions:  40 U.S.C. &sect; 2302 (weapons of mass destruction); 22 U.S.C. &sect; 6701 (chemical weapons); 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1520a (biological agents); and 49 U.S.C. &sect; 5301 (hazardous material).

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment is based on 18 U.S.C. &sect; 844(e).

 _2005 Amendment_:  This amendment increases the maximum punishment currently permitted under paragraph 109 from five years to ten years.  Ten years is the maximum period of confinement permitted under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 844(e), the U.S. Code section upon which the original paragraph 109 is based.

### 110. Article 134-(Threat, communicating)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 213_f_(10)

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Gilluly_,

13 U.S.C.M.A. 458, 32 C.M.R. 458 (1963); _United States v. Frayer

_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 600, 29 C.M.R. 416 (1960). 

### 111. Article 134-(Unlawful entry)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Breen_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 658, 36 C.M.R. 156 (1966); _United States

 v. Gillin_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 669, 25 C.M.R. 173 (1958); _United

 States v. Love_, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 260, 15 C.M.R. 260 (1954). _

See also United States v. Wickersham_, 14 M.J. 404 (C.M.A. 1983)

(storage area); _United States v. Taylor_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 44,

30 C.M.R. 44 (1960) (aircraft); _United States v. Sutton_,

21 U.S.C.M.A. 344, 45 C.M.R. 118 (1972) (tracked vehicle); _United

States v. Selke_, 4 M.J. 293 (C.M.A. 1978) (summary disposition)

(Cook, J., dissenting). 

### 112. Article 134-(Weapon: concealed, carrying)

#### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Tobin_, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 625, 38 C.M.R. 423 (1968); _United States

 v. Bluel_, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 67, 27 C.M.R. 141 (1958); _United

 States v. Thompson_, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 620, 14 C.M.R. 38 (1954). Subsection

 (3) is based on _United States v. Bishop_, 2 M.J. 741 (A.F.C.M.R.

1977), _pet. denied_, 3 M.J. 184 (1977). 

### 113. Article 134-(Wearing unauthorized insignia, decoration, badge,

 ribbon, device, or lapel button).

#### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment has been increased to include a bad-conduct

 discharge because this offense often involves deception. 

# ANALYSIS OF NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT PROCEDURE

### 1. General

#### c. Purpose.

This paragraph is based on the legislative history of Article 15,

 both as initially enacted and as modified in 1962. _See generally

_ H.R.Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 14-15 (1949); S.Rep.

No. 1911, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. (1962). 

#### d. Policy.

Subparagraph (1) is based on paragraph 129_a_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Subparagraph (2) is based on the last sentence of paragraph

 129_a_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and on service regulations. _

 See, e.g._, AR 27-10, para. 3-4 _b_ (1

Sep. 1982); JAGMAN sec. 0101. _Cf._ Article 37. Subparagraph

(3) is based on the second paragraph 129_b_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

#### e. Minor offenses.

This paragraph is derived from paragraph 128_b_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.), service regulations concerning "minor offenses"

 (_see, e.g._, AR 27-10, para. 3-3_d_

(1 Sep. 1982); AFR 111-9, para. 3_a_(3) (31 Aug. 1979));

 _United States v. Fretwell,_ 11 U.S.C.M.A. 377, 29 C.M.R.

193 (1960). The intent of the paragraph is to provide the commander with

enough latitude to appropriately resolve a disciplinary problem. Thus, in

some instances, the commander may decide that nonjudicial punishment may

be appropriate for an offense that could result in a dishonorable discharge

or confinement for more than 1 year if tried by general court-martial, e.g.,

 failure to obey an order or regulation. On the other hand, the commander

could refer a case to a court-martial that would ordinarily be considered

at nonjudicial punishment, e.g., a short unauthorized absence, for a servicemember

 with a long history of short unauthorized absences, which nonjudicial punishment

has not been successful in correcting. 

#### f. Limitations on nonjudicial punishment.

##### (1) Double punishment prohibited.

This subparagraph is taken from the first paragraph of paragraph

 128_d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). Note that what is prohibited is

 the service of punishment twice. Where nonjudicial punishment is set aside,

this does not necessarily prevent reimposition of punishment and service

of punishment not previously served.

##### (2) Increase in punishment prohibited.

This paragraph is taken from the second paragraph of paragraph

128_d_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

##### (3) Multiple punishment prohibited.

This paragraph is based on the guidance for court-martial offenses,

 found in paragraph 30g and 33_h_ of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

##### (4) Statute of limitations.

This paragraph restates the requirements of Article 43(c) regarding

 nonjudicial punishment. 

##### (5) Civilian courts.

This paragraph is derived from service regulations (_see,

 e.g._, AR 27-10, chap. 4 (1 Sep. 1982)) and is intended to

 preclude the possibility of a servicemember being punished by separate jurisdictions

for the same offense, except in unusual cases. 

#### g. Relationship of nonjudicial punishment to administrative corrective

measures.

This paragraph is derived from paragraph 128_c_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and service regulations. _See, e.g._, AR 27-10,

para. 3-4 (1 Sep. 1982). 

#### h.  

_2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (h) is new.  This subsection was added to clarify that nonjudicial punishment proceedings conducted in a combatant or joint command are to be conducted in accordance with the implementing regulations and procedures of the service of which the accused is a member.

##### i. Effect of errors.

This paragraph is taken from paragraph 130 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

### 2. Who may impose nonjudicial punishment

 This paragraph is taken from paragraph 128_a_ of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.) and service regulations. _See, e.g._, AR

27-10, para. 3-7 (1 Sep. 1982); JAGMAN sec. 0101; AFR 111-9,

para. 3 (31 Aug. 1979). Additional guidance in this area is left to Secretarial

regulation, in accordance with the provisions of Article 15(a).

 _2005 Amendment_:  Subsection (2) was amended to clarify the authority of the commander of a joint command to impose nonjudicial punishment upon service members of the joint command.

### 3. Right to demand trial

 This paragraph is taken from Article 15(a) and paragraph 132

of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). 

### 4. Procedure

 This paragraph is based on paragraph 133 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

 and service regulations. It provides a uniform basic procedure for nonjudicial

 punishment for all the services. Consistent with the purposes of nonjudicial

 punishment (_see_ S.Rep. No. 1911, 87th Cong. 2d Sess. 4 (1962))

 it provides due process protections and is intended to meet the concerns

 expressed in the Memorandum of Secretary of Defense Laird, 11 January 1973.

 _See also United States v. Mack_, 9 M.J. 300, 320-21

 (C.M.A. 1980). The Report of the Task Force on the Administration of Military

 Justice in the Armed Forces, 1972, and GAO Report to the Secretary of Defense,

 _Better Administration of Military Article 15 Punishments for Minor

 Offenses is Needed_, September 2, 1980, were also considered. 

 Note

that there is no right to consult with counsel before deciding whether to

demand trial by court-martial. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary

concerned, the decision whether to permit a member to consult with counsel

is left to the commander. In _United States v. Mack, supra,_ records

of punishments where such opportunity was not afforded (except when the member

was attached to or embarked in a vessel) were held inadmissible in courts-martial. 

 _

1986 Amendment:_ Subparagraph (c)(2) was amended to state clearly

that a servicemember has no absolute right to refuse to appear personally

before the person administering the nonjudicial punishment proceeding. In

addition, Part V was amended throughout to use the term "nonjudicial

punishment authority" in circumstances where the proceeding could be

administered by a commander, officer in charge, or a principal assistant

to a general court-martial convening authority or general or flag officer.

### 5. Punishments

 This paragraph is taken from paragraph 131 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

 Subparagraph b(2)(b)4 is also based on S.Rep. 1911, 87th Cong., 1st Sess.

7 (1962). Subparagraph c(4) is also based on _id._ at 6-7

and _Hearings Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Armed Services_, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1962). Detention of pay was deleted

as a punishment because under current centralized pay systems, detention

of pay is cumbersome, ineffective, and seldom used. The concept of apportionment,

 authorized in Article 15(b) and set forth in paragraph 131_d_ of

MCM, 1969 (Rev.), was eliminated as unnecessary and confusing. Accordingly,

the Table of Equivalent Punishments is no longer necessary. 

 Subparagraph

d, in concert with the elimination of the apportionment concept, will ease

the commanders burden of determining an appropriate punishment and make the

implementation of that punishment more efficient and understandable. 

 _

1987 Amendment:_ Subparagraph e was redesignated as subparagraph

g and new subparagraphs e and f were added to implement the amendments to

Articles 2 and 3, UCMJ, contained in the "Military Justice Amendments

of 1986," tit. VIII, &sect; 804, National Defense Authorization

Act for fiscal year 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-661, 100 Stat. 3905 (1986). 

 _

1990 Amendment:_ Subsection (c)(8) was amended to incorporate the

statutory expansion of jurisdiction over reserve component personnel provided

in the Military Justice Amendments of 1990, tit. XIII, &sect; 1303,

National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1990, Pub. L. 101-189,

103 Stat. 1352 (1989).

 _2007 Amendment_:  Paragraph 5.c.(8) was amended because Hardship Duty Pay (HDP) superseded Foreign Duty Pay (FDP) on 3 February 1999.  HDP is payable to members entitled to basic pay.  The Secretary of Defense has established that HDP will be paid to members (a) for performing specific missions, or (b) when assigned to designated areas.

### 6. Suspension, mitigation, remission, and setting aside

 This paragraph is taken from Article 15, paragraph 134 of

MCM 1969 (Rev.), and service regulations. _See e.g._, AR 27-10,

paras. 3-23 through 3-28 (1 Sep. 1982); JAGMAN sec. 0101; AFR

111-9, para 7 (31 Aug 1979). Subparagraph a dealing with suspension

was expanded to: require a violation of the code during the period of suspension

as a basis for vacation action, and to explain that vacation action is not

in itself nonjudicial punishment and does not preclude the imposition of

nonjudicial punishment for the offenses upon which the vacation action was

based. Subparagraph a(4) provides a procedure for vacation of suspended nonjudicial

punishment. This procedure parallels the procedure found sufficient to make

admissible in courts-martial records of vacation of suspended nonjudicial

punishment. _United States v.  Covington_, 10 M.J. 64 (C.M.A.

1980). 

 _1990 Amendment:_ A new subsection a(4)

was added to permit punishment imposed under Article 15 to be suspended based

on conditions in addition to violations of the UCMJ. This affords the same

 flexibility given to authorities who suspend punishment adjudged at court-martial

under R.C.M. 1108(c). Experience has demonstrated the necessity and utility

of such flexibility in the nonjudicial punishment context. 

### 7. Appeals

 This paragraph is taken from paragraph 135 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.)

 and service regulations dealing with appeals. _See_ AR 27-10,

paras. 3-29 through 3-35 (1 Sep. 1982); JAGMAN 0101; AFR 111-9,

para. 8 (31 Aug. 1981). Subparagraph (d) requires an appeal to be filed

within 5 days or the right to appeal will be waived, absent unusual circumstances.

This is a reduction from the 15 days provided for in paragraph 135 and is

intended to expedite the appeal process. Subparagraph f(2) is intended to

promote sound practice, that is, the superior authority should consider many

factors when reviewing an appeal, and not be limited to matters submitted

by the appellant or the officer imposing the punishment. Subparagraph f(3)

provides for "additional proceedings" should a punishment be

set aside due to a procedural error. This is consistent with court-martial

 practice and intended to ensure that procedural errors do not prevent appropriate

disposition of a disciplinary matter. 

### 8. Records of nonjudicial punishment

 This paragraph is taken from Article 15(g) and paragraph 133c

 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

# THE JOINT SERVICE COMMITTEE ON MILITARY JUSTICE (JSC)

# PUNITIVE ARTICLES APPLICABLE TO SEXUAL OFFENSES COMMITTED PRIOR TO 1 OCTOBER 2007

The punitive articles contained in this appendix were replaced or superseded by changes to Article 120, Uniform Code of Military Justice, contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. Article 120 was amended again by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. Each version of Article 120 is located in a different part of this Manual. For offenses committed prior to 1 October 2007, the relevant sexual offense provisions and analysis are contained in this appendix and listed below. For offenses committed during the period

1 October 2007 through 27 June 2012, the relevant sexual offense provisions and analysis are contained in Appendix 28. For offenses committed on or after 28 June 2012, the relevant sexual offense provisions are contained in Part IV of this Manual (Articles 120, 120b, and 120c).

## 45. Article 120-Rape and carnal knowledge

### a. Text.

(a) Any person subject to this chapter who commits an act of sexual intercourse by force and without consent, is guilty of rape and shall be punished by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.

(b) Any person subject to this chapter who, under circumstances not amounting to rape, commits an act of sexual intercourse with a person-

(1) who is not his or her spouse; and

(2) who has not attained the age of sixteen years, is guilty of carnal knowledge and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.

(c) Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete either of these offenses.

(d)(1) In a prosecution under subsection (b), it is an affirmative defense that-

(A) the person with whom the accused committed the act of sexual intercourse had at the time of the alleged offense attained the age of twelve

years; and

(B) the accused reasonably believed that the person had at the time of the alleged offense attained the age of 16 years.

(2) The accused has the burden of proving a defense under subparagraph (d)(1) by a preponderance of the evidence.

### b. Elements.

#### (1) Rape.

(a) That the accused committed an act of sexual intercourse; and

(b) That the act of sexual intercourse was done by force and without consent.

#### (2) Carnal knowledge.

(a) That the accused committed an act of sexual intercourse with a certain person;

(b) That the person was not the accused's spouse; and

(c)(1) That at the time of the sexual intercourse the person was under the age of 12; or

(2) That at the time of the sexual intercourse the person had attained the age of 12 but was under the age of 16.

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) Rape.

##### (a) Nature of offense.

Rape is sexual intercourse by a person, executed by force and without consent of the victim. It may be committed on a victim of any age. Any penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offense.

##### (b) Force and lack of consent.

Force and lack of consent are necessary to the offense. Thus, if the victim consents to the act, it is not rape. The lack of consent required, however, is more than mere lack of acquiescence. If a victim in possession of his or her mental faculties fails to make lack of consent reasonably manifest by taking such measures of resistance as are called for by the circumstances, the inference may be drawn that the victim did consent. Consent, however, may not be inferred if resistance would have been futile, where resistance is overcome by threats of death or great bodily harm, or where the victim is unable to resist because of the lack of mental or physical faculties. In such a case there is no consent and the force involved in penetration will suffice. All the surrounding circumstances are to be considered in determining whether a victim gave consent, or whether he or she failed or ceased to resist only because of a reasonable fear of death or grievous bodily harm. If there is actual consent, although obtained by fraud, the act is not rape, but if to the accused's knowledge the victim is of unsound mind or unconscious to an extent rendering him or her incapable of giving consent, the act is rape. Likewise, the acquiescence of a child of such tender years that he or she is incapable of understanding the nature of the act is not consent.

##### (c) Character of victim.

_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 412 concerning rules of evidence relating to an alleged rape victim's character.

#### (2) Carnal knowledge.

"Carnal knowledge" is sexual intercourse under circumstances not amounting to rape, with a person who is not the accused's spouse and who has not attained the age of 16 years.  Any penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offense. It is a defense, however, which the accused must prove by a preponderance of the evidence, that at the time of the act of sexual intercourse, the person with whom the accused committed the act of sexual intercourse was at least 12 years of age, and that the accused reasonably believed that this same person was at least 16 years of age.

### d. Lesser included offenses.

#### (1) Rape.

(a) Article 128-assault; assault consummated by a battery

(b) Article 134-assault with intent to commit rape

(c) Article 134-indecent assault

(d) Article 80-attempts

(e) Article 120(b)-carnal knowledge

#### (2) Carnal knowledge.

(a) Article 134-indecent acts or liberties with a person under 16

(b) Article 80-attempts

### e. Maximum punishment.

#### (1) Rape.

Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.

#### (2) Carnal knowledge with a child who, at the time of the offense, has attained the age of 12 years.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances,

## Appendix 23 Analysis Follows:  

[Note: The analysis below was removed from Appendix 23 and pertains to Article 120 and other punitive articles applicable to sexual offenses as they existed prior to the 2007 Amendment. The analysis was inserted into this appendix to accompany the version of Article 120, and other punitive sexual offense articles, applicable to offenses committed before 1 October 2007. For offenses committed during the period 1 October 2007 through 27 June 2012, analysis related to Article 120 is contained in Appendix 27. For offenses committed on or after 28 June 2012, analysis related to Article 120, 120b, and 120c is contained in Appendix 23.]

## 45. Article 120-Rape and carnal knowledge

### b. Elements.

_2004 Amendment:_ Paragraph 45(b)(2) was amended

to add two distinct elements of age based upon the 1994 amendment to paragraph

45(e). See also concurrent change to R.C.M. 307(c)(3) and accompanying analysis.

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 199 of MCM, 1969 (Rev.). The

 third paragraph of paragraph 199(a) was deleted as unnecessary. The third

 paragraph of paragraph 199(b) was deleted based on the preemption doctrine.

 _See United States v. Wright_, 5 M.J. 106 (C.M.A. 1978); _

 United States v. Norris_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 236, 8 C.M.R. 36 (1953). _

 Cf. Williams v. United States_, 327 U.S. 711 (1946) (scope of preemption

doctrine). The Military Rules of Evidence deleted the requirement for corroboration

of the victim's testimony in rape and similar cases under former paragraph

153 _a_ of MCM, 1969. _See_ Analysis, Mil.

R. Evid. 412. 

### d. Lesser included offenses.

Carnal knowledge was deleted as a lesser included offense of rape

in view of the separate elements in each offense. Both should be separately

 pleaded in a proper case. _See generally United States v. Smith_,

7 M.J. 842 (A.C.M.R. 1979).

 _1993 Amendment._ The

amendment to para 45_d_(1) represents an administrative change

to conform the Manual with case authority. Carnal knowledge is a lesser included

offense of rape where the pleading alleges that the victim has not attained

the age of 16 years. _ See United States v. Baker_, 28 M.J.

900 (A.C.M.R. 1989); _ United States v. Stratton_, 12 M.J.

998 (A.F.C.M.R. 1982), _pet. denied_, 15 M.J. 107 (C.M.A.

1983); _United States v. Smith_, 7 M.J. 842 (A.C.M.R. 1979).

### e. Maximum punishment.

 

 _1994 Amendment._ Subparagraph _

e_ was amended by creating two distinct categories of carnal knowledge

for sentencing purposes -- one involving children who had attained the age

of 12 years at the time of the offense, now designated as subparagraph e(2),

and the other for those who were younger than 12 years. The latter is now

designated as subparagraph e(3). The punishment for the older children was

increased from 15 to 20 years confinement. The maximum confinement for carnal

knowledge of a child under 12 years was increased to life. The purpose for

these changes is to bring the punishments more in line with those for sodomy

of a child under paragraph 51e of this part and with the Sexual Abuse Act

of 1986, 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2241-2245. The alignment of

the maximum punishments for carnal knowledge with those of sodomy is aimed

at paralleling the concept of gender-neutrality incorporated into the

Sexual Abuse Act. 

 _1995 Amendment._ The offense

of rape was made gender neutral and the spousal exception was removed under

Article 120(a).  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993,

Pub. L. No. 102-484, 106 Stat. 2315, 2506 (1992). 

 Rape

may "be punished by death" only if constitutionally permissible.

 In _Coker v. Georgia_, 433 U.S. 584 (1977), the Court held

that the death penalty is "grossly disproportionate and excessive punishment

for the rape of an adult woman," and is "therefore forbidden

by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment." _

Id._ at 592 (plurality opinion). _Coker_, however,

leaves open the question of whether it is permissible to impose the death

penalty for the rape of a minor by an adult. _See Coker_,

433 U.S. at 595. _See Leatherwood v. State_, 548 So.2d 389

(Miss. 1989) (death sentence for rape of minor by an adult is not cruel and

unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment). _But see Buford

v. State_, 403 So.2d 943 (Fla. 1981) (sentence of death is grossly

disproportionate for sexual assault of a minor by an adult and consequently

is forbidden by Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment). 

 _

1998 Amendment:_ In enacting section 1113 of the National Defense

Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186,

462 (1996), Congress amended Article 120, UCMJ, to make the offense gender

neutral and create a mistake of fact as to age defense to a prosecution for

carnal knowledge. The accused must prove by a preponderance of the evidence

that the person with whom he or she had sexual intercourse was at least 12

years of age, and that the accused reasonably believed that this person was

at least 16 years of age. 

### f. Sample Specification.

_2004 Amendment:_ Paragraph 45(f)(2) was amended

to aid practitioners in charging the two distinct categories of carnal knowledge

created in 1994. For the same reason paragraph 45(f)(1) was amended to allow

for contingencies of proof because carnal knowledge is a lesser-included offense

of rape if properly pleaded. _ See also_ concurrent change

to R.C.M.307(c)(3) and accompanying analysis.

## 63. Article 134-(Assault-indecent)

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 213_f_(2) of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See United States v. Caillouette_, 12

U.S.C.M.A. 149, 30 C.M.R. 149 (1961) regarding specific intent. _See

 also United States v. Headspeth_, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 635, 10 C.M.R. 133

 (1953). 

 Gender-neutral language has been used in this paragraph,

as well as throughout this Manual. This will eliminate any question about

the intended scope of certain offenses, such as indecent assault such as

may have been raised by the use of the masculine pronoun in MCM, 1969 (Rev.).

It is, however, consistent with the construction given to the former Manual. _

See, e.g., United States v. Respess_, 7 M.J. 566 (A.C.M.R. 1979)._

See generally_ 1 U.S.C. &sect; 1 ("unless the context

indicates otherwise ... words importing the masculine gender include

the feminine as well ...."). 

### d. Lesser included offenses.

 _See United States v. Thacker_, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 408,

37 C.M.R. 28 (1966); _United States v. Jackson_, 31 C.M.R.

738 (A.F.B.R. 1962). 

 _2007 Amendment:_  This paragraph has been replaced in its entirety by paragraph 45. _See_ Article 120 (e) Aggravated Sexual Contact, (h) Abusive Sexual Contact, and (m) Wrongful Sexual Contact.

## 87. Article 134-(Indecent acts or liberties with a child)

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph is based on paragraph 213_f_(3) of

 MCM, 1969 (Rev.). _See also United States v. Knowles_, 15

 U.S.C.M.A. 404, 35 C.M.R. 376 (1965); _United States v. Brown_,

 3 U.S.C.M.A. 454, 13 C.M.R. 454, 13 C.M.R. 10 (1953); _United States

v. Riffe_, 25 C.M.R. 650 (A.B.R. 1957), _pet. denied_,

9 U.S.C.M.A. 813, 25 C.M.R. 486 (1958). "Lewd" and "lascivious"

were deleted because they are synonymous with indecent. _See id. See

also_ paragraph 90c. 

 _2007 Amendment._  This paragraph has been replaced in its entirety by paragraph 45.  _See_ Article 120 (g) Aggravated Sexual Contact with a Child, (i) Abusive Sexual Contact with a Child, and (j) Indecent Liberty with Child.

## 88. Article 134-(Indecent exposure)

### c. Explanation.

This paragraph and is based on _United States v.

Manos_, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 734, 25 C.M.R. 238 (1958). _See also United

 States v. Caune_, 22 U.S.C.M.A. 200, 46 C.M.R. 200 (1973); _

 United States v. Conrad_, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 439, 35 C.M.R. 411 (1965).

### e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment has been increased to include a bad-conduct

 discharge. Indecent exposure in some circumstances (e.g., in front of children,

 but without the intent to incite lust or gratify sexual desires necessary

for indecent acts or liberties) is sufficiently serious to authorize a punitive

 discharge. 

 _2007 Amendment_: This paragraph has been replaced in its entirety by paragraph 45.  _See_ Article 120(n) Indecent Exposure.

## 90. Article 134-(Indecent acts with another)

### c. Explanation.

This and is based on _United States v.

Holland_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 444, 31 C.M.R. 30 (1961); _United States

 v. Gaskin_, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 419, 31 C.M.R. 5 (1962); _United

 States v. Sanchez_, 11 U.S.C.M.A. 216, 29 C.M.R. 32 (1960); _

 United States v. Johnson_, 4 M.J. 770 (A.C.M.R. 1978). "Lewd"

and "lascivious" have been deleted as they are synonymous with

"indecent." _See id._

**  The term "threatening or placing that other person in fear" under paragraph (1)(A) of subsection (c) (aggravated sexual assault), or under subsection (h) (abusive sexual contact), means a communication or action that is of sufficient consequence to cause a reasonable fear that non-compliance will result in the victim or another being subjected to a lesser degree of harm than death, grievous bodily harm, or kidnapping.**

#### (B) **Inclusions.**

**  Such lesser degree of harm includes-**

(i) **physical injury to another person or to another person's property; or**

(ii) **a threat-

     (I) to accuse any person of a crime;

     (II) to expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject some person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule; or

     (III) through the use or abuse of military position, rank, or authority, to affect or threaten to affect, either positively or negatively, the military career of some person.

**

#### (8) **Bodily harm.**

**The term "bodily harm" means any offensive touching of another, however slight.**

##### (9) **Child.**

**The term "child" means any person who has not attained the age of 16 years.**

###### (10) **Lewd act.**

**The term "lewd act" means-**

(A) **the intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia of another person, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, or degrade any person, or to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person; or**

(B) **intentionally causing another person to touch, not through the clothing, the genitalia of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate or degrade any person, or to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.**

##### (11) **Indecent liberty.**

**The term "indecent liberty" means indecent conduct, but physical contact is not required.  It includes one who with the requisite intent exposes one's genitalia, anus, buttocks, or female areola or nipple to a child.  An indecent liberty may consist of communication of indecent language as long as the communication is made in the physical presence of the child.  If words designed to excite sexual desire are spoken to a child, or a child is exposed to or involved in sexual conduct, it is an indecent liberty; the child's consent is not relevant.**

##### (12) **Indecent conduct.**

**The term "indecent conduct" means that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity that is grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, and tends to excite sexual desire or deprave morals with respect to sexual relations.  Indecent conduct includes observing, or making a videotape, photograph, motion picture, print, negative, slide, or other mechanically, electronically, or chemically reproduced visual material, without another person's consent, and contrary to that other person's reasonable expectation of privacy, of-**

(A) **that other person's genitalia, anus, or buttocks, or (if that other person is female) that person's areola or nipple; or**

(B) **that other person while that other person is engaged in a sexual act, sodomy (under section 925 (article 125) of this chapter), or sexual contact.**

#### (13) **Act of prostitution.**

**The term "act of prostitution" means a sexual act, sexual contact, or lewd act for the purpose of receiving money or other compensation.**

#### (14) **Consent.**

**The term "consent" means words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual conduct at issue by a competent person.  An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means there is no consent.  Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the accused's use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute consent.  A current or previous dating relationship by itself or the manner of dress of the person involved with the accused in the sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute consent.  A person cannot consent to sexual activity if-**

(A) **under 16 years of age; or**

(B) **substantially incapable of-**

(i) **appraising the nature of the sexual conduct at issue due to-

     (I) mental impairment or unconsciousness resulting from consumption of alcohol, drugs, a similar substance, or otherwise; or

     (II) mental disease or defect that renders the person unable to understand the nature of the sexual conduct at issue;**

(ii) **physically declining participation in the sexual conduct at issue; or**

(iii) **physically communicating unwillingness to engage in the sexual conduct at issue.**

###### (15) **Mistake of fact as to consent.**

**The term "mistake of fact as to consent" means the accused held, as a result of ignorance or mistake, an incorrect belief that the other person engaging in the sexual conduct consented.  The ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of the accused and must have been reasonable under all the circumstances.  To be reasonable, the ignorance or mistake must have been based on information, or lack of it, that would indicate to a reasonable person that the other person consented.  Additionally, the ignorance or mistake cannot be based on the negligent failure to discover the true facts.  Negligence is the absence of due care.  Due care is what a reasonably careful person would do under the same or similar circumstances.  The accused's state of intoxication, if any, at the time of the offense is not relevant to mistake of fact.  A mistaken belief that the other person consented must be that which a reasonably careful, ordinary, prudent, sober adult would have had under the circumstances at the time of the offense.**

###### (16) **Affirmative defense.**

**The term "affirmative defense" means any special defense that, although not denying that the accused committed the objective acts constituting the offense charged, denies, wholly, or partially, criminal responsibility for those acts.  The accused has the burden of proving the affirmative defense by a preponderance of evidence.  After the defense meets this burden, the prosecution shall have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the affirmative defense did not exist.**

## Appendix 23 Analysis Follows:  

[Note: The analysis below was removed from Appendix 23 and pertains to the 2007 Amendment of Article 120. The analysis was inserted into this appendix to accompany the version of Article 120 applicable to offenses committed during the period 1 October 2007 through 27 June 2012. For offenses committed prior to 1 October 2007, analysis related to Article 120 and other punitive articles applicable to sexual offenses is contained in Appendix 27. For offenses committed on or after 28 June 2012, analysis related to Article 120, 120b, and 120c is contained in Appendix 23.]

## 45. Article 120-Rape, sexual assault, and other sexual misconduct

 _2007 Amendment:_  Changes to this paragraph are contained in

Div. A. Title V. Subtitle E, Section 552(a)(1) of the National

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, P.L. 109-163,

119 Stat. 3257 (6 January 2006), which supersedes the previous

paragraph 45, Rape and Carnal Knowledge, in its entirety and

replaces paragraph 45 with Rape, sexual assault and other sexual

misconduct. In accordance with Section 552(c) of that Act, the

amendment to the Article applies only with respect to offenses

committed on or after 1 October 2007.

  Nothing in these amendments invalidates any nonjudicial punishment

proceeding, restraint, investigation, referral of charges,

trial in which arraignment occurred, or other action begun prior to

1 October 2007. Any such nonjudical punishment proceeding,

restraint, investigation, referral of charges, trial in which arraignment

occurred, or other action may proceed in the same manner

and with the same effect as if these amendments had not been

prescribed.

  This new Article 120 consolidates several sexual misconduct

offenses and is generally based on the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986,

18 U.S.C. Sections 2241-2245. The following is a list of offenses

that have been replaced by this new paragraph 45:

  (1) Paragraph 63, 134 Assault - Indecent, has been replaced in

its entirety by three new offenses under paragraph 45. _See_ subsections

(e) Aggravated Sexual Contact, (h) Abusive Sexual Contact,

and (m) Wrongful Sexual Contact.

  (2) Paragraph 87, 134 Indecent Acts or Liberties with a Child,

has been replaced in its entirety by three new offenses under

paragraph 45. _See_ subsections (g) Aggravated Sexual Contact

with a Child, (i) Abusive Sexual Contact with a Child, and (j)

Indecent Liberty with a Child.

  (3) Paragraph 88, Article 134 Indecent Exposure, has been

replaced in its entirety by a new offense under paragraph 45. _See_

subsection (n) Indecent Exposure.

  (4) Paragraph 90, Article 134 Indecent Acts with Another, has

been replaced in its entirety by a new offense under

paragraph 45. _See_ subsection (k) Indecent Act.

  (5) Paragraph 97, Article 134 Pandering and Prostitution, has

been amended. The act of compelling another person to engage in

an act of prostitution with another person will no longer be an

offense under paragraph 97 and has been replaced by a new

offense under paragraph 45. _See_ subsection (l), Forcible

Pandering.

c. _Explanation._ Subparagraph (3), definition of "indecent," is

taken from paragraphs 89.c and 90.c of the Manual (2005 ed.)

and is intended to consolidate the definitions of "indecent," as

used in the former offenses under Article 134 of "Indecent acts or

liberties with a child," "Indecent exposure," and "Indecent acts

with another," formerly at paragraphs 87, 88, and 90 of the 2005

Manual, and "Indecent language," at paragraph 89. The application

of this single definition of "indecent" to the offenses of

"Indecent liberty with a child," "Indecent act," and "Indecent

exposure" under Article 120 is consistent with the construction

given to the former Article 134 offenses in the 2005 Manual that

were consolidated into Article 120. _See e.g. United States v.

Negron_, 60 M.J. 136 (C.A.A.F. 2004).

d. _Additional Lesser Included Offenses_. The test to determine

whether an offense is factually the same as another offense, and

therefore lesser-included to that offense, is the "elements"

test. _United States v. Foster_, 40 M.J. 140, 142 (C.M.A. 1994). Under

this test, the court considers "whether each provision requires

proof of a fact which the other does not." _Blockburger_, 284 U.S.

299 at 304 (1932). Rather than adopting a literal application of

the elements test, the Court stated that resolution of lesser-included

claims "can only be resolved by lining up elements realistically

and determining whether each element of the supposed

'lesser' offense is rationally derivative of one or more elements of

the other offense - and vice versa." _Foster_, 40 M.J. at 146.

Whether an offense is a lesser-included offense is a matter of law

that the Court will consider de novo. _United States v. Palagar_, 56

M.J. 294, 296 (C.A.A.F. 2002).

e. _Maximum punishment_. _See 1995 Amendment_ regarding maximum

punishment of death.
