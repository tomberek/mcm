The jurisdictionof a court-martial with respect to military government or the law of waris not affected by the place where the court-martial sits except as otherwiseexpressly required by this Manual or applicable rule of international law.DiscussionIn addition to the power to try persons for offenses under the code, general courts-martial have power to try certain persons for violations ofthe law of war and for crimes or offenses against the law of the territoryoccupied as an incident of war or belligerency whenever the local civil authorityis superseded in whole or part by the military authority of the occupyingpower. _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(B). In cases where a personis tried by general court-martial for offenses against the law of an occupiedterritory, the court-martial normally sits in the country where the offenseis committed, and must do so under certain circumstances. _See_ Articles4, 64, and 66, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Personsin Time of War, August 12, 1949, arts. 4, 64, and 66, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 3559-60 T.I.A.S.

Otherwise for a court-martial to have jurisdiction:The court-martial must be convened by an official empowered to conveneit;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 504; 1302.The court-martial must be composed in accordance with these rules with respect to number and qualifications of its personnel. As used here "personnel" includes only the military judge, the members, andthe summary court-martial;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 501-504; 1301.Each charge before the court-martial must be referred to it bycompetent authority;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 601.The accused must be a person subject to court-martial jurisdiction; andDiscussion_See_ R.C.M. 202.The offense must be subject to court-martial jurisdiction.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 203. 

 The judgmentof a court-martial without jurisdiction is void and is entitled to no legaleffect. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)(iv). _But see_ R.C.M. 810(d) concerning the effect of certain decisions by courts-martial withoutjurisdiction.Contempt.A judge detailed to a court-martial may punish for contempt any person who uses any menacing word, sign, or gesture in the presence of the judge during the proceedings of the court-martial; disturbs the proceedings of the court-martial by any riot or disorder; or willfully disobeys the lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the court-martial. The punishment may not exceed confinement for 30 days or a fine of $1,000, or both.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 809 for procedures and standards forcontempt proceedings.Exclusive and nonexclusive jurisdiction.Courts-martial have exclusive jurisdiction of purely military offenses.An act or omission which violates both the code and local criminallaw, foreign or domestic, may be tried by a court-martial, or by a propercivilian tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, subject to R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)and regulations of the Secretary concerned, by both.Where an act or omission is subject to trial by court-martial andby one or more civil tribunals, foreign or domestic, the determination whichnation, state, or agency will exercise jurisdiction is a matter for the nations,states, and agencies concerned, and is not a right of the suspect or accused.DiscussionIn the case of an act or omission which violates the code and a criminal law of a State, the United States, or both, the determination whichagency shall exercise jurisdiction should normally be made through consultationor prior agreement between appropriate military officials (ordinarily thestaff judge advocate) and appropriate civilian authorities (United StatesAttorney, or equivalent). _See also_ Memorandum of UnderstandingBetween Departments of Justice and Defense Relating to the Investigationand Prosecution of Crimes Over Which the Two Departments Have ConcurrentJurisdiction at Appendix 3. 

 Under the Constitution, a personmay not be tried for the same misconduct by both a court-martial and anotherfederal court. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Although it is constitutionallypermissible to try a person by court-martial and by a State court for thesame act, as a matter of policy a person who is pending trial or has beentried by a State court should not ordinarily be tried by court-martial forthe same act. Overseas, international agreements might preclude trial byone state of a person acquitted or finally convicted of a given act by theother state. 

 Under international law, a friendly foreignnation has jurisdiction to punish offenses committed within its borders bymembers of a visiting force, unless expressly or impliedly consents to relinquishits jurisdiction to the visiting sovereign. The procedures and standardsfor determining which nation will exercise jurisdiction are normally establishedby treaty. _See_, for example, NATO Status of Forces Agreement,June 19, 1951, 4 U.S.T. 1792, T.I.A.S. No. 2846. As a matter of policy, effortsshould be made to maximize the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction overpersons subject to the code to the extent possible under applicable agreements. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 106 concerning delivery of offenders to civilian authorities. 

 _See_ also R.C.M. 201(g) concerning the jurisdiction of other militarytribunals.Reciprocal jurisdiction.Each armed force has court-martial jurisdiction over all personssubject to the code.A commander of a unified or specified combatant command may convene courts-martial over members of any of the armed forces.So much of the authority vested in the President under Article22(a)(9) to empower any commanding officer of a joint command or joint task force to convene courts-martial is delegated to the Secretary of Defense,and such a commanding officer may convene general courts-martial for thetrial of members of any of the armed forces assigned or attached to a combatant command or joint command.A commander who is empowered to convene a court-martial under subsections(e)(2)(A) or (e)(2)(B) of this rule may expressly authorize a commandingofficer of a subordinate joint command or subordinate joint task force whois authorized to convene special and summary courts-martial to convene suchcourts-martial for the trial of members of other armed forces assigned or attached to a joint command or joint task force, under regulationswhich the superior command may prescribe. A member of one armed force may be tried by a court-martial convened by a member of another armed force, using the implementing regulations and procedures prescribed by the Secretary concerned of the military service of the accused, when:The court-martial is convened by a commander authorized to convene courts-martial under subsection (e)(2) of this rule; orThe accused cannot be delivered to the armed force of which the accused is a member without manifest injury to the armed forces. 

Anaccused should not ordinarily be tried by a court-martial convened by a memberof a different armed force except when the circumstances described in (A)or (B) exist. However, failure to comply with this policy does not affectan otherwise valid referral.Nothing in this rule prohibits detailing to a court-martial a militaryjudge, member, or counsel who is a member of an armed force different from that of the accusedor the convening authority, or both.In all cases, departmental review after that by the officer withauthority to convene a general court-martial for the command which held thetrial, where that review is required by the code, shall be carried out bythe department that includes the armed force of which the accused is a member.When there is a disagreement between the Secretaries of two military departments or between the Secretary of a military department and the commander of a unified or specified combatant command or other joint command or joint task force as to which organization should exercise jurisdiction over a particularcase or class of cases, the Secretary of Defense or an official acting underthe authority of the Secretary of Defense shall designate which organizationwill exercise jurisdiction.Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) or as otherwise directedby the President or Secretary of Defense, whenever action under this Manualis required or authorized to be taken by a person superior to-a commander of a unified or specified combatant command or;a commander of any other joint command or joint task force thatis not part of a unified or specified combatant command, the mattershall be referred to the Secretary of the armed force of which the accusedis a member. The Secretary may convene a court-martial, take other appropriateaction, or, subject to R.C.M. 504(c), refer the matter to any person authorizedto convene a court-martial of the accused.DiscussionAs to the authority to convene courts-martial, see R.C.M. 504."Manifest injury" does not mean minor inconvenienceor expense. Examples of manifest injury include direct and substantial effecton morale, discipline, or military operations, substantial expense or delay,or loss of essential witnesses. 

 As to the composition ofa court-martial for the trial of an accused who is a member of another armedforce, _see_ R.C.M. 503(a)(3) Discussion. Cases involvingtwo or more accused who are members of different armed forces should notbe referred to a court-martial for a common trial.Types of courts-martial.**--LSQP--Note: R.C.M. 201(f)(1) and (f)(2) apply to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.--RSQP--**General courts-martial.Cases under the code.Except as otherwise expressly provided, general courts-martial maytry any person subject to the code for any offense made punishable underthe code. General courts-martial also may try any person for a violationof Article 83, 104, or 106. Upon a finding of guilty of an offense made punishable by the code, general courts-martial may, within limits prescribed by this Manual, adjudge any punishment authorized under R.C.M. 1003. Notwithstanding any other rule, the death penalty may not be adjudgedif:Not specifically authorized for the offense by the code and PartIV of this Manual; orThe case has not been referred with a special instruction that thecase is to be tried as capital.Cases under the law of war.General courts-martial may try any person who by the law of waris subject to trial by military tribunal for any crime or offense against:The law of war; orThe law of the territory occupied as an incident of war or belligerencywhenever the local civil authority is superseded in whole or part by themilitary authority of the occupying power. The law of the occupied territory includes the local criminal law as adopted or modified by competent authority,and the proclamations, ordinances, regulations, or orders promulgated bycompetent authority of the occupying power.DiscussionSubsection (f)(1)(B)(i)(b) is an exercise of thepower of military government.When a general court-martial exercises jurisdiction under the lawof war, it may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war.DiscussionCertain limitations on the discretion of military tribunals to adjudgepunishment under the law of war are prescribed in international conventions. _See_, for example, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection ofCivilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, art. 68, 6 U.S.T. 3516, T.I.A.S.No. 3365.Limitations in judge alone cases.A general court-martial composed only of a military judge does nothave jurisdiction to try any person for any offense for which the death penaltymay be adjudged unless the case has been referred to trial as noncapital.Jurisdiction for Certain Sexual Offenses. Only a general court-martial has jurisdiction to try offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), and 120b(b), UCMJ, forcible sodomy under Article 125, UCMJ, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ.Special courts-martial.In general.Except as otherwise expressly provided, special courts-martial maytry any person subject to the code for any noncapital offense made punishableby the code and, as provided in this rule, for capital offenses. Punishments.Upon a finding of guilty, special courts-martial may adjudge, underlimitations prescribed by this Manual, any punishment authorized under R.C.M.1003 except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal, confinement for morethan 1 year, hard labor without confinement for more than 3 months, forfeitureof pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture of pay for morethan 1 year. A bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, orforfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged by a specialcourt-martial unless:Counsel qualified under Article 27(b) is detailed to represent the accused; andA military judge is detailed to the trial, except in a case in whicha military judge could not be detailed because of physical conditions ormilitary exigencies. Physical conditions or military exigencies, as the termsare here used, may exist under rare circumstances, such as on an isolatedship on the high seas or in a unit in an inaccessible area, provided compellingreasons exist why trial must be held at that time and at that place. Mere inconvenience does not constitute a physical condition or military exigencyand does not excuse a failure to detail a military judge. If a military judgecannot be detailed because of physical conditions or military exigencies,a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeitureof pay for more than six months, may be adjudged provided the other conditionshave been met. In that event, however, the convening authority shall, priorto trial, make a written statement explaining why a military judge couldnot be obtained. This statement shall be appended to the record of trialand shall set forth in detail the reasons why a military judge could not bedetailed, and why the trial had to be held at that time and place.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 503 concerning detailing the militaryjudge and counsel. 

 The requirement for counsel is satisfiedwhen counsel qualified under Article 27(b), and not otherwise disqualified,has been detailed and made available, even though the accused may not chooseto cooperate with, or use the services of, such detailed counsel. 

 Thephysical condition or military exigency exception to the requirement fora military judge does not apply to the requirement for detailing counsel qualifiedunder Article 27(b). 

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(c)concerning the requirements for a record of trial in special courts-martial.Capital offensesA capital offense for which there is prescribed a mandatory punishmentbeyond the punitive power of a special court-martial shall not be referredto such a court-martial. An officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over thecommand which includes the accused may permit any capital offense other thanone described in subsection (f)(2)(C)(i) of this rule to be referred to aspecial court-martial for trial. The Secretary concerned may authorize, by regulation, officers exercisingspecial court-martial jurisdiction to refer capital offenses, other thanthose described in subsection (f)(2)(C)(i) of this rule, to trial by specialcourt-martial without first obtaining the consent of the officer exercisinggeneral court-martial jurisdiction over the command.Certain Offenses under Articles 120, 120b, and 125.Notwithstanding subsection (f)(2)(A), special courts-martial do not have jurisdiction over offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), and 120b(b), forcible sodomy under Article 125, UCMJ, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ. Such offenses shall not be referred to a special court-martial.Discussion Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, only a general court-martial has jurisdiction over penetrative sex offenses under subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120, subsections (a) and (b) of Article 120b, Article 125, and attempts to commit such penetrative sex offenses under Article 80, UCMJ.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 103(3) for a definition of capital offenses.Summary courts-martial._See_ R.C.M. 1301(c) and (d)(1). Concurrent jurisdiction of other military tribunals.The provisions of the code and this Manual conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial do not deprive military commissions, provost courts,or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offendersor offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by militarycommissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.Discussion_See_ Articles 104 and 106 for some instances ofconcurrent jurisdiction.Persons subject to the jurisdiction of courts-martialIn general.Courts-martial may try any person when authorized to do so underthe code.DiscussionAuthority under the code.Article 2 lists classes of persons who are subject to the code.These include active duty personnel (Article 2(a)(1)); cadets, aviation cadets,and midshipmen (Article 2(a)(2)); certain retired personnel (Article 2(a)(4)and (5)); members of Reserve components not on active duty under some circumstances(Article 2(a)(3) and (6)); persons in the custody of the armed forces servinga sentence imposed by court-martial (Article 2(a)(7)); and, under some circumstances,specified categories of civilians (Article 2(a)(8), (9), (10), (11), and(12); _see_ subsection (3) and (4) of this discussion). In addition, certain persons whose status as members of the armed forces oras persons otherwise subject to the code apparently has ended may, nevertheless,be amendable to trial by court-martial. _See_ Article 3, 4,and 73. A person need not be subject to the code to be subject to trial bycourt-martial under Articles 83, 104, or 106. _See also_ Article48 and R.C.M. 809 concerning who may be subject to the contempt powers ofa court-martial. Active duty personnel.Court-martial jurisdiction is most commonly exercised over active duty personnel. In general, a person becomes subject to court-martial jurisdictionupon enlistment in or induction into the armed forces, acceptance of a commission,or entry onto active duty pursuant to orders. Court-martial jurisdictionover active duty personnel ordinarily ends on delivery of a discharge certificate or its equivalent to the person concerned issued pursuant to competent orders.Orders transferring a person to the inactive reserve are the equivalent ofa discharge certificate for purposes of jurisdiction. 

 Theseare several important qualifications and exceptions to these general guidelines.Inception of court-martial jurisdiction over active duty personnel.Enlistment."The voluntary enlistment of any person who has the capacityto understand the significance of enlisting in the armed forces shall bevalid for purposes of jurisdiction under --LSQP--Article 2(a)--RSQP--and a change of status from civilian to member of the armed forces shall be effective upon taking the oath of enlistment." Article 2(b). A personwho is, at the time of enlistment, insane, intoxicated, or under the ageof 17 does not have the capacity to enlist by law. No court-martial jurisdictionover such a person may exist as long as the incapacity continues. If the incapacityceases to exist, a "constructive enlistment" may result underArticle 2(c). _See_ discussion of "constructive enlistment"below. Similarly, if the enlistment was involuntary, court-martial jurisdictionwill exist only when the coercion is removed and a "constructive enlistment"under Article 2(c) is established. 

 Persons age 17 (but notyet 18) may not enlist without parental consent. A parent or guardian may,within 90 days of its inception, terminate the enlistment of a 17-year-oldwho enlisted without parental consent, if the person has not yet reachedthe age of 18. 10 U.S.C. --SECT-- 1170. _See also_ DOD Directive1332.14 and service regulations for specific rules on separation of persons17 years of age on the basis of a parental request. Absent effective actionby a parent or guardian to terminate such an enlistment, court-martial jurisdictionexists over the person. An application by a parent for release does not deprivea court-martial of jurisdiction to try a person for offenses committed beforeaction is completed on such an application. 

 Even if a personlacked capacity to understand the effect of enlistment or did not enlist voluntarily,a "constructive enlistment" may be established under Article2(c), which provides: 

 Notwithstanding any otherprovision of law, a person serving with an armed force who- submitted voluntary to military authority;met the mental competency and minimum age qualificationsof sections 504 and 505 of this title at the time of voluntary submissionto military authority --LSQP--that is, not insane, intoxicated, or underthe age of 17--RSQP--received military pay or allowances; andperformed military duties; 

is subject to --LSQP--the code--RSQP-- until such person'sactive service has been terminated in accordance with law or regulationspromulgated by the Secretary concerned. 

 Even if a personnever underwent an enlistment or induction proceeding of any kind, court-martialjurisdiction could be established under this provision.Induction.Court-martial jurisdiction does not extend to a draftee until: the draftee has completed an induction ceremony which was in substantial compliancewith the requirements prescribed by statute and regulations; the drafteeby conduct after an apparent induction, has waived objection to substantivedefects in it; or a "constructive enlistment" under Article 2(c)exists. 

 The fact that a person was improperly inducted (forexample, because of incorrect classification or erroneous denial of exemption)does not of itself negate court-martial jurisdiction. When a person has madetimely and persistent efforts to correct such an error, court-martial jurisdictionmay be defeated if improper induction is found, depending on all the circumstancesof the case.Call to active duty.A member of a reserve component may be called or ordered to active duty for a variety of reasons, including training, service in time of waror national emergency, discipline, or as a result of failure to participatesatisfactorily in unit activities. 

 When a person is orderedto active duty for failure to satisfactorily participate in unit activities,the order must substantially comply with procedures prescribed by regulations,to the extent due process requires, for court-martial jurisdiction to exist.Generally, the person must be given notice of the activation and the reasonstherefor, and an opportunity to object to the activation. A person waivesthe right to contest involuntary activation by failure to exercise this right within a reasonable time after notice of the right to do so.Termination of jurisdiction over active duty personnel.As indicated above, the delivery of a valid discharge certificateor its equivalent ordinarily serves to terminate court-martial jurisdiction.Effect of completion of term of service.Completion of an enlistment or term of service does not by itself terminate court-martial jurisdiction. An original term of enlistment maybe adjusted for a variety of reasons, such as making up time lost for unauthorizedabsence. Even after such adjustments are considered, court-martial jurisdictionnormally continues past the time of scheduled separation until a dischargecertificate or its equivalent is delivered or until the Government fails toact within a reasonable time after the person objects to continued retention. 

 Asindicated in subsection (c) of this rule, servicemembers may be retainedpast their scheduled time of separation, over protest, by action with a viewto trial while they are still subject to the code. Thus, if action with aview to trial is initiated before discharge or the effective terminal dateof self-executing orders, a person may be retained beyond the date that the period of service would otherwise have expired or the terminal date of suchorders.Effect of discharge and reenlistment.For offenses occurring on or after 23 October 1992, under the 1992 Amendment to Article 3(a), a person who reenlists following a discharge maybe tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service. For offensesoccurring prior to 23 October 1992, a person who reenlists following a dischargemay be tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service onlyif the offense was punishable by confinement for five (5) years or more andcould not be tried in the courts of the United States or of a State, a Territory,or the District of Columbia. However, _see_ (iii)(a) below.Exceptions.There are several exceptions to the general principle that court-martialjurisdiction terminates on discharge or its equivalent.A person who was subject to the code at the time an offense was committed may be tried by court-martial for that offense despite a laterdischarge or other termination of that status if:For offenses occurring on or after 23 October 1992, the person is,at the time of the court-martial, subject to the code, by reentry into thearmed forces or otherwise. _See_ Article 3(a) as amended bythe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-484,106 Stat. 2315, 2505 (1992);For offenses occurring before 23 October 1992,The offense is one for which a court-martial may adjudge confinementfor five (5) or more years;The person cannot be tried in the courts of the United States orof a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia; andThe person is, at the time of the court-martial, subject to thecode, by reentry into the armed forces or otherwise. _See_ Article3(a) prior to the 1992 amendment.A person who was subject to the code at the time the offense wascommitted is subject to trial by court-martial despite a later dischargeif-The discharge was issued before the end of the accused's term ofenlistment for the purpose of reenlisting;The person remains, at the time of the court-martial, subject tothe code; andThe reenlistment occurred after 26 July 1982.Persons in the custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposedby a court-martial remain subject to the code and court-martial jurisdiction.A prisoner who has received a discharge and who remains in the custody ofan armed force may be tried for an offense committed while a member of thearmed forces and before the execution of the discharge as well as for offensescommitted after it.A person discharged from the armed forces who is later charged withhaving fraudulently obtained that discharge is, subject to the statute oflimitations, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge, and is afterapprehension subject to the code while in the custody of the armed forcesfor trial. Upon conviction of that charge such a person is subject to trialby court-martial for any offenses under the code committed before the fraudulentdischarge.No person who has deserted from the armed forces is relieved fromcourt-martial jurisdiction by a separation from any later period of service.When a person's discharge or other separation does not interruptthe status as a person belonging to the general category of persons subjectto the code, court-martial jurisdiction over that person does not end. Forexample, when an officer holding a commission in a Reserve component of anarmed force is discharged from that commission while on active duty becauseof acceptance of a commission in a Regular component of that armed force,without an interval between the periods of service under the two commissions,that officer's military status does not end. There is merely a change inpersonnel status from temporary to permanent officer, and court-martial jurisdictionover an offense committed before the discharge is not affected.Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Members of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration become subject to the code when assigned to andserving with the armed forces.Limitations on jurisdiction over civilians.Court-martial jurisdiction over civilians under the code is limited by the Constitution and other applicable laws, including as construed in judicial decisions. The exercise of jurisdiction under Article 2(a)(11) in peace time has been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. Before initiating court-martial proceedings against a civilian, relevant statutes, decisions, service regulations, and policy memoranda should be carefully examined.Members of a Reserve Component.Members of a reserve component in federal service on active duty,as well as those in federal service on inactive-duty training, are subjectto the code. Moreover, members of a reserve component are amenable to thejurisdiction of courts-martial notwithstanding the termination of a periodof such duty. _See_ R.C.M. 204.Offenses under the law of war.Nothing in this rule limits the power of general courts-martialto try persons under the law of war. _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(B).Attachment of jurisdiction over the person.In general.Court-martial jurisdiction attaches over a person when action witha view to trial of that person is taken. Once court-martial jurisdictionover a person attaches, such jurisdiction shall continue for all purposesof trial, sentence, and punishment, notwithstanding the expiration of thatperson's term of service or other period in which that person was subjectto the code or trial by court-martial. When jurisdiction attaches over aservicemember on active duty, the servicemember may be held on active dutyover objection pending disposition of any offense for which held and shallremain subject to the code during the entire period.DiscussionCourt-martial jurisdiction exists to try a person as long as that person occupies a status as a person subject to the code. _See also_ Article 104 and 106. Thus, a servicemember is subject to court-martialjurisdiction until lawfully discharged or, when the servicemember's term of service has expired, the government fails to act within a reasonable timeon objection by the servicemember to continued retention. 

 Court-martialjurisdiction attaches over a person upon action with a view to trial. Oncecourt-martial jurisdiction attaches, it continues throughout the trial and appellate process, and for purposes of punishment. 

 If jurisdictionhas attached before the effective terminal date of self-executing orders,the person may be held for trial by court-martial beyond the effective terminaldate.Procedure.Actions by which court-martial jurisdiction attaches include: apprehension;imposition of restraint, such as restriction, arrest, or confinement; andpreferral of charges. Jurisdiction over the offenseTo the extent permitted by the Constitution, courts-martial maytry any offense under the code and, in the case of general courts-martial,the law of war.DiscussionIn general.Courts-martial have power to try any offense under the code except when prohibited from so doing by the Constitution. The rule enunciated in_Solorio v. United States_, 483 U.S. 435 (1987) is that jurisdictionof courts-martial depends solely on the accused's status as a person subjectto the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and not on the "service-connection"of the offense charged.Pleading and proof.Normally, the inclusion of the accused's rank or grade will be sufficientto plead the service status of the accused. Ordinarily, no allegation ofthe accused's armed force or unit is necessary for military members on activeduty. _See_ R.C.M. 307 regarding required specificity of pleadings.Jurisdiction over certain reserve component personnelService regulations.The Secretary concerned shall prescribe regulations setting forth rules and procedures for the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction and nonjudicialpunishment authority over reserve component personnel under Article 2(a)(3)and 2(d), subject to the limitations of this Manual and the UCMJ.DiscussionSuch regulations should describe procedures for ordering a reservist to active duty for disciplinary action, for the preferral, investigation, forwarding, and referral of charges, designation of convening authoritiesand commanders authorized to conduct nonjudicial punishment proceedings,and for other appropriate purposes. 

 _See_ definitionsin R.C.M. 103 (Discussion). _See_ paragraph 5e and f, PartV, concerning limitations on nonjudicial punishments imposed on reservistswhile on inactive-duty training. 

 Members of the Army NationalGuard and the Air National Guard are subject to Federal court-martial jurisdictiononly when the offense concerned is committed while the member is in Federalservice.Courts-MartialGeneral and special court-martial proceedings.A member of a reserve component must be on active duty prior to arraignment at a general or special court-martial. A member ordered to activeduty pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty to serve anyadjudged confinement or other restriction on liberty if the order to activeduty was approved in accordance with Article 2(d)(5), but such member maynot be retained on active duty pursuant to Article 2(d) after service ofthe confinement or other restriction on liberty. All punishments remaining unserved at the time the member is released from active duty may be carriedover to subsequent periods of inactive-duty training or active duty.DiscussionAn accused ordered to active duty pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty after service of the punishment if permitted by otherauthority. For example, an accused who commits another offense while on activeduty ordered pursuant to Article 2(d) may be retained on active duty pursuant to R.C.M. 202(c)(1).Summary courts-martial.A member of a reserve component may be tried by summary court-martialeither while on active duty or inactive-duty training. A summary court-martialconducted during inactive-duty training may be in session only during normalperiods of such training. The accused may not be held beyond such periodsof training for trial or service or any punishment. All punishments remainingunserved at the end of a period of active duty or the end of any normal periodof inactive duty training may be carried over to subsequent periods of inactive-dutytraining or active duty.DiscussionA "normal period" of inactive-duty training does not include periods which are scheduled solely for the purpose of conducting court-martial proceedings.Applicability.This subsection is not applicable when a member is held on activeduty pursuant to R.C.M. 202(c). Changes in type of service.A member of a reserve component at the time disciplinary actionis initiated, who is alleged to have committed an offense while on activeduty or inactive-duty training, is subject to court-martial jurisdictionwithout regard to any change between active and reserve service or within different categories of reserve service subsequent to commission of the offense.This subsection does not apply to a person whose military status was completelyterminated after commission of an offense.DiscussionA member of a regular or reserve component remains subject to court-martialjurisdiction after leaving active duty for offenses committed prior to suchtermination of active duty if the member retains military status in a reservecomponent without having been discharged from all obligations of militaryservice. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 202(a), Discussion,paragraph (2)(B)(ii) and (iii) regarding the jurisdictional effect of a dischargefrom military service. A "complete termination" of military statusrefers to a discharge relieving the servicemember of any further militaryservice. It does not include a discharge conditioned upon acceptance of further military service.INITIATION OF CHARGES; APPREHENSION; PRETRIAL RESTRAINT; RELATED MATTERSReport of offenseWho may report.Any person may report an offense subject to trial by court-martial.To whom reports conveyed for disposition.Ordinarily, any military authority who receives a report of anoffense shall forward as soon as practicable the report and any accompanyinginformation to the immediate commander of the suspect. Competent authoritysuperior to that commander may direct otherwise.DiscussionAny military authority may receive a report of an offense. Typically such reports are made to law enforcement or investigative personnel, or toappropriate persons in the chain of command. A report may be made by anymeans, and no particular format is required. When a person who is not a lawenforcement official receives a report of an offense, that person shouldforward the report to the immediate commander of the suspect unless thatperson believes it would be more appropriate to notify law enforcement orinvestigative authorities. 

 If the suspect is unidentified,the military authority who receives the report should refer it to a law enforcementor investigative agency. 

 Upon receipt of a report, the immediatecommander of a suspect should refer to R.C.M. 306 (Initial disposition). _See also_ R.C.M. 302 (Apprehension); R.C.M. 303 (Preliminary inquiry);R.C.M. 304, 305 (Pretrial restraint, confinement).ApprehensionDefinition and scope.Definition.Apprehension is the taking of a person into custody.DiscussionApprehension is the equivalent of "arrest" in civilianterminology. (In military terminology, "arrest" is a form ofrestraint. _ See_ Article 9; R.C.M. 304.) _See_ subsection(c) of this rule concerning the bases for apprehension. An apprehension isnot required in every case; the fact that an accused was never apprehendeddoes not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial to try the accused. However, _ see_ R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction. 

 Anapprehension is different from detention of a person for investigative purposes,although each involves the exercise of government control over the freedomof movement of a person. An apprehension must be based on probable cause,and the custody initiated in an apprehension may continue until proper authorityis notified and acts under R.C.M. 304 or 305. An investigative detention may be made on less than probable cause (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 314(f)),and normally involves a relatively short period of custody. Furthermore,an extensive search of the person is not authorized incident to an investigativedetention, as it is with an apprehension. _See_ Mil. R. Evid.314(f) and (g). This rule does not affect any seizure of the person lesssevere than apprehension. 

 Evidence obtained as the resultof an apprehension which is in violation of this rule may be challenged underMil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1). Evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful civilianarrest may be challenged under Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1), (2).Scope.This rule applies only to apprehensions made by persons authorizedto do so under subsection (b) of this rule with respect to offenses subjectto trial by court-martial. Nothing in this rule limits the authority of federallaw enforcement officials to apprehend persons, whether or not subject totrial by court-martial, to the extent permitted by applicable enabling statutesand other law.DiscussionR.C.M. 302 does not affect the authority of any official to detain, arrest, or apprehend persons not subject to trial under the code. The ruledoes not apply to actions taken by any person in a private capacity. 

 Severalfederal agencies have broad powers to apprehend persons for violations offederal laws, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For example,agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Marshals, andagents of the Secret Service may apprehend persons for any offenses committedin their presence and for felonies. 18 U.S.C. --SECT----SECT-- 3052, 3053, 3056. Other agencies have apprehension powers include the General Services Administration,40 U.S.C. --SECT-- 318 and the Veterans Administration, 38 U.S.C. --SECT-- 218.The extent to which such agencies become involved in the apprehension ofpersons subject to trial by courts-martial may depend on the statutory authorityof the agency and the agency's formal or informal relationships with theDepartment of Defense.Who may apprehend.The following officials may apprehend any person subject to trialby court-martial: Military law enforcement officials.Security police, military police, master at arms personnel, members of the shore patrol, and persons designated by proper authorities to performmilitary criminal investigative, guard, or police duties, whether subjectto the code or not, when in each of the foregoing instances, the officialmaking the apprehension is in the execution of law enforcement duties;DiscussionWhenever enlisted persons, including police and guards, and civilianpolice and guards apprehend any commissioned or warrant officer, such personsshould make an immediate report to the commissioned officer to whom the apprehendingperson is responsible. 

 The phrase "persons designatedby proper authority to perform military criminal investigative, guard orpolice duties" includes special agents of the Defense Criminal InvestigativeService.Commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers.All commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers onactive duty or inactive duty training; DiscussionNoncommissioned and petty officers not otherwise performing law enforcement duties should not apprehend a commissioned officer unless directedto do so by a commissioned officer or in order to prevent disgrace to theservice or the escape of one who has committed a serious offense.Civilians authorized to apprehend deserters.Under Article 8, any civilian officer having authority to apprehend offenders under laws of the United States or of a State, Territory, Commonwealth,or possession, or the District of Columbia, when the apprehension is of adeserter from the armed forces.DiscussionThe code specifically provides that any civil officer, whether ofa State, Territory, district, or of the United States may apprehend any deserter. However,this authority does not permit state and local law enforcement officers toapprehend persons for other violations of the code. _ See_ Article8.Grounds for apprehension.A person subject to the code or trial thereunder may be apprehended for an offense triable by court-martial upon probable cause to apprehend. Probable cause to apprehend exists when there are reasonable grounds to believethat an offense has been or is being committed and the person to be apprehendedcommitted or is committing it. Persons authorized to apprehend under subsection(b)(2) of this rule may also apprehend persons subject to the code who takepart in quarrels, frays, or disorders, wherever they occur.Discussion"Reasonable grounds" means that there must be the kindof reliable information that a reasonable, prudent person would rely on whichmakes it more likely than not that something is true. A mere suspicion isnot enough but proof which would support a conviction is not necessary. Aperson who determines probable cause may rely on the reports of others.How an apprehension may be made.In general.An apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person to be apprehendedthat person is in custody. This notice should be given orally or in writing,but it may be implied by the circumstances.Warrants.Neither warrants nor any other authorization shall be required foran apprehension under these rules except as required in subsection (e)(2)of this rule. Use of force.Any person authorized under these rules to make an apprehensionmay use such force and means as reasonably necessary under the circumstancesto effect the apprehension.DiscussionIn addition to any other action required by law or regulation or proper military officials, any person making an apprehension under theserules should maintain custody of the person apprehended and inform as promptlyas possible the immediate commander of the person apprehended, or any officialhigher in the chain of command of the person apprehended if it is impractical to inform the immediate commander.Where an apprehension may be made.In general.An apprehension may be made at any place, except as provided insubsection (e)(2) of this rule. Private dwellings.A private dwelling includes dwellings, on or off a military installation,such as single family houses, duplexes, and apartments. The quarters may beowned, leased, or rented by the residents, or assigned, and may be occupiedon a temporary or permanent basis. "Private dwelling" does notinclude the following, whether or not subdivided into individual units: livingareas in military barracks, vessels, aircraft, vehicles, tents, bunkers,field encampments, and similar places. No person may enter a private dwellingfor the purpose of making an apprehension under these rules unless: Pursuant to consent under Mil. R. Evid. 314(e) or 316(d)(2); Under exigent circumstances described in Mil. R. Evid. 315(g) or316(d)(4)(B); In the case of a private dwelling which is military property orunder military control, or nonmilitary property in a foreign countryif the person to be apprehended is a resident of the private dwelling,there exists, at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the personto be apprehended is present in the dwelling, and the apprehension has beenauthorized by an official listed in Mil. R. Evid. 315(d) upon a determinationthat probable cause to apprehend the person exists; or if the person to be apprehended is not a resident of the private dwelling, the entry has been authorized by an official listed in Mil. R.Evid. 315(d) upon a determination that probable cause exists to apprehendthe person and to believe that the person to be apprehended is or will be present at the time of the entry; In the case of a private dwelling not included in subsection (e)(2)(C)of this rule, if the person to be apprehended is a resident of the private dwelling,there exists at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the person tobe apprehended is present and the apprehension is authorized by an arrestwarrant issued by competent civilian authority; or if the person to be apprehended is not a resident of the private dwelling, the apprehension is authorized by an arrest warrant and the entryis authorized by a search warrant, each issued by competent civilian authority. Aperson who is not a resident of the private dwelling entered may not challengethe legality of an apprehension of that person on the basis of failure tosecure a warrant or authorization to enter that dwelling, or on the basisof the sufficiency of such a warrant or authorization. Nothing in this subsection((e)(2)) affects the legality of an apprehension which is incident to otherwiselawful presence in a private dwelling.DiscussionFor example, if law enforcement officials enter a private dwellingpursuant to a valid search warrant or search authorization, they may apprehendpersons therein if grounds for an apprehension exist. This subsection is not intended to be an independent grant of authority to execute civilian arrestor search warrants. The authority must derive from an appropriate Federalor state procedure. _See e.g._ Fed. R. Crim. P. 41 and 28 C.F.R.60.1. Preliminary inquiry into reported offensesUpon receipt of information that a member of the command is accusedor suspected of committing an offense or offenses triable by court-martial,the immediate commander shall make or cause to be made a preliminary inquiryinto the charges or suspected offenses.DiscussionThe preliminary inquiry is usually informal. It may be an examinationof the charges and an investigative report or other summary of expected evidence.In other cases a more extensive investigation may be necessary. Althoughthe commander may conduct the investigation personally or with members ofthe command, in serious or complex cases the commander should consider whetherto seek the assistance of law enforcement personnel in conducting any inquiryor further investigation. The inquiry should gather all reasonably availableevidence bearing on guilt or innocence and any evidence relating to aggravation,extenuation, or mitigation. 

 The Military Rules of Evidenceshould be consulted when conducting interrogations (_see_Mil. R. Evid. 301-306), searches (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 311-317),and eyewitness identifications (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 321). 

 Ifthe offense is one for which the Department of Justice has investigative responsibilities, appropriate coordination should be made under the Memorandum of Understanding,_see_ Appendix 3, and any implementing regulations. 

 Ifit appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings inthe case, this should be brought to the attention of appropriate authorities. _See also_ R.C.M. 702 (depositions). 

 A person whois an accuser (_see_ Article 1(9)) is disqualified from convening a general or special court-martial in that case. R.C.M. 504(c)(1). Therefore,when the immediate commander is a general or special court-martial conveningauthority, the preliminary inquiry should be conducted by another officerof the command. That officer may be informed that charges may be preferredif the officer determines that preferral is warranted.Pretrial restraintTypes of pretrial restraint.Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a person'sliberty which is imposed before and during disposition of offenses. Pretrialrestraint may consist of conditions on liberty, restriction in lieu of arrest, arrest, or confinement.Conditions on liberty.Conditions on liberty are imposed by orders directing a person todo or refrain from doing specified acts. Such conditions may be imposed inconjunction with other forms of restraint or separately.Restriction in lieu of arrest.Restriction in lieu of arrest is the restraint of a person by oralor written orders directing the person to remain within specified limits;a restricted person shall, unless otherwise directed, perform full militaryduties while restricted.Arrest.Arrest is the restraint of a person by oral or written order notimposed as punishment, directing the person to remain within specified limits;a person in the status of arrest may not be required to perform full militaryduties such as commanding or supervising personnel, serving as guard, or bearingarms. The status of arrest automatically ends when the person is placed,by the authority who ordered the arrest or a superior authority, on dutyinconsistent with the status of arrest, but this shall not prevent requiringthe person arrested to do ordinary cleaning or policing, or to take partin routine training and duties.Confinement.Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order ofcompetent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition ofoffenses. _See_ R.C.M. 305.DiscussionConditions on liberty include orders to report periodically to aspecified official, orders not to go to a certain place (such as the sceneof the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with specified persons(such as the alleged victim or potential witnesses). Conditions on libertymust not hinder pretrial preparation, however. Thus, when such conditionsare imposed, they must by sufficiently flexible to permit pretrial preparation. 

 Restrictionin lieu of arrest is a less severe restraint on liberty than is arrest. Arrest includes suspension from performing full military duties and the limits ofarrest are normally narrower than those of restriction in lieu of arrest.The actual nature of the restraint imposed, and not the characterizationof it by the officer imposing it, will determine whether it is technicallyan arrest or restriction in lieu of arrest. 

 Breach of arrestor restriction in lieu of arrest or violation of conditions on liberty areoffenses under the code. _See_ paragraphs 16, 19, and 102, Part IV. When such an offense occurs, it may warrant appropriate action suchas nonjudicial punishment or court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 306.In addition, such a breach or violation may provide a basis for the impositionof a more severe form of restraint. 

 R.C.M. 707(a) requiresthat the accused be brought to trial within 120 days of preferral of chargesor imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4).Who may order pretrial restraint.Of civilians and officers.Only a commanding officer to whose authority the civilian or officeris subject may order pretrial restraint of that civilian or officer.DiscussionCivilians may be restrained under these rules only when they aresubject to trial by court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 202.Of enlisted persons.Any commissioned officer may order pretrial restraint of any enlistedperson.Delegation of authority.The authority to order pretrial restraint of civilians and commissionedand warrant officers may not be delegated. A commanding officer may delegateto warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers authority to order pretrialrestraint of enlisted persons of the commanding officer's command or subjectto the authority of that commanding officer.Authority to withhold.A superior competent authority may withhold from a subordinate the authority to order pretrial restraint.When a person may be restrained.No person may be ordered into restraint before trial except forprobable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial restraint exists when thereis a reasonable belief that:An offense triable by court-martial has been committed;The person to be restrained committed it; andThe restraint ordered is required by the circumstances.DiscussionThe decision whether to impose pretrial restraint, and, if so, whattype or types, should be made on a case-by-case basis. The factors listedin the Discussion of R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B) should be considered. The restraintshould not be more rigorous than the circumstances require to ensure thepresence of the person restrained or to prevent foreseeable serious criminalmisconduct. 

 Restraint is not required in every case. Theabsence of pretrial restraint does not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial.However, _see_ R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction. _See_ R.C.M. 305 concerning the standards and procedures governingpretrial confinement.Procedures for ordering pretrial restraint.Pretrial restraint other than confinement is imposed by notifyingthe person orally or in writing of the restraint, including its terms orlimits. The order to an enlisted person shall be delivered personally bythe authority who issues it or through other persons subject to the code.The order to an officer or a civilian shall be delivered personally by theauthority who issues it or by another commissioned officer. Pretrial confinementis imposed pursuant to orders by a competent authority by the delivery ofa person to a place of confinement.Notice of basis for restraint.When a person is placed under restraint, the person shall be informedof the nature of the offense which is the basis for such restraint.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 305(e) concerning additional informationwhich must be given to a person who is confined. If the person ordering therestrain is not the commander of the person restrained, that officer shouldbe notified.Punishment prohibited.Pretrial restraint is not punishment and shall not be used as such. No person who is restrained pending trial may be subjected to punishmentor penalty for the offense which is the basis for that restraint. Prisonersbeing held for trial shall not be required to undergo punitive duty hoursor training, perform punitive labor, or wear special uniforms prescribedonly for post-trial prisoners. This rule does not prohibit minor punishmentduring pretrial confinement for infractions of the rules of the place of confinement.Prisoners shall be afforded facilities and treatment under regulations ofthe Secretary concerned.DiscussionOffenses under the code by a person under restraint may be disposed of in the same manner as any other offenses.Release.Except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 305, a person may be released from pretrial restraint by a person authorized to impose it. Pretrial restraintshall terminate when a sentence is adjudged, the accused is acquitted ofall charges, or all charges are dismissed.DiscussionPretrial restraint may be imposed (or reimposed) if charges areto be reinstated or a rehearing or "other" trial is to beordered.Administrative restraint.Nothing in this rule prohibits limitations on a servicemember imposed for operational or other military purposes independent of military justice,including administrative hold or medical reasons.Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 306.Pretrial confinementIn general.Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order of competent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of charges.DiscussionNo member of the armed forces may be placed in confinement in immediateassociation with enemy prisoners or other foreign nationals not members ofthe armed forces of the United States. Article 12. However, if members ofthe armed forces of the United States are separated from prisoners of theother categories mentioned, they may be confined in the same confinementfacilities.Who may be confined.Any person who is subject to trial by court-martial may be confined if the requirements of this rule are met.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 201 and 202 and the discussions thereinconcerning persons who are subject to trial by courts-martial.Who may order confinement._See_ R.C.M. 304(b).Discussion"No provost marshal, commander of a guard, or master at arms may refuse to receive or keep any prisoner committed to his charge by acommissioned officer of the armed forces, when the committing officer furnishes a statement, signed by him, of the offense charged against the prisoner." Article 11(a).When a person may be confined.No person may be ordered into pretrial confinement except for probablecause. Probable cause to order pretrial confinement exists when there isa reasonable belief that:An offense triable by court-martial has been committed;The person confined committed it; andConfinement is required by the circumstances.DiscussionThe person who directs confinement should consider the mattersdiscussed under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule before ordering confinement. However, the person who initially orders confinement is not required to makea detailed analysis of the necessity for confinement. It is often not possibleto review a person's background and character or even the details of an offense before physically detaining the person. For example, until additional informationcan be secured, it may be necessary to confine a person apprehended in thecourse of a violent crime. 

 "--LSQP--W--RSQP--hencharged only with an offense normally tried by summary court-martial, --LSQP--anaccused--RSQP-- shall not ordinarily be paced in confinement." Article10. 

 Confinement should be distinguished from custody. Custody is restraint which is imposed by apprehension and which may be, but is not necessarily, physical. Custody may be imposed by anyone authorized to apprehend(_see_ R.C.M. 302(b)), and may continue until a proper authorityunder R.C.M. 304(B) is notified and takes action. Thus, a person who hasbeen apprehended could be physically restrained, but this would not be pretrialconfinement in the sense of this rule until a person authorized to do sounder R.C.M. 304(b) directed confinement.Advice to the accused upon confinement.Each person confined shall be promptly informed of:The nature of the offenses for which held;The right to remain silent and that any statement made by the personmay be used against the person; The right to retain civilian counsel at no expense to the UnitedStates, and the right to request assignment of military counsel; andThe procedures by which pretrial confinement will be reviewed.Military counsel.If requested by the prisoner and such request is made known tomilitary authorities, military counsel shall be provided to the prisoner beforethe initial review under subsection (i) of this rule or within 72 hours ofsuch a request being first communicated to military authorities, whicheveroccurs first. Counsel may be assigned for the limited purpose of representingthe accused only during the pretrial confinement proceedings before chargesare referred. If assignment is made for this limited purpose, the prisonershall be so informed. Unless otherwise provided by regulations of the Secretaryconcerned, a prisoner does not have a right under this rule to have militarycounsel of the prisoner's own selection.Who may direct release from confinement.Any commander of a prisoner, an officer appointed under regulations of the Secretary concerned to conduct the review under subsection (i) and/or (j) of this rule, or, once charges have been referred, a military judgedetailed to the court-martial to which the charges against the accused havebeen referred, may direct release from pretrial confinement. For purposesof this subsection, "any commander" includes the immediate orhigher commander of the prisoner and the commander of the installation onwhich the confinement facility is located.Notification and action by commander.Report.Unless the commander of the prisoner ordered the pretrial confinement,the commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer into whose chargethe prisoner was committed shall, within 24 hours after that commitment,cause a report to be made to the commander that shall contain the name ofthe prisoner, the offenses charged against the prisoner, and the name ofthe person who ordered or authorized confinement.DiscussionThis report may be made by any means. Ordinarily, the immediate commander of the prisoner should be notified. In unusual cases any commanderto whose authority the prisoner is subject, such as the commander of the confinement facility, may be notified. In the latter case, the commanderso notified must ensure compliance with subsection (h)(2) of this rule.Action by commander.Decision.Not later than 72 hours after the commander's ordering of a prisoner into pretrial confinement or, after receipt of a report that a member ofthe commander's unit or organization has been confined, whichever situationis applicable, the commander shall decide whether pretrial confinement willcontinue. A commander's compliance with this subsection may also satisfythe 48-hour probable cause determination of subsection R.C.M. 305(i)(1) below,provided the commander is a neutral and detached officer and acts within48 hours of the imposition of confinement under military control. Nothingin subsections R.C.M. 305(d), R.C.M. 305(i)(1), or this subsection preventsa neutral and detached commander from completing the 48-hour probable causedetermination and the 72-hour commander's decision immediately after an accusedis ordered into pretrial confinement.Requirements for confinement.The commander shall direct the prisoner's release from pretrial confinement unless the commander believes upon probable cause, that is, upon reasonable grounds, that:An offense triable by a court-martial has been committed;The prisoner committed it; andConfinement is necessary because it is foreseeable that:The prisoner will not appear at trial, pretrial hearing, or investigation,orThe prisoner will engage in serious criminal misconduct; andLess severe forms of restraint are inadequate. 

 Seriouscriminal misconduct includes intimidation of witnesses or other obstructionof justice, serious injury of others, or other offenses which pose a seriousthreat to the safety of the community or to the effectiveness, morale, discipline,readiness, or safety of the command, or to the national security of the UnitedStates. As used in this rule, "national security" means the nationaldefense and foreign relations of the United States and specifically includes:a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations;a favorable foreign relations position; or a defense posture capable of successfullyresisting hostile or destructive action from within or without, overt orcovert.DiscussionA person should not be confined as a mere matter of convenienceor expedience. 

 Some of the factors which should be consideredunder this subsection are: The nature and circumstances of the offenses charged or suspected, including extenuating circumstances;The weight of the evidence against the accused;The accused's ties to the locale, including family, off-duty employment, financial resources, and length of residence;The accused's character and mental condition;The accused's service record, including any record of previousmisconduct;The accused's record of appearance at or flight from other pretrial investigations, trials, and similar proceedings; andThe likelihood that the accused can and will commit further serious criminal misconduct if allowed to remain at liberty. 

 Although the Military Rules of Evidence are notapplicable, the commander should judge the reliability of the informationavailable. Before relying on the reports of others, the commander must havea reasonable belief that the information is believable and has a factual basis. The information may be received orally or in writing. Information need notbe received under oath, but an oath may add to its reliability. A commandermay examine the prisoner's personnel records, police records, and may considerthe recommendations of others. 

 Less serious forms of restraintmust always be considered before pretrial confinement may be approved. Thusthe commander should consider whether the prisoner could be safely returnedto the prisoner's unit, at liberty or under restriction, arrest, or conditionson liberty. _See_ R.C.M. 304.72-hour memorandum.If continued pretrial confinement is approved, the commander shall prepare a written memorandum that states the reasons for the conclusion thatthe requirements for confinement in subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule havebeen met. This memorandum may include hearsay and may incorporate by referenceother documents, such as witness statements, investigative reports, or officialrecords. This memorandum shall be forwarded to the 7-day reviewing officerunder subsection (i)(2) of this rule. If such a memorandum was prepared bythe commander before ordering confinement, a second memorandum need not be prepared; however, additional information may be added to the memorandumat any time.Procedures for review of pretrial confinement.48-hour probable cause determination.Review of the adequacy of probable cause to continue pretrial confinementshall be made by a neutral and detached officer within 48 hours of impositionof confinement under military control. If the prisoner is apprehended bycivilian authorities and remains in civilian custody at the request of militaryauthorities, reasonable efforts will be made to bring the prisoner undermilitary control in a timely fashion.7-day review of pretrial confinement.Within 7 days of the imposition of confinement, a neutral and detachedofficer appointed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretaryconcerned shall review the probable cause determination and necessity forcontinued pretrial confinement. In calculating the number of days of confinementfor purposes of this rule, the initial date of confinement under militarycontrol shall count as one day and the date of the review shall also countas one day.Nature of the 7-day review.Matters considered.The review under this subsection shall include a review of the memorandum submitted by the prisoner's commander under subsection (h)(2)(C) of this rule. Additional written matters may be considered, including any submitted by the prisoner. The prisoner and the prisoner's counsel, if any, shall be allowed to appear before the 7-day reviewing officer and make a statement, if practicable. A representative of the command may also appear before the reviewing officer to make a statement.Rules of evidence.Except for Mil. R. Evid., Section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid.302 and 305, the Military Rules of Evidence shall not apply to the mattersconsidered.Standard of proof.The requirements for confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.Victim's right to be reasonably heard.A victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the 7-day review; the right to confer with the representative of the command and counsel for the government, if any, and the right to be reasonably heard during the review. However, the hearing may not be unduly delayed for this purpose. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel. The victim of an alleged offense shall be notified of these rights in accordance with regulations of the Secretary concerned.Discussion Personal appearance by the victim is not required. A victim's right to be reasonably heard at a 7-day review may also be accomplished telephonically, by video teleconference, or by written statement.Extension of time limit.The 7-day reviewing officer may, for good cause, extend the timelimit for completion of the review to 10 days after the imposition of pretrialconfinement.Action by 7-day reviewing officer.Upon completion of review, the reviewing officer shall approve continued confinement or order immediate release. If the reviewing officer orders immediate release, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the release, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.Memorandum.The 7-day reviewing officer's conclusions, including the factual findings on which they are based, shall be set forth in a written memorandum. The memorandum shall also state whether the victim was notified of the review, was given the opportunity to confer with the representative of the command or counsel for the government, and was given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. A copy of the memorandum and all documents considered by the 7-day reviewing officer shall be maintained in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned and provided to the accused or the Government on request.Reconsideration of approval of continued confinement.The 7-day reviewing officer shall upon request, and after noticeto the parties, reconsider the decision to confine the prisoner based uponany significant information not previously considered.Review by military judge.Once the charges for which the accused has been confined are referredto trial, the military judge shall review the propriety of pretrial confinementupon motion for appropriate relief.Release. The military judge shall order release from pretrial confinementonly if:The 7-day reviewing officer's decision was an abuse of discretion,and there is not sufficient information presented to the military judge justifyingcontinuation of pretrial confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule;Information not presented to the 7-day reviewing officer establishes that the prisoner should be released under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule; orThe provisions of subsection (i)(1) or (2) of this rule have notbeen complied with and information presented to the military judge does notestablish sufficient grounds for continued confinement under subsection (h)(2)(B)of this rule.Discussion Upon a motion for release from pretrial confinement, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the motion and any hearing, the right to confer with counsel representing the government, and the right to be reasonably heard. Inability to reasonably afford a victim these rights shall not delay the proceedings. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(8).Credit.The military judge shall order administrative credit under subsection(k) of this rule for any pretrial confinement served as a result of an abuseof discretion or failure to comply with the provisions of subsections (f),(h), or (i) of this rule.Remedy.The remedy for noncompliance with subsections (f), (h), (i), or(j) of this rule shall be an administrative credit against the sentence adjudgedfor any confinement served as the result of such noncompliance. Such creditshall be computed at the rate of 1 day credit for each day of confinementserved as a result of such noncompliance. The military judge may order additionalcredit for each day of pretrial confinement that involves an abuse of discretionor unusually harsh circumstances. This credit is to be applied in additionto any other credit the accused may be entitled as a result of pretrial confinementserved. This credit shall be applied first against any confinement adjudged.If no confinement is adjudged, or if the confinement adjudged is insufficient to offset all the credit to which the accused is entitled, the credit shallbe applied against hard labor without confinement, restriction, fine, andforfeiture of pay, in that order, using the conversion formula under R.C.M. 1003(b)(6) and (7). For purposes of this subsection, 1 day of confinementshall be equal to 1 day of total forfeiture or a like amount of fine. Thecredit shall not be applied against any other form of punishment. Confinement after release.No person whose release from pretrial confinement has been directed by a person authorized in subsection (g) of this rule may be confined again before completion of trial except upon the discovery, after the order of release, of evidence or of misconduct which, either alone or in conjunction with all other available evidence, justifies confinement.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 304(b) concerning who may order confinement.Exceptions.Operational necessity.The Secretary of Defense may suspend application of subsections (e)(2) and (3), (f), (h)(2)(A) and (C), and (i) of this rule to specificunits or in specified areas when operational requirements of such units or in such areas would make application of such provisions impracticable.At sea.Subsections (e)(2) and (3), (f), (h)(2)(C), and (i) of this ruleshall not apply in the case of a person on board a vessel at sea. In suchsituations, confinement on board the vessel at sea may continue only untilthe person can be transferred to a confinement facility ashore. Such transfershall be accomplished at the earliest opportunity permitted by the operationalrequirements and mission of the vessel. Upon such transfer the memorandumrequired by subsection (h)(2)(C) of this rule shall be transmitted to thereviewing officer under subsection (i) of this rule and shall include anexplanation of any delay in the transfer.Notice to victim of escaped prisoner.A victim of an alleged offense committed by the prisoner for which the prisoner has been placed in pretrial confinement has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the escape of the prisoner, unless such notice may endanger the safety of any person.Discussion For purposes of this rule, the term "victim of an alleged offense" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ.DiscussionUnder this subsection the standards for confinement remain the same (although the circumstances giving rise to the exception could bear on theapplication of those standards). Also, pretrial confinement remains subjectto judicial review. The prisoner's commander still must determine whetherconfinement will continue under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule. The suspensionof subsection (h)(2)(A) of this rule removes the 72-hour requirement sincein a combat environment, the commander may not be available to comply withit. The commander must make the pretrial confinement decision as soon asreasonably possible, however. (This provision is not suspended under subsection(2) since the commander of a vessel is always available.)Initial dispositionWho may dispose of offenses.Each commander has discretion to dispose of offenses by membersof that command. Ordinarily the immediate commander of a person accused orsuspected of committing an offense triable by court-martial initially determineshow to dispose of that offense. A superior commander may withhold the authorityto dispose of offenses in individual cases, types of cases, or generally.A superior commander may not limit the discretion of a subordinate commanderto act on cases over which authority has not been withheld.DiscussionEach commander in the chain of command has independent, yet overlappingdiscretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that officer's authority.Normally, in keeping with the policy in subsection (b) of this rule, the initialdisposition decision is made by the official at the lowest echelon with thepower to make it. A decision by a commander ordinarily does not bar a differentdisposition by a superior authority. _See_ R.C.M. 401(c); 601(f).Once charges are referred to a court-martial by a convening authority competentto do so, they may be withdrawn from that court-martial only in accordancewith R.C.M. 604. 

 _See_ Appendix 3 with respectto offenses for which coordination with the Department of Justice is required.Policy.Allegations of offenses should be disposed of in a timely mannerat the lowest appropriate level of disposition listed in subsection (c) ofthis rule.DiscussionThe disposition decision is one of the most important and difficult decisions facing a commander. Many factors must be taken into consideration and balanced, including, to the extent practicable, the nature of the offenses, any mitigating or extenuating circumstances, the views of the victim as to disposition, any recommendations made by subordinate commanders, the interest of justice, military exigencies, and the effect of the decision on the accused and the command. The goal should be a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair.

 In deciding how an offense should be disposed of, factors the commander should consider, to the extent they are known, include:

 (A) the nature of and circumstances surrounding the offense and the extent of the harm caused by the offense, including the offense's effect on morale, health, safety, welfare, and discipline;

 (B) when applicable, the views of the victim as to disposition;

 (C) existence of jurisdiction over the accused and the offense;

 (D) availability and admissibility of evidence;

 (E) the willingness of the victim or others to testify;

 (F) cooperation of the accused in the apprehension or prosecution of another accused;

 (G) possible improper motives or biases of the person(s) making the allegation(s);

 (H) availability and likelihood of prosecution of the same or similar and related charges against the accused by another jurisdiction;

 (I) appropriateness of the authorized punishment to the particular accused or offense.How offenses may be disposed of.Within the limits of the commander's authority, a commander maytake the actions set forth in this subsection to initially dispose of a chargeor suspected offense.DiscussionPrompt disposition of charges is essential. _See_ R.C.M.707 (speedy trial requirements). 

 Before determining an appropriatedisposition, a commander should ensure that a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M.303 has been conducted. If charges have not already been preferred, the commandermay, if appropriate, prefer them and dispose of them under this rule. _But see_ R.C.M. 601 (c) regarding disqualification of an accuser. 

 Ifcharges have been preferred, the commander should ensure that the accusedhas been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308, and that charges are in properform. _ See_ R.C.M. 307. Each commander who forwards or disposesof charges may make minor changes therein. _See_ R.C.M. 603(a)and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge should be preferredanew. _See_ R.C.M. 603(d). 

 When charges arebrought against two or more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, _see_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3). If it appears that the accusedmay lack mental capacity to stand trial or may not have been mentally responsibleat the times of the offenses, _see_ R.C.M. 706; 909; 916(k).No action.A commander may decide to take no action on an offense. If charges have been preferred, they may be dismissed.DiscussionA decision to take no action or dismissal of charges at this stage does not bar later disposition of the offenses under subsection (c)(2) through (5) of this rule. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 401(a) concerningwho may dismiss charges, and R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges. 

 Whena decision is made to take no action, the accused should be informed.Administrative action.A commander may take or initiate administrative action, in addition to or instead of other action taken under this rule, subject to regulationsof the Secretary concerned. Administrative actions include corrective measuressuch as counseling, admonition, reprimand, exhortation, disapproval, criticism,censure, reproach, rebuke, extra military instruction, or the administrativewithholding of privileges, or any combination of the above.DiscussionOther administrative measures, which are subject to regulationsof the Secretary concerned, include matters related to efficiency reports,academic reports, and other ratings; rehabilitation and reassignment; careerfield reclassification; administrative reduction for inefficiency; bar toreenlistment; personnel reliability program reclassification; security classificationchanges; pecuniary liability for negligence or misconduct; and administrativeseparation.Nonjudicial punishment.A commander may consider the matter pursuant to Article 15, nonjudicialpunishment. _See_ Part V. Disposition of charges.Charges may be disposed of in accordance with R.C.M. 401.DiscussionIf charges have not been preferred, they may be preferred. _See_ R.C.M. 307 concerning preferral of charges. However, _see_ R.C.M. 601(c) concerning disqualification of an accuser. 

 Chargesmay be disposed of by dismissing them, forwarding them to another commanderfor disposition, or referring them to a summary, special, or general court-martial.Before charges may be referred to a general court-martial, compliance withR.C.M. 405 and 406 is necessary. Therefore, if appropriate, an investigation under R.C.M. 405 may be directed. Additional guidance on these matters isfound in R.C.M. 401-407.Forwarding for disposition.A commander may forward a matter concerning an offense, or charges,to a superior or subordinate authority for disposition.DiscussionThe immediate commander may lack authority to take action whichthat commander believes is an appropriate disposition. In such cases, thematter should be forwarded to a superior officer with a recommendation asto disposition. _See also_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2) concerning forwardingcharges. If allegations are forwarded to a higher authority for disposition,because of lack of authority or otherwise, the disposition decision becomes a matter within the discretion of the higher authority. 

 Amatter may be forwarded for other reasons, such as for investigation of allegationsand preferral of charges, if warranted (_see_ R.C.M. 303, 307), or so that a subordinate can dispose of the matter.National security matters.If a commander not authorized to convene general courts-martialfinds that an offense warrants trial by court-martial, but believes thattrial would be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to nationalsecurity, the matter shall be forwarded to the general court-martial conveningauthority for action under R.C.M. 407(b). Preferral of chargesWho may prefer charges.Any person subject to the code may prefer charges.DiscussionNo person may be ordered to prefer charges to which that personis unable to make truthfully the required oath. _See_ Article30(a) and subsection (b) of this rule. A person who has been the accuseror nominal accuser (_see_ Article 1(9)) may not also serveas the convening authority of a general or special court-martial to whichthe charges are later referred. _See_ Articles 22(b) and 23(b);R.C.M. 601; however, _see_ R.C.M. 1302(b) (summary court-martialconvening authority is not disqualified by being the accuser). A person authorizedto dispose of offenses (_see_ R.C.M. 306(a); 401-404and 407) should not be ordered to prefer charges when this would disqualifythat person from exercising that person's authority or would improperly restrictthat person's discretion to act on the case. _See_ R.C.M.104 and 504(c). 

 Charges may be preferred against a personsubject to trial by court-martial at any time but should be preferred withoutunnecessary delay. _See_ the statute of limitations prescribedby Article 43. Preferral of charges should not be unnecessarily delayed.When a good reason exists-as when a person is permitted to continuea course of conduct so that a ringleader or other conspirators may also bediscovered or when a suspected counterfeiter goes uncharged until guiltyknowledge becomes apparent-a reasonable delay is permissible. However, _see_ R.C.M. 707 concerning speedy trial requirements.How charges are preferred; oath.A person who prefers charges must:Sign the charges and specifications under oath before a commissioned officer of the armed forces authorized to administer oaths; andState that the signer has personal knowledge of or has investigated the matters set forth in the charges and specifications and that they aretrue in fact to the best of that person's knowledge and belief.Discussion_See_ Article 136 for authority to administer oaths.The following form may be used to administer the oath: "You (swear) (affirm) that you are a person subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, that you have personal knowledgeof or have investigated the matters set forth in the foregoing charge(s)and specification(s), and that the same are true in fact to the best of your knowledge and belief. (So help you God.)" 

 The accuser's belief may be based upon reportsof others in whole or in part.How to allege offenses.In general.The format of charge and specification is used to allege violationsof the code.Discussion_See_ Appendix 4 for a sample of a Charge Sheet (DDForm 458).Charge.A charge states the article of the code, law of war, or local penallaw of an occupied territory which the accused is alleged to have violated.DiscussionThe particular subdivision of an article of the code (for example,Article 118(1)) should not be included in the charge. When there are numerousinfractions of the same article, there will be only one charge, but severalspecifications thereunder. There may also be several charges, but each mustallege a violation of a different article of the code. For violations ofthe law of war, _see_ (D) below.Numbering charges.If there is only one charge, it is not numbered. When there ismore than one charge, each charge is numbered by a Roman numeral.Additional charges.Charges preferred after others have been preferred are labeled "additionalcharges" and are also numbered with Roman numerals, beginning with"I" if there is more than one additional charge. These ordinarilyrelate to offenses not known at the time or committed after the originalcharges were preferred. Additional charges do not require a separate trial if incorporated in the trial of the original charges before arraignment. _See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2). Preemption.An offense specifically defined by Articles 81 through 132 may notbe alleged as a violation of Article 134. _See_ paragraph60c(5)(a) of Part IV. _But see_ subsection (d) of this rule.Charges under the law of war.In the case of a person subject to trial by general court-martialfor violations of the law of war (_see_ Article 18), the chargeshould be: "Violation of the Law of War"; or "Violationof , " referring tothe local penal law of the occupied territory. _See_ R.C.M.201(f)(1)(B). _But see_ subsection (d) of this rule. Ordinarilypersons subject to the code should be charged with a specific violation ofthe code rather than a violation of the law of war.Specification.A specification is a plain, concise, and definite statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. A specification is sufficient if it alleges every element of the charged offense expressly or by necessary implication; however, specifications under Article 134 must expressly allege the terminal element. Except for aggravating factors under R.C.M 1003(d) and R.C.M. 1004, facts that increase the maximum authorized punishment must be alleged in order to permit the possible increased punishment. No particular format is required.Discussion How to draft specifications. For Article 134 offenses, also refer to paragraph 60c(6) in Part IV.Sample specifications.Before drafting a specification, the drafter should read the pertinentprovisions of Part IV, where the elements of proof of various offenses andforms for specifications appear.

--LSQP--Note: Be advised that the sample specifications in this Manual have not been amended to comport with _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010) and _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). Practitioners should read the notes above and draft specifications in conformity with the cases cited therein.--RSQP--Numbering specifications.If there is only one specification under a charge it is not numbered. When there is more than one specification under any charge, the specifications are numbered in Arabic numerals. The term "additional" is notused in connection with the specifications under an additional charge.Name and description of the accused.Name.The specification should state the accused's full name: first name,middle name or initial, last name. If the accused is known by more than onename, the name acknowledged by the accused should be used. If there is nosuch acknowledgment, the name believed to be the true name should be listedfirst, followed by all known aliases. For example: Seaman John P. Smith,U.S. Navy, alias Lt. Robert R. Brown, U.S. Navy.Military association.The specification should state the accused's rank or grade. If therank or grade of the accused has changed since the date of an alleged offense,and the change is pertinent to the offense charged, the accused should beidentified by the present rank or grade followed by rank or grade on thedate of the alleged offense. For example: In thatSeaman , then Seaman Apprentice , etc.Social security number or service number.The social security number or service number of an accused shouldnot be stated in the specification.Basis of personal jurisdiction.Military members on active duty.Ordinarily, no allegation of the accused's armed force or unit ororganization is necessary for military members on active duty.Persons subject to the code under Article 2(a), subsections (3) through (12), or subject to trial by court-martial under Articles 3 or 4.The specification should describe the accused's armed force, unitor organization, position, or status which will indicate the basis of jurisdiction.For example: John Jones, (a person employed by and serving with the U.S. Army in the field in time of war) (a person convicted of having obtained a fraudulentdischarge), etc.Date and time of offenseIn general.The date of the commission of the offense charged should be statedin the specification with sufficient precision to identify the offense andenable the accused to understand what particular act or omission to defendagainst.Use of "on or about."In alleging the date of the offense it is proper to allege it as"on or about" a specified day.Hour.The exact hour of the offense is ordinarily not alleged exceptin certain absence offenses. When the exact time is alleged, the 24-hourclock should be used. The use of "at or about" is proper.Extended periods.When the acts specified extend(s) over a considerable period oftime it is proper to allege it (or them) as having occurred, for example,"from about 15 June 1983 to about 4 November 1983," or "didon divers occasions between 15 June 1983 and 4 November 1983."Place of offense.The place of the commission of the offense charged should be statedin the specification with sufficient precision to identify the offense andenable the accused to understand the particular act or omission to defendagainst. In alleging the place of the offense, it is proper to allege itas "at or near" a certain place if the exact place is uncertain.Subject-matter jurisdiction allegations.Pleading the accused's rank or grade along with the proper elementsof the offense normally will be sufficient to establish subject-matter jurisdiction.Description of offense.Elements.The elements of the offense must be alleged, either expressly or by necessary implication, except that Article 134 specifications must expressly allege the terminal element. _See_ paragraph 60.c.(6) in Part IV. If a specific intent, knowledge, or state of mind is an element of the offense, it must be alleged.Words indicating criminality.If the alleged act is not itself an offense but is made an offenseeither by applicable statute (including Articles 133 and 134), or regulationor custom having the effect of law, then words indicating criminality suchas "wrongfully," "unlawfully," or "withoutauthority" (depending upon the nature of the offense) should be usedto describe the accused's acts.Specificity.The specification should be sufficiently specific to inform theaccused of the conduct charged, to enable the accused to prepare a defense,and to protect the accused against double jeopardy. Only those facts thatmake the accused's conduct criminal ordinarily should be alleged. Specific evidence supporting the allegations ordinarily should not be included inthe specifications.Duplicitousness.One specification should not allege more than one offense, eitherconjunctively (the accused "lost and destroyed") or alternatively(the accused "lost or destroyed"). However, if two acts or aseries of acts constitute one offense, they may be alleged conjunctively. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(5).Lesser Included Offenses.The elements of the contemplated lesser included offense should be compared with the elements of the greater offense to determine if the elements of the lesser offense are derivative of the greater offense and vice versa. _See_ discussion following paragraph 3.b.(1)(c) in Part IV and the related analysis in Appendix 23.Other considerations in drafting specifications.Principals.All principals are charged as if each was the perpetrator. _See_ paragraph 1 of Part IV for a discussion of principals.Victim.In the case of an offense against the person or property of a person,the first name, middle initial and last name of such person should be alleged,if known. If the name of the victim is unknown, a general physical descriptionmay be used. If this cannot be done, the victim may be described as "aperson whose name is unknown." Military rank or grade should be alleged,and must be alleged if an element of the offense, as in an allegation ofdisobedience of the command of a superior officer. If the person has no militaryposition, it may otherwise be necessary to allege the status as in an allegationof using provoking words toward a person subject to the code. _ See_ paragraph 42 of Part IV.Property.In describing property generic terms should be used, such as "awatch" or "a knife," and descriptive details such as make,model, color, and serial number should ordinarily be omitted. In some instances,however, details may be essential to the offense, so they must be alleged.For example: the length of a knife blade may be important when alleging aviolation of general regulation prohibiting carrying a knife with a bladethat exceeds a certain length.Value.When the value of property or other amount determines the maximumpunishment which may be adjudged for an offense, the value or amount shouldbe alleged, for in such a case increased punishments that are contingentupon value may not be adjudged unless there is an allegation, as well asproof, of a value which will support the punishment. If several articlesof different kinds are the subject of the offense, the value of each articleshould be stated followed by a statement of the aggregate value. Exact valueshould be stated, if known. For ease of proof an allegation may be "ofa value not less than ." If only an approximatevalue is known, it may be alleged as "of a value of about ." If the value of an item is unknown but obviously minimal,the term "of some value" may be used. These principles apply toallegations of amounts.Documents.When documents other than regulations or orders must be alleged(for example, bad checks in violation of Article 123a), the document maybe set forth verbatim (including photocopies and similar reproductions) ormay be described, in which case the description must be sufficient to informthe accused of the offense charged.Orders.General orders.A specification alleging a violation of a general order or regulation(Article 92(1)) must clearly identify the specific order or regulation allegedlyviolated. The general order or regulation should be cited by its identifyingtitle or number, section or paragraph, and date. It is not necessary to recitethe text of the general order or regulation verbatim.Other orders.If the order allegedly violated is an "other lawful order"(Article 92(2)), it should be set forth verbatim or described in the specification.When the order is oral, _see_ (vii) below.Negating exceptions.If the order contains exceptions, it is not necessary that the specificationcontain a specific allegation negating the exceptions. However, words ofcriminality may be required if the alleged act is not necessarily criminal. _See_ subsection (G)(ii) of this discussion.Oral statements.When alleging oral statements the phrase "or words to thateffect" should be added.Joint offense.In the case of a joint offense each accused may be charged separatelyas if each accused acted alone or all may be charged together in a singlespecification. For example:If Doe and Roe are joint perpetrators of an offense and it is intendedto charge and try both at the same trial, they should be charged in a singlespecification as follows: 

 "Inthat Doe and Roe, acting jointly and pursuant to a common intent, did.--PUNCSP--.--PUNCSP--.--PUNCSP--."If it is intended that Roe will be tried alone or that Roe willbe tried with Doe at a common trial, Roe may be charged in the same manneras if Roe alone had committed the offense. However, to show in the specificationthat Doe was a joint actor with Roe, even though Doe is not to be tried withRoe, Roe may be charged as follows: 

 "Inthat Roe did, in conjunction with Doe, .--PUNCSP--.--PUNCSP--.--PUNCSP--."Matters in aggravation.Matters in aggravation that do not increase the maximum authorizedpunishment ordinarily should not be alleged in the specification. Prior convictionsneed not be alleged in the specification to permit increased punishment.Aggravating factors in capital cases should not be alleged in the specification. Notice of such factors is normally provided in accordance with R.C.M. 1004(b)(1).Abbreviations.Commonly used and understood abbreviations may be used, particularly abbreviations for ranks, grades, units and organizations, components, and geographic or political entities, such as the names of states or countries.Multiple offenses.Charges and specifications alleging all known offenses by an accused may be preferred at the same time. Each specification shall state only one offense. What is substantially one transaction should not be made the basis for an unreasonable multiplication of charges against one person. Unreasonable multiplication of charges is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12); multiplicity is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B); and punishment limitations are addressed in R.C.M. 1003(c)(1)(C).DiscussionThe prohibition against unreasonable multiplication of charges addresses those features of military law that increase the potential for overreaching in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is based on reasonableness, and has no foundation in Constitutional rights. To determine if charges are unreasonably multiplied, see R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Because prosecutors are free to plead in the alternative, it may be reasonable to charge two or more offenses that arise from one transaction if sufficient doubt exists as to the facts or the law. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included offense thereof be separately charged. See also Part IV, paragraph 3, and R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.

 _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12) and 1003(c)(1)(C). For example, a person should not be charged with both failure to report for a routine scheduled duty,such as reveille, and with absence without leave if the failure to reportoccurred during the period for which the accused is charged with absence without leave. There are times, however, when sufficient doubt as to the facts orthe law exists to warrant making one transaction the basis for charging twoor more offenses. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included offense thereof be separately charged. 

 _See also_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.Multiple offenders.A specification may name more than one person as an accused if eachperson so named is believed by the accuser to be a principal in the offensewhich is the subject of the specification.Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 601(e)(3) concerning joinder ofaccused. 

 A joint offense is one committed by two or morepersons acting together with a common intent. Principals may be charged jointlywith the commission of the same offense, but an accessory after the factcannot be charged jointly with the principal whom the accused is alleged tohave received, comforted, or assisted. Offenders are properly joined onlyif there is a common unlawful design or purpose; the mere fact that severalpersons happen to have committed the same kinds of offenses at the time, althoughmaterial as tending to show concert of purpose, does not necessarily establishthis. The fact that several persons happen to have absented themselves withoutleave at about the same time will not, in the absence of evidence indicatinga joint design, purpose, or plan justify joining them in one specification,for they may merely have been availing themselves of the same opportunity.In joint offenses the participants may be separately or jointly charged.However, if the participants are members of different armed forces, they mustbe charged separately because their trials must be separately reviewed. Thepreparation of joint charges is discussed in subsection (c)(3) Discussion(H) (viii)_(a)_ of this rule. The advantage of a joint charge is that all accused will be tried at one trial, thereby saving time, labor,and expense. This must be weighed against the possible unfairness to theaccused which may result if their defenses are inconsistent or antagonistic. An accused cannot be called as a witness except upon that accused's own request.If the testimony of an accomplice is necessary, the accomplice should notbe tried jointly with those against whom the accomplice is expected to testify. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 306. 

 _See_ R.C.M.603 concerning amending specifications. 

 _See_ R.C.M.906(b)(5) and (6) concerning motions to amend specifications and bills ofparticulars.Harmless error in citation.Error in or omission of the designation of the article of the codeor other statute, law of war, or regulation violated shall not be groundfor dismissal of a charge or reversal of a conviction if the error or omissiondid not prejudicially mislead the accused. Notification to accused of chargesImmediate commander.The immediate commander of the accused shall cause the accused tobe informed of the charges preferred against the accused, and the name ofthe person who preferred the charges and of any person who ordered the chargesto be preferred, if known, as soon as practicable.DiscussionWhen notice is given, a certificate to that effect on the ChargeSheet should be completed. _See_ Appendix 4.Commanders at higher echelons.When the accused has not been informed of the charges, commandersat higher echelons to whom the preferred charges are forwarded shall causethe accused to be informed of the matters required under subsection (a) ofthis rule as soon as practicable. Remedy.The sole remedy for violation of this rule is a continuance or recessof sufficient length to permit the accused to adequately prepare a defense,and no relief shall be granted upon a failure to comply with this rule unlessthe accused demonstrates that the accused has been hindered in the preparationof a defense. FORWARDING AND DISPOSITION OF CHARGESForwarding and disposition of charges in generalWho may dispose of charges.Only persons authorized to convene courts-martial or to administernonjudicial punishment under Article 15 may dispose of charges. A superiorcompetent authority may withhold the authority of a subordinate to dispose of charges in individual cases, types of cases, or generally.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 504 as to who may convene courts-martialand paragraph 2 of Part V as to who may administer nonjudicial punishment.If the power to convene courts-martial and to administer nonjudicial punishment has been withheld, a commander may not dispose of charges under this rule. 

 Ordinarilycharges should be forwarded to the accused's immediate commander for initialconsideration as to disposition. Each commander has independent discretionto determine how charges will be disposed of, except to the extent that thecommander's authority has been withheld by superior competent authority. _See also_ R.C.M. 104. 

 Each commander who forwardsor disposes of charges may make minor changes therein. _See_ R.C.M.603(a) and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge shouldbe preferred anew. _See_ R.C.M. 603(d). If a commander is anaccuser (_see_ Article 1(9); 307(a)) that commander is ineligibleto refer such charges to a general or special court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 601(c). However, see R.C.M. 1302(b) (accuser may refer charges to a summarycourt-martial).Prompt determination.When a commander with authority to dispose of charges receives charges,that commander shall promptly determine what disposition will be made inthe interest of justice and discipline.DiscussionIn determining what level of disposition is appropriate, _see_ R.C.M. 306(b) and (c). When charges are brought against twoor more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, _see_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3). If it appears that the accused may lack mental capacityto stand trial or may not have been mentally responsible at the times ofthe offenses, _see_ R.C.M. 706; 909; 916(k). 

 Asto the rules concerning speedy trial, _see_ R.C.M. 707. _See also_ Articles 10; 30; 33; 98. 

 Before determiningan appropriate disposition, a commander who receives charges should ensurethat: (1) a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M. 303 has been conducted; (2) theaccused has been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308; and (3) the chargesare in proper form.How charges may be disposed of.Unless the authority to do so has been limited or withheld by superiorcompetent authority, a commander may dispose of charges by dismissing anyor all of them, forwarding any or all of them to another commander for disposition,or referring any or all of them to a court-martial which the commander isempowered to convene. Charges should be disposed of in accordance with thepolicy in R.C.M. 306(b).DiscussionA commander may dispose of charges individually or collectively.If charges are referred to a court-martial, ordinarily all known chargesshould be referred to a single court-martial. 

 _See_ Appendix 3 when the charges may involve matters in which the Departmentof Justice has an interest.Dismissal.When a commander dismisses charges further disposition under R.C.M.306(c) of the offenses is not barred.DiscussionCharges are ordinarily dismissed by lining out and initialing thedeleted specifications or otherwise recording that a specification is dismissed.When all charges and specifications are dismissed, the accuser and the accusedordinarily should be informed. 

 A charge should be dismissedwhen it fails to state an offense, when it is unsupported by available evidence,or when there are other sound reasons why trial by court-martial is not appropriate. Before dismissing charges because trial would be detrimental to the prosecutionof a war or harmful to national security, _see_ R.C.M. 401(d);407(b). 

 If the accused has already refused nonjudicial punishment,charges should not be dismissed with a view to offering nonjudicial punishmentunless the accused has indicated willingness to accept nonjudicial punishmentif again offered. The decision whether to dismiss charges in such circumstancesis within the sole discretion of the commander concerned. 

 Chargesmay be amended in accordance with R.C.M. 603. 

 It is appropriateto dismiss a charge and prefer another charge anew when, for example, theoriginal charge failed to state an offense, or was so defective that a majoramendment was required (_see_ R.C.M. 603(d)), or did not adequatelyreflect the nature or seriousness of the offense. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C) concerning the effect of dismissing chargesafter the court-martial has begun.Forwarding charges.Forwarding to a superior commander.When charges are forwarded to a superior commander for disposition,the forwarding commander shall make a personal recommendation as to disposition.If the forwarding commander is disqualified from acting as convening authorityin the case, the basis for the disqualification shall be noted.DiscussionA commander's recommendation is within that commander's sole discretion.No authority may direct a commander to make a specific recommendation asto disposition. 

 When charges are forwarded to a superiorcommander with a view to trial by general or special court-martial, theyshould be forwarded by a letter of transmittal or indorsement. To the extentpracticable without unduly delaying forwarding the charges, the letter shouldinclude or carry as enclosures: a summary of the available evidence relatingto each offense; evidence of previous convictions and nonjudicial punishments of the accused; an indication that the accused has been offered and refusednonjudicial punishment, if applicable; and any other matters required bysuperior authority or deemed appropriate by the forwarding commander. Othermatters which may be appropriate include information concerning the accused'sbackground and character of military service, and a description of any unusualcircumstances in the case. The summary of evidence should include availablewitness statements, documentary evidence, and exhibits. When practicable,copies of signed statements of the witnesses should be forwarded, as shouldcopies of any investigative or laboratory reports. Forwarding charges shouldnot be delayed, however, solely to obtain such statements or reports whenit otherwise appears that sufficient evidence to warrant trial is or willbe available in time for trial. If because of the bulk of documents or exhibits,it is impracticable to forward them with the letter of transmittal, theyshould be properly preserved and should be referred to in the letter of transmittal. 

 Whenit appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings inthe case or that a deposition may be appropriate, that matter should be broughtto the attention of the convening authority promptly and should be notedin the letter of transmittal. 

 When charges are forwardedwith a view to disposition other than trial by general or special court-martial,they should be accompanied by sufficient information to enable the authorityreceiving them to dispose of them without further investigation.Other cases.When charges are forwarded to a commander who is not a superiorof the forwarding commander, no recommendation as to disposition may be made.DiscussionExcept when directed to forward charges, a subordinate commandermay not be required to take any specific action to dispose of charges. _See_ R.C.M. 104. _See also_ paragraph 1d(2) of PartV. When appropriate, charges may be sent or returned to a subordinate commanderfor compliance with procedural requirements. _See_, for example,R.C.M. 303 (preliminary inquiry); R.C.M. 308 (notification to accused of charges).Referral of charges._See_ R.C.M. 403, 404, 407, 601. National security matters.If a commander who is not a general court-martial convening authorityfinds that the charges warrant trial by court-martial but believes that trialwould probably be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to nationalsecurity, the charges shall be forwarded to the officer exercising generalcourt-martial convening authority.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 407(b).Action by commander not authorized to convene courts-martialWhen in receipt of charges, a commander authorized to administernonjudicial punishment but not authorized to convene courts-martial may:Dismiss any charges; orDiscussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,the effect of dismissal, and options for further action.Forward them to a superior commander for disposition.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2) for additional guidance concerning forwarding charges. _See generally_ R.C.M. 303 (preliminaryinquiry); 308 (notification to accused of charges) concerning other dutiesof the immediate commander when in receipt of charges. 

 Whenthe immediate commander is authorized to convene courts-martial, _see_ R.C.M. 403, 404, or 407, as appropriate.Action by commander exercising summary court-martial jurisdictionRecording receipt.Immediately upon receipt of sworn charges, an officer exercisingsummary court-martial jurisdiction over the command shall cause the hourand date of receipt to be entered on the charge sheet.Discussion_See_ Article 24 and R.C.M. 1302(a) concerning whomay exercise summary court-martial jurisdiction. 

 The entryindicating receipt is important because it stops the running of the statuteof limitations. _See_ Article 43; R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B). Chargesmay be preferred and forwarded to an officer exercising summary court-martialjurisdiction over the command to stop the running of the statute of limitationseven though the accused is absent without authority.Disposition.When in receipt of charges a commander exercising summary court-martialjurisdiction may: Dismiss any charges;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,the effect of dismissing charges, and options for further action.Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to asubordinate commander for disposition; Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding chargesto a subordinate. When appropriate, charges may be forwarded to a subordinateeven if the subordinate previously considered them.Forward any charges to a superior commander for disposition;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(A) for guidance concerningforwarding charges to a superior.Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a summary court-martialfor trial; orDiscussion_See_ R.C.M. 1302(c) concerning referral of chargesto a summary court-martial.Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct apretrial investigation under R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward thereport of investigation with the charges to a superior commander for disposition.DiscussionAn investigation should be directed when it appears that the chargesare of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _See_ R.C.M. 405. If an investigation of the subject matter alreadyhas been conducted, _see_ R.C.M. 405(b).Action by commander exercising special court-martial jurisdictionWhen in receipt of charges, a commander exercising special court-martialjurisdiction may: Dismiss any charges;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of charges,the effect of dismissing charges, and options for further action.Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a subordinate commander for disposition; Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding chargesto a subordinate.

 _See_ R.C.M.601 concerning referral of charges to a special court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 1302(c) concerning referral of charges to a summary court-martial.Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, direct a preliminary hearing under R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward the report of preliminary hearing with the charges to a superior commander for disposition.Discussion A preliminary hearing should be directed when it appears that the charges are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. _See_ R.C.M. 405. If a preliminary hearing of the subject matter already has been conducted, see R.C.M. 405(b) and 405(e)(2).Disclosure of matters following direction of preliminary hearingWhen a convening authority directs a preliminary hearing under R.C.M. 405, counsel forthe government shall, subject to R.C.M. 404A(b)-(d) below, within 5 days of issuance of the Article 32 appointing order, provide to the defense the following information or matters:Charge sheet;Article 32 appointing order;Documents accompanying the charge sheet on which the preferral decision was based;Documents provided to the convening authority when deciding to direct the preliminary hearing;Documents the counsel for the government intends to present at the preliminary hearing; andAccess to tangible objects counsel for the government intends to present at the preliminary hearing.Contraband.If items covered by subsection 404A(a) above are contraband, the disclosure required under this rule is a reasonable opportunity to inspect said contraband prior to the hearing.Privilege.If items covered by subsection 404A(a) above are privileged, classified or otherwise protected under Section V of Part III, no disclosure of those items is required under this rule. However, counsel for the government may disclose privileged, classified, or otherwise protected information covered by subsection 404A(a) above if authorized by the holder of the privilege, or in the case of Mil. R. Evid. 505 or 506, if authorized by a competent authority.Protective order if privileged information is disclosed.If the government agrees to disclose to the accused information to which the protections afforded by Section V of Part III may apply, the convening authority, or other person designated by regulation of the Secretary concerned, may enter an appropriate protective order, in writing, to guard against the compromise of information disclosed to the accused. The terms of any such protective order may include prohibiting the disclosure of the information except as authorized by the authority issuing the protective order, as well as those terms specified by Mil. R. Evid. 505(g)(2)-(6) or 506(g)(2)(5).Discussion The purposes of this rule are to provide the accused with the documents used to make the determination to prefer charges and direct a preliminary hearing, and to allow the accused to prepare for the preliminary hearing. This rule is not intended to be a tool for discovery and does not impose the same discovery obligations found in R.C.M. 405 prior to amendments required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 or R.C.M. 701. Additional rules for disclosure of witnesses and other evidence in the preliminary hearing are provided in R.C.M. 405(g).Preliminary hearingIn general.Except as provided in subsection (k) of this rule, no charge or specification may be referred to a general court-martial for trial until completion of a preliminary hearing in substantial compliance with this rule. A preliminary hearing conducted under this rule is not intended to serve as a means of discovery and will be limited to an examination of those issues necessary to determine whether there is probable cause to conclude that an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it; to determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; to consider the form of the charge(s); and to recommend the disposition that should be made of the charge(s). Failure to comply with this rule shall have no effect on the disposition of the charge(s) if the charge(s) is not referred to a general court-martial.Discussion The function of the preliminary hearing is to ascertain and impartially weigh the facts needed for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing is not intended to perfect a case against the accused and is not intended to serve as a means of discovery or to provide a right of confrontation required at trial. Determinations and recommendations of the preliminary hearing officer are advisory.

 Failure to substantially comply with the requirements of Article 32, which failure prejudices the accused, may result in delay in disposition of the case or disapproval of the proceedings. See R.C.M. 905(b)(1) and 906(b)(3) concerning motions for appropriate relief relating to the preliminary hearing.

 The accused may waive the preliminary hearing. See subsection (k) of this rule. In such case, no preliminary hearing need be held. However, the convening authority authorized to direct the preliminary hearing may direct that it be conducted notwithstanding the waiver.Earlier preliminary hearing.If a preliminary hearing of the subject matter of an offense has been conducted before the accused is charged with an offense, and the accused was present at the preliminary hearing and afforded the rights to counsel, cross-examination, and presentation of evidence required by this rule, no further preliminary hearing is required. Who may direct a preliminary hearing.Unless prohibited by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a preliminary hearing may be directed under this rule by any court-martial convening authority. That authority may also give procedural instructions not inconsistent with these rules. Personnel.Preliminary hearing officer.Whenever practicable, the convening authority directing a preliminary hearing under this rule shall detail an impartial judge advocate certified under Article 27(b), not the accuser, as a preliminary hearing officer, who shall conduct the preliminary hearing and make a report that addresses whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense or offenses have been committed and that the accused committed the offense(s); whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; the form of the charges(s); and a recommendation as to the disposition of the charge(s).

 When the appointment of a judge advocate as the preliminary hearing officer is not practicable, or in exceptional circumstances in which the interest of justice warrants, the convening authority directing the preliminary hearing may detail an impartial commissioned officer, who is not the accuser, as the preliminary hearing officer. If the preliminary hearing officer is not a judge advocate, an impartial judge advocate certified under Article 27(b) shall be available to provide legal advice to the preliminary hearing officer.

 When practicable, the preliminary hearing officer shall be equal or senior in grade to the military counsel detailed to represent the accused and the government at the preliminary hearing. The Secretary concerned may prescribe additional limitations on the appointment of preliminary hearing officers.

 The preliminary hearing officer shall not depart from an impartial role and become an advocate for either side. The preliminary hearing officer is disqualified to act later in the same case in any other capacity.Discussion The preliminary hearing officer, if not a judge advocate, should be an officer in the grade of O-4 or higher. The preliminary hearing officer may seek legal advice concerning the preliminary hearing officer's responsibilities from an impartial source, but may not obtain such advice from counsel for any party or counsel for a victim.Counsel to represent the United States.A judge advocate, not the accuser, shall serve as counsel to represent the United States, and shall present evidence on behalf of the government relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing as set forth in subsection (a) of this rule.Defense counsel.The commander who directed the investigation may also, as a matterof discretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail:Detailed counsel.Except as provided in subsection (d)(3)(B) of this rule, military counsel certified in accordance with Article 27(b) shall be detailed to represent the accused. Individual military counsel.The accused may request to be represented by individual military counsel. Such requests shall be acted on in accordance with R.C.M. 506(b). Civilian counsel.The accused may be represented by civilian counsel at no expense to the United States. Upon request, the accused is entitled to a reasonable time to obtain civilian counsel and to have such counsel present for the preliminary hearing. However, the preliminary hearing shall not be unduly delayed for this purpose. Representation by civilian counsel shall not limit the rights to military counsel under subsections (d)(3)(A) and (B) of this rule. Others.The convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing may also, as a matter of discretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail:A reporter; and An interpreter. Scope of preliminary hearing.The preliminary hearing officer shall limit the inquiry to the examination of evidence, including witnesses, necessary to:Determine whether there is probable cause to believe an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it;Determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused;Consider whether the form of the charge(s) is proper; andMake a recommendation as to the disposition of the charge(s). If evidence adduced during the preliminary hearing indicates that the accused committed any uncharged offense(s), the preliminary hearing officer may examine evidence and hear witnesses relating to the subject matter of such offense(s) and make the findings and recommendations enumerated in subsection (e)(1) of this rule regarding such offense(s) without the accused first having been charged with the offense. The accused's rights under subsection (f)(2) of this rule, and, where it would not cause undue delay to the proceedings, subsection (g) of this rule, are the same with regard to both charged and uncharged offenses. When considering uncharged offenses identified during the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing officer shall inform the accused of the general nature of each uncharged offense considered, and otherwise afford the accused the same opportunity for representation, cross examination, and presentation afforded during the preliminary hearing of any charged offense.Discussion Except as set forth in subsection (h) below, the Mil. R. Evid. do not apply at a preliminary hearing. Except as prohibited elsewhere in this rule, a preliminary hearing officer may consider evidence, including hearsay, which would not be admissible at trial.Rights of the accused.Prior to any preliminary hearing under this rule the accused shall have the right to:Notice of any witnesses that the government intends to call at the preliminary hearing and copies of or access to any written or recorded statements made by those witnesses that relate to the subject matter of any charged offense; For purposes of this rule, a "written statement" is one that is signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government; andFor purposes of this rule, a "recorded statement" is an oral statement made by the witness that is recorded contemporaneously with the making of the oral statement and contained in a digital or other recording or a transcription thereof that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government. Notice of, and reasonable access to, any other evidence that the government intends to offer at the preliminary hearing; andNotice of, and reasonable access to, evidence that is within the possession or control of counsel for the government that negates or reduces the degree of guilt of the accused for an offense charged.At any preliminary hearing under this rule the accused shall have the right to:Be advised of the charges under consideration;Be represented by counsel;Be informed of the purpose of the preliminary hearing;Be informed of the right against self-incrimination under Article 31;Except in the circumstances described in R.C.M. 804(c)(2), be present throughout the taking of evidence;Cross-examine witnesses on matters relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing;Present matters in defense and mitigation relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing; andDiscussion Unsworn statements by the accused, unlike those made under R.C.M. 1001(c)(2), shall be limited to matters in defense and mitigation.Make a statement relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.Production of Witnesses and Other Evidence.Military Witnesses.Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government the names of proposed military witnesses whom the accused requests that the government produce to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the requested form of the testimony, in accordance with the timeline established by the preliminary hearing officer. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and will seek to secure the witness's testimony for the hearing; or (2) the government objects to the proposed defense witness on the grounds that the testimony would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.If the government objects to the proposed defense witness, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. If the government does not object to the proposed defense military witness or the preliminary hearing officer determines that the military witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary, counsel for the government shall request that the commanding officer of the proposed military witness make that person available to provide testimony. The commanding officer shall determine whether the individual is available based on operational necessity or mission requirements, except that a victim, as defined in this rule, who declines to testify shall be deemed to be not available. If the commanding officer determines that the military witness is available, counsel for the government shall make arrangements for that individual's testimony. The commanding officer's determination of unavailability due to operational necessity or mission requirements is final. The military witness's commanding officer determines the availability of the witness and, if there is a dispute among the parties, determines whether the witness testifies in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony.Discussion A commanding officer's determination of whether an individual is available, as well as the means by which the individual is available, is a balancing test. The more important the testimony of the witness, the greater the difficulty, expense, delay, or effect on military operations must be to deny production of the witness. Based on operational necessity and mission requirements, the witness's commanding officer may authorize the witness to testify by video teleconference, telephone, or similar means of remote testimony. Factors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; and the likelihood of significant interference with operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.Civilian Witnesses.Military witnesses.Defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government the names of proposed civilian witnesses whom the accused requests that the government produce to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the requested form of the testimony, in accordance with the timeline established by the preliminary hearing officer. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and will seek to secure the witness's testimony for the hearing; or (2) the government objects to the proposed defense witness on the grounds that the testimony would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.If the government objects to the proposed defense witness, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the witness is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.Evidence generally.If the government does not object to the proposed civilian witness or the preliminary hearing officer determines that the civilian witness's testimony is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary, counsel for the government shall invite the civilian witness to provide testimony and, if the individual agrees, shall make arrangements for that witness's testimony. If expense to the government is to be incurred, the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, or the convening authority's delegate, shall determine whether the witness testifies in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony.Discussion Factors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-person testimony. Civilian witnesses may not be compelled to provide testimony at a preliminary hearing. Civilian witnesses may be paid for travel and associated expenses to testify at a preliminary hearing. _See_ Department of Defense Joint Travel Regulations.Other evidence.Evidence under the control of the government.Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government a list of evidence under the control of the government the accused requests the government produce to the defense for introduction at the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer may set a deadline by which defense requests must be received. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the evidence; or (2) the government objects to production of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.If the government objects to production of the evidence, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the evidence should be produced. The preliminary hearing officer shall determine whether the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the hearing. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that the evidence shall be produced, counsel for the government shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the evidence.Evidence not under the control of the government.Evidence not under the control of the government may be obtained through noncompulsory means or by _subpoenas duces tecum_ issued by counsel for the government in accordance with the process established by R.C.M. 703.Prior to the preliminary hearing, defense counsel shall provide to counsel for the government a list of evidence not under the control of the government that the accused requests the government obtain. The preliminary hearing officer may set a deadline by which defense requests must be received. Counsel for the government shall respond that either: (1) the government agrees that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ for the evidence; or (2) the government objects to production of the evidence on the grounds that the evidence would be irrelevant, cumulative, or unnecessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. If the government objects to production of the evidence, defense counsel may request that the preliminary hearing officer determine whether the evidence should be produced. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that the evidence is relevant, not cumulative, and necessary based on the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing and that the issuance of _subpoenas duces tecum_ would not cause undue delay to the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing officer shall direct counsel for the government to issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ for the defense-requested evidence. Failure on the part of counsel for the government to issue _subpoenas duces tecum_ directed by the preliminary hearing officer shall be noted by the preliminary hearing officer in the report of preliminary hearing.Discussion A _subpoena duces tecum_ to produce books, papers, documents, data, electronically stored information, or other objects for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 may be issued by counsel for the government. The preliminary hearing officer has no authority to issue a _subpoena duces tecum_. However, the preliminary hearing officer may direct counsel for the government to issue a _subpoena duces tecum_ for defense-requested evidence.Military Rules of Evidence.The Military Rules of Evidence do not apply in preliminary hearings under this rule except as follows:Mil. R. Evid. 301-303 and 305 shall apply in their entirety.Mil. R. Evid. 412 shall apply in any case that includes a charge defined as a sexual offense in Mil. R. Evid. 412(d), except that Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) shall not apply.Mil. R. Evid., Section V, Privileges, shall apply, except that Mil. R. Evid. 505(f)-(h) and (j); 506(f)-(h), (j), (k), and (m); and 514(d)(6) shall not apply.In applying these rules to a preliminary hearing, the term "military judge," as used in these rules, shall mean the preliminary hearing officer, who shall assume the military judge's authority to exclude evidence from the preliminary hearing, and who shall, in discharging this duty, follow the procedures set forth in the rules cited in subsections (h)(1)-(3) of this rule. However, the preliminary hearing officer is not authorized to order production of communications covered by Mil. R. Evid. 513 and 514.Discussion The prohibition against ordering production of evidence does not preclude a preliminary hearing officer from considering evidence offered by the parties under Mil. R. Evid. 513 or 514.Failure to meet the procedural requirements of the applicable rules of evidence shall result in exclusion of that evidence from the preliminary hearing, unless good cause is shown.Discussion Before considering evidence offered under subsection (h)(2), the preliminary hearing officer must determine that the evidence offered is relevant for the limited scope and purpose of the hearing, that the evidence is proper under subsection (h)(2), and that the probative value of such evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the alleged victim's privacy. The preliminary hearing officer shall set forth any limitations on the scope of such evidence.

 Evidence offered under subsection (h)(2) above must be protected pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. --SECT-- 552a. Although Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) allows admission of evidence of the victim's sexual behavior or predisposition at trial when it is constitutionally required, there is no constitutional requirement at an Article 32 hearing. There is likewise no constitutional requirement for a pretrial hearing officer to consider evidence under Mil. R. Evid. 514(d)(6) at an Article 32 hearing. Evidence deemed admissible by the preliminary hearing officer should be made a part of the report of preliminary hearing. _See_ subsection (j)(2)(C), _infra_. Evidence not considered, and the testimony taken during a closed hearing, should not be included in the report of preliminary hearing but should be appropriately safeguarded or sealed. The preliminary hearing officer and counsel representing the government are responsible for careful handling of any such evidence to prevent unauthorized viewing or disclosure.Procedure.Generally. The preliminary hearing shall begin with the preliminary hearing officer informing the accused of the accused's rights under subsection (f) of this rule. Counsel for the government will then present evidence. Upon the conclusion of counsel for the government's presentation of evidence, defense counsel may present matters in defense and mitigation consistent with subsection (f) of this rule. For the purposes of this rule, "matters in mitigation" are defined as matters that may serve to explain the circumstances surrounding a charged offense. Both counsel for the government and defense shall be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The preliminary hearing officer may also question witnesses called by the parties. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that additional evidence is necessary to satisfy the requirements of subsection (e) above, the preliminary hearing officer may provide the parties an opportunity to present additional testimony or evidence relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer shall not consider evidence not presented at the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing officer shall not call witnesses _sua sponte_.Discussion A preliminary hearing officer may only consider evidence within the limited purpose of the preliminary hearing and shall ensure that the scope of the hearing is limited to that purpose. When the preliminary hearing officer finds that evidence offered by either party is not within the scope of the hearing, he shall inform the parties and halt the presentation of that information.Notice to and presence of the victim(s).The victim(s) of an offense under the UCMJ has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of a preliminary hearing relating to the alleged offense and the reasonable right to confer with counsel for the government. For the purposes of this rule, a "victim" is a person who is alleged to have suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the matters set forth in a charge or specification under consideration and is named in one of the specifications under consideration. A victim of an offense under consideration at the preliminary hearing is not required to testify at the preliminary hearing.A victim has the right not to be excluded from any portion of a preliminary hearing related to the alleged offense, unless the preliminary hearing officer, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines the testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at the proceeding.A victim shall be excluded if a privilege set forth in Mil. R. Evid. 505 or 506 is invoked or if evidence is offered under Mil. R. Evid. 412, 513, or 514, for charges other than those in which the victim is named.Presentation of evidence. Testimony. Witness testimony may be provided in person, by video teleconference, by telephone, or by similar means of remote testimony. All testimony shall be taken under oath, except that the accused may make an unsworn statement. The preliminary hearing officer shall only consider testimony that is relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.Discussion The following oath may be given to witnesses:

"Do you (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you God)?"

 The preliminary hearing officer is required to include in the report of the preliminary hearing, at a minimum, a summary of the substance of all testimony. See subsection (j)(2)(B) of this rule.

 All preliminary hearing officer notes of testimony and recordings of testimony should be preserved until the end of trial.

 If during the preliminary hearing any witness subject to the Code is suspected of an offense under the Code, the preliminary hearing officer should comply with the warning requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 305(c), (d), and, if necessary, (e).

 Bearing in mind that counsel are responsible for preparing and presenting their cases, the preliminary hearing officer may ask a witness questions relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the hearing. When questioning a witness, the preliminary hearing officer may not depart from an impartial role and become an advocate for either side.Other evidence. If relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing, and not cumulative, a preliminary hearing officer may consider other evidence, in addition to or in lieu of witness testimony, including statements, tangible evidence, or reproductions thereof, offered by either side, that the preliminary hearing officer determines is reliable. This other evidence need not be sworn.Access by spectators. Access by spectators to all or part of the proceedings may be restricted or foreclosed in the discretion of the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing or the preliminary hearing officer. Preliminary hearings are public proceedings and should remain open to the public whenever possible. When an overriding interest exists that outweighs the value of an open preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing may be closed to spectators. Any closure must be narrowly tailored to achieve the overriding interest that justified the closure. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conclude that no lesser methods short of closing the preliminary hearing can be used to protect the overriding interest in the case. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conduct a case-by-case, witness-by-witness, circumstance-by-circumstance analysis of whether closure is necessary. If a convening authority or preliminary hearing officer believes closing the preliminary hearing is necessary, the convening authority or preliminary hearing officer must make specific findings of fact in writing that support the closure. The written findings of fact must be included in the report of preliminary hearing. Examples of overriding interests may include: preventing psychological harm or trauma to a child witness or an alleged victim of a sexual crime, protecting the safety or privacy of a witness or alleged victim, protecting classified material, and receiving evidence where a witness is incapable of testifying in an open setting. Presence of accused. The further progress of the taking of evidence shall not be prevented and the accused shall be considered to have waived the right to be present whenever the accused: After being notified of the time and place of the proceeding is voluntarily absent; or After being warned by the preliminary hearing officer that disruptive conduct will cause removal from the proceeding, persists in conduct which is such as to justify exclusion from the proceeding. Recording of the preliminary hearing. Counsel for the government shall ensure that the preliminary hearing is recorded by a suitable recording device. A victim, as defined by subsection (i)(2)(A) of this rule, may request access to, or a copy of, the recording of the proceedings. Upon request, counsel for the government shall provide the requested access to, or a copy of, the recording to the victim not later than a reasonable time following dismissal of the charges, unless charges are dismissed for the purpose of re-referral, or court-martial adjournment. A victim is not entitled to classified information or access to or a copy of a recording of closed sessions which the victim did not have the right to attend under subsections (i)(2)(C) or (i)(2)(D) of this rule. DiscussionCounsel for the government shall provide victims with access to, or a copy of, the recording of the proceedings in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe.Objections. Any objection alleging failure to comply with this rule shall be made to the convening authority via the preliminary hearing officer. Sealed exhibits and proceedings.

That convening authority shall promptly cause a copy of the report to be delivered to each accused. Objections.Any objection to the report shall be made to the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, via the preliminary hearing officer, within 5 days of its receipt by the accused. This subsection does not prohibit a convening authority from referring the charge(s) or taking other action within the 5-day period. Waiver.The accused may waive a preliminary hearing under this rule. In addition, failure to make a timely objection under this rule, including an objection to the report, shall constitute waiver of the objection. Relief from the waiver may be granted by the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing, a superior convening authority, or the military judge, as appropriate, for good cause shown.Discussion _See also_ R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3).

 The convening authority who receives an objection may direct that the preliminary hearing be reopened or take other action, as appropriate.Pretrial adviceIn general.Before any charge may be referred for trial by a general court-martial,it shall be referred to the staff judge advocate of the convening authorityfor consideration and advice.DiscussionA pretrial advice need not be prepared in cases referred to specialor summary courts-martial. A convening authority may, however, seek the adviceof a lawyer before referring charges to such a court-martial. When chargeshave been withdrawn from a general court-martial (_see_ R.C.M.604) or when a mistrial has been declared in a general court-martial (_see_ R.C.M. 915), supplementary advice is necessary before the chargesmay be referred to another general court-martial. 

 The staffjudge advocate may make changes in the charges and specifications in accordance with R.C.M. 603.Contents.The advice of the staff judge advocate shall include a written andsigned statement which sets forth that person's: Conclusion with respect to whether each specification alleges an offense under the code; Conclusion with respect to whether the allegation of each offenseis warranted by the evidence indicated in the report of preliminary hearing (ifthere is such a report); Conclusion with respect to whether a court-martial would have jurisdictionover the accused and the offense; and Recommendation of the action to be taken by the convening authority.DiscussionThe staff judge advocate is personally responsible for the pretrialadvice and must make an independent and informed appraisal of the chargesand evidence in order to render the advice. Another person may prepare theadvice, but the staff judge advocate is, unless disqualified, responsiblefor it and must sign it personally. Grounds for disqualification in a caseinclude previous action in that case as preliminary hearing officer, military judge,trial counsel, defense counsel, or member.

 The advice need not set forth the underlying analysis or rationale for its conclusions. Ordinarily, the charge sheet, forwarding letter, endorsements, and report of investigationare forwarded with the pretrial advice. In addition, the pretrial adviceshould include when appropriate: a brief summary of the evidence; discussionof significant aggravating, extenuating, or mitigating factors; any recommendationsfor disposition of the case by commanders or others who have forwarded thecharges; and the recommendation of the Article 32 preliminary hearing officer.However, there is no legal requirement to include such information, and failureto do so is not error. 

 Whatever matters are included inthe advice, whether or not they are required, should be accurate. Informationwhich is incorrect or so incomplete as to be misleading may result in a determinationthat the advice is defective, necessitating appropriate relief. _See_ R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3).

 The standard of proof to be applied in R.C.M. 406(b)(2) is probable cause. _See_ R.C.M. 601(d)(1). Defects in the pretrial advice are not jurisdictional and are raisedby pretrial motion. _See_ R.C.M.905(b)(1) and its Discussion.Distribution.A copy of the advice of the staff judge advocate shall be providedto the defense if charges are referred to trial by general court-martial.Action by commander exercising general court-martial jurisdictionDisposition.When in receipt of charges, a commander exercising general court-martialjurisdiction may: Dismiss any charges;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1) concerning dismissal of chargesand the effect of dismissing charges.Forward charges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to asubordinate commander for disposition; Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 401(c)(2)(B) concerning forwarding chargesto a subordinate.

If an investigation of the subject matter alreadyhas been conducted. _See_ R.C.M. 405(b).Subject to R.C.M. 601(d), refer charges to a general court-martial.Discussion_See_ Article 22 and R.C.M. 504(b)(1) concerning whomay exercise general court-martial jurisdiction. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 601 concerning referral of charges. _See_ R.C.M.306 and 401 concerning other dispositions.National security matters.When in receipt of charges the trial of which the commander exercisinggeneral court-martial jurisdiction finds would probably be inimical to theprosecution of a war or harmful to national security, that commander, unlessotherwise prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned, shall determinewhether trial is warranted and, if so, whether the security considerationsinvolved are paramount to trial. As the commander finds appropriate, thecommander may dismiss the charges, authorize trial of them, or forward themto a superior authority.DiscussionIn time of war, charges may be forwarded to the Secretary concerned for disposition under Article 43(e).

Members alsomay be excused as provided in subsections (c)(1)(B)(ii) and (c)(2)(A) ofthis rule.DiscussionChanges of the members of the court-martial should be kept to aminimum. If extensive changes are necessary and no session of the court-martialhas begun, it may be appropriate to withdraw the charges from one court-martialand refer them to another. _See_ R.C.M. 604.Procedure.When new persons are added as members or counsel or when substitutionsare made as to any members or counsel or the military judge, such personsshall be detailed in accordance with R.C.M. 503. An order changing the membersof the court-martial, except one which excuses members without replacement,shall be reduced to writing before authentication of the record of trial.DiscussionWhen members or counsel have been excused and the excusal is notreduced to writing, the excusal should be announced on the record. A memberwho has been temporarily excused need not be formally reappointed to thecourt-martial.Changes of members.Before assembly.By convening authority.Before the court-martial is assembled, the convening authority maychange the members of the court-martial without showing cause.

Change of military judge.Before assembly.Before the court-martial is assembled, the military judge may bechanged by an authority competent to detail the military judge, without causeshown on the record. After assembly.After the court-martial is assembled, the military judge may bechanged by an authority competent to detail the military judge only when,as a result of disqualification under R.C.M. 902 or for good cause shown,the previously detailed military judge is unable to proceed. Good cause.For purposes of this rule, "good cause" includes physicaldisability, military exigency, and other extraordinary circumstances whichrender the member, counsel, or military judge unable to proceed with thecourt-martial within a reasonable time. "Good cause" does notinclude temporary inconveniences which are incident to normal conditionsof military life. Accused's rights to counselIn general.The accused has the right to be represented before a general orspecial court-martial by civilian counsel if provided at no expense to theGovernment, and either by the military counsel detailed under Article 27or military counsel of the accused's own selection, if reasonably available.The accused is not entitled to be represented by more than one military counsel.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 502(d)(3) as to qualifications of civiliancounsel or individual military counsel.Individual military counsel.Reasonably available.Subject to this subsection, the Secretary concerned shall define"reasonably available." While so assigned, the following personsare not reasonably available to serve as individual military counsel becauseof the nature of their duties or positions: A general or flag officer; A trial or appellate military judge; A trial counsel; An appellate defense or government counsel; A principal legal advisor to a command, organization, or agencyand, when such command, organization, or agency has general court-martialjurisdiction, the principal assistant of such an advisor; An instructor or student at a service school or academy: A student at a college or university; A member of the staff of the Judge Advocate General of the Army,Navy, or Air Force, the Chief Counsel of the Coast Guard, or the Director,Judge Advocate Division, Headquarters, Marine Corps. 

 The Secretaryconcerned may determine other persons to be not reasonably available becauseof the nature or responsibilities of their assignments, geographic considerations,exigent circumstances, or military necessity. A person who is a member ofan armed force different from that of which the accused is a member shallbe reasonably available to serve as individual military counsel for such accusedto the same extent as that person is available to serve as individual militarycounsel for an accused in the same armed force as the person requested. TheSecretary concerned may prescribe circumstances under which exceptions may be made to the prohibitions in this subsection when merited by the existenceof an attorney-client relationship regarding matters relating to a chargein question. However, if the attorney-client relationship arose solely becausethe counsel represented the accused on review under Article 70, this exceptionshall not apply. Procedure.Subject to this subsection, the Secretary concerned shall prescribeprocedures for determining whether a requested person is "reasonablyavailable" to act as individual military counsel. Requests for an individualmilitary counsel shall be made by the accused or the detailed defense counselthrough the trial counsel to the convening authority. If the requested personis among those not reasonably available under subsection (b)(1) of this ruleor under regulations of the Secretary concerned, the convening authority shalldeny the request and notify the accused, unless the accused asserts thatthere is an existing attorney-client relationship regarding a charge in questionor that the person requested will not, at the time of the trial or investigationfor which requested, be among those so listed as not reasonably available.If the accused's request makes such a claim, or if the person is not amongthose so listed as not reasonably available, the convening authority shallforward the request to the commander or head of the organization, activity,or agency to which the requested person is assigned. That authority shallmake an administrative determination whether the requested person is reasonablyavailable in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Secretary concerned.This determination is a matter within the sole discretion of that authority.An adverse determination may be reviewed upon request of the accused throughthat authority to the next higher commander or level of supervision, butno administrative review may be made which requires action at the departmentalor higher level. Excusal of detailed counsel.If the accused is represented by individual military counsel, detaileddefense counsel shall normally be excused. The authority who detailed thedefense counsel, as a matter of discretion, may approve a request from theaccused that detailed defense counsel shall act as associate counsel. Theaction of the authority who detailed the counsel is subject to review onlyfor abuse of discretion.DiscussionA request under subsection (b)(3) should be considered in lightof the general statutory policy that the accused is not entitled to be representedby more than one military counsel. Among the factors that may be considered in the exercise of discretion are the seriousness of the case, retentionof civilian defense counsel, complexity of legal or factual issues, and thedetail of additional trial counsel. 

 _See_ R.C.M.905(b)(6) and 906(b)(2) as to motions concerning denial of a request forindividual military counsel or retention of detailed counsel as associatecounsel.Excusal or withdrawal.Except as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 505(d)(2) and subsection(b)(3) of this rule, defense counsel may be excused only with the expressconsent of the accused, or by the military judge upon application for withdrawal by the defense counsel for good cause shown. Waiver.The accused may expressly waive the right to be represented by counseland may thereafter conduct the defense personally. Such waiver shall be acceptedby the military judge only if the military judge finds that the accused iscompetent to understand the disadvantages of self-representation and thatthe waiver is voluntary and understanding. The military judge may requirethat a defense counsel remain present even if the accused waives counseland conducts the defense personally. The right of the accused to conduct thedefense personally may be revoked if the accused is disruptive or fails tofollow basic rules of decorum and procedure. Nonlawyer present.Subject to the discretion of the military judge, the accused mayhave present and seated at the counsel table for purpose of consultationpersons not qualified to serve as counsel under R.C.M. 502.Discussion_See_ also Mil. R. Evid. 615 if the person is a potentialwitness in the case.REFERRAL, SERVICE, AMENDMENT, AND WITHDRAWAL OF CHARGESReferralIn general.Referral is the order of a convening authority that charges againstan accused will be tried by a specified court-martial.DiscussionReferral of charges requires three elements: a convening authoritywho is authorized to convene the court-martial and is not disqualified(_see_ R.C.M. 601(b) and (c)); preferred charges which have been receivedby the convening authority for disposition (_see_ R.C.M. 307as to preferral of charges and Chapter IV as to disposition); and a court-martialconvened by that convening authority or a predecessor (_see_ R.C.M.504). 

 If trial would be warranted but would be detrimentalto the prosecution of a war or inimical to national security, _see_ R.C.M. 401(d) and 407(b).Who may refer.Any convening authority may refer charges to a court-martial convenedby that convening authority or a predecessor, unless the power to do so hasbeen withheld by superior competent authority.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 306(a), 403, 404, 407, and 504. 

 Theconvening authority may be of any command, including a command different fromthat of the accused, but as a practical matter the accused must be subjectto the orders of the convening authority or otherwise under the conveningauthority's control to assure the appearance of the accused at trial. The convening authority's power over the accused may be based upon agreementsbetween the commanders concerned.Disqualification.An accuser may not refer charges to a general or special court-martial.DiscussionConvening authorities are not disqualified from referring chargesby prior participation in the same case except when they have acted as accuser.For a definition of "accuser," _see_ Article 1(9). A convening authority who is disqualified may forward the charges and alliedpapers for disposition by competent authority superior in rank or command. _See_ R.C.M. 401(c) concerning actions which the superior may take. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 1302 for rules relating to convening summary courts-martial.When charges may be referred.Basis for referral.If the convening authority finds or is advised by a judge advocate that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offense triable by acourt-martial has been committed and that the accused committed it, and thatthe specification alleges an offense, the convening authority may refer it.The finding may be based on hearsay in whole or in part. The convening authorityor judge advocate may consider information from any source and shall notbe limited to the information reviewed by any previous authority, but a casemay not be referred to a general court-martial except in compliance withsubsection (d)(2) of this rule. The convening authority or judge advocateshall not be required before charges are referred to resolve legal issues,including objections to evidence, which may arise at trial.DiscussionFor a discussion of selection among alternative dispositions, _see_ R.C.M. 306. The convening authority is not obliged to refer all charges which the evidence might support. The convening authority shouldconsider the options and considerations under R.C.M. 306 in exercising thediscretion to refer.General courts-martial.The convening authority may not refer a specification under a charge to a general court-martial unless- There has been substantial compliance with the pretrial investigationrequirements of R.C.M. 405; and The convening authority has received the advice of the staff judgeadvocate required under R.C.M. 406. These requirements may be waived by theaccused.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(C) concerning limitationson referral of capital offenses to special courts-martial. _See_ R.C.M.103(3) for the definition of a capital offense. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 1301(c) concerning limitations on the referral of certaincases to summary courts-martial.How charges shall be referred.Order, instructions.Referral shall be by the personal order of the convening authority.The convening authority may include proper instructions in the order.DiscussionReferral is ordinarily evidenced by an indorsement on the chargesheet. Although the indorsement should be completed on all copies of thecharge sheet, only the original must be signed. The signature may be thatof a person acting by the order or direction of the convening authority. Insuch a case the signature element must reflect the signer's authority. 

 If,for any reason, charges are referred to a court-martial different from thatto which they were originally referred, the new referral is ordinarily madeby a new indorsement attached to the original charge sheet. The previousindorsement should be lined out and initialed by the person signing the newreferral. The original indorsement should not be obliterated. _Seealso_ R.C.M. 604. 

 If the only officer present ina command refers the charges to a summary court-martial and serves as thesummary court-martial under R.C.M. 1302, the indorsement should be completedwith the additional comments, "only officer present in the command." 

 Theconvening authority may instruct that the charges against the accused be triedwith certain other charges against the accused. _See_ subsection(2) below. 

 The convening authority may instruct that chargesagainst one accused be referred for joint or common trial with another accused. _See_ subsection (3) below.

 The convening authority shall indicate that the case is to be tried as a capital case by including a special instruction in the referral block of the charge sheet. Failure to include this special instruction at the time of the referral shall not bar the convening authority from later adding the required special instruction, provided that the convening authority has otherwise complied with the applicable notice requirements. If the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure to include the special instruction, a continuance or a recess is an adequate remedy.

 The convening authority should acknowledgeby an instruction that a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more thansix months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudgedwhen the prerequisites under Article 19 will not be met. _See_ R.C.M.201(f)(2)(B)(ii). For example, this instruction may be given when a courtreporter is not detailed. 

 Any special instructions mustbe stated in the referral indorsement. 

 When the chargeshave been referred to a court-martial, the indorsed charge sheet and allied papers should be promptly transmitted to the trial counsel.Joinder of offenses.In the discretion of the convening authority, two or more offensescharged against an accused may be referred to the same court-martial fortrial, whether serious or minor offenses or both, regardless whether related.Additional charges may be joined with other charges for a single trial atany time before arraignment if all necessary procedural requirements concerningthe additional charges have been complied with. After arraignment of theaccused upon charges, no additional charges may be referred to the same trialwithout consent of the accused.DiscussionOrdinarily all known charges should be referred to a single court-martial.Joinder of accused.Allegations against two or more accused may be referred for jointtrial if the accused are alleged to have participated in the same act ortransaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting anoffense or offenses. Such accused may be charged in one or more specificationstogether or separately, and every accused need not be charged in each specification.Related allegations against two or more accused which may be proved by substantiallythe same evidence may be referred to a common trial.DiscussionA joint offense is one committed by two or more persons acting togetherwith a common intent. Joint offenses may be referred for joint trial, alongwith all related offenses against each of the accused. A common trial maybe used when the evidence of several offenses committed by several accusedseparately is essentially the same, even though the offenses were not jointlycommitted. _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5) Discussion. Convening authoritiesshould consider that joint and common trials may be complicated by proceduraland evidentiary rules.Superior convening authorities.Except as otherwise provided in these rules, a superior competentauthority may cause charges, whether or not referred, to be transmitted tothe authority for further consideration, including, if appropriate, referral.Parallel convening authorities.If it is impracticable for the original convening authority to continue exercising authority over the charges, the convening authority may cause the charges, even if referred, to be transmitted to a parallel convening authority. This transmittal must be in writing and in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe. Subsequent actions taken by the parallel convening authority are within the sole discretion of that convening authority.Discussion Parallel convening authorities are those convening authorities that possess the same court-martial jurisdiction authority. Examples of permissible transmittal of charges under this rule include the transmittal from a general court-martial convening authority to another general court-martial convening authority, or from one special court-martial convening authority to another special court-martial convening authority. It would be impracticable for an original convening authority to continue exercising authority over the charges, for example, when a command is being decommissioned or inactivated, or when deploying or redeploying and the accused is remaining behind. If charges have been referred, there is no requirement that the charges be withdrawn or dismissed prior to transfer. _See_ R.C.M. 604. In the event that the case has been referred, the receiving convening authority may adopt the original court-martial convening order, including the court-martial panel selected to hear the case as indicated in that convening order. When charges are transmitted under this rule, no recommendation as to disposition may be made.Service of chargesThe trial counsel detailed to the court-martial to which chargeshave been referred for trial shall cause to be served upon each accused acopy of the charge sheet. In time of peace, no person may, over objection,be brought to trial-including an Article 39(a) session-beforea general court-martial within a period of five days after service of charges,or before a special court-martial within a period of three days after serviceof charges. In computing these periods, the date of service of charges andthe date of trial are excluded; holidays and Sundays are included.DiscussionTrial counsel should comply with this rule immediately upon receiptof the charges. Whenever after service the charges are amended or changedthe trial counsel must give notice of the changes to the defense counsel.Whenever such amendments or changes add a new party, a new offense, or substantiallynew allegations, the charge sheet so amended or changed must be served anew. _See also_ R.C.M. 603. 

 Service may be made only uponthe accused; substitute service upon defense counsel is insufficient. Thetrial counsel should promptly inform the defense counsel when charges havebeen served. 

 If the accused has questions when served withcharges, the accused should be told to discuss the matter with defense counsel.Changes to charges and specificationsMinor changes defined.Minor changes in charges and specifications are any except thosewhich add a party, offenses, or substantial matter not fairly included inthose previously preferred, or which are likely to mislead the accused asto the offenses charged.DiscussionMinor changes include those necessary to correct inartfully draftedor redundant specifications; to correct a misnaming of the accused; to allegethe proper article; or to correct other slight errors. Minor charges alsoinclude those which reduce the seriousness of an offense, as when the valueof an allegedly stolen item in a larceny specification is reduced, or whena desertion specification is amended to allege only unauthorized absence.Minor changes before arraignment.Any person forwarding, acting upon, or prosecuting charges on behalfof the United States except a preliminary hearing officer appointed under R.C.M.405 may make minor changes to charges or specifications before arraignment.DiscussionCharges forwarded or referred for trial should be free from defectsof form and substance. Minor errors may be corrected and the charge may beredrafted without being sworn anew by the accuser. Other changes should besigned and sworn to by an accuser. All changes in the charges should be initialedby the person who makes them. A trial counsel acting under this provisionordinarily should consult with the convening authority before making any changes which, even though minor, change the nature or seriousness of the offense.Minor changes after arraignment.After arraignment the military judge may, upon motion, permit minorchanges in the charges and specifications at any time before findings areannounced if no substantial right of the accused is prejudiced. Major changes.Changes or amendments to charges or specifications other than minorchanges may not be made over the objection of the accused unless the chargeor specification affected is preferred anew.DiscussionIf there has been a major change or amendment over the accused'sobjection to a charge already referred, a new referral is necessary. Similarly,in the case of a general court-martial, a new investigation under R.C.M.405 will be necessary if the charge as amended or changed was not coveredin the prior investigation. If the substance of the charge or specificationas amended or changed has not been referred or, in the case of a generalcourt-martial, investigated, a new referral and, if appropriate, investigationare necessary. When charges are re-referred, they must be served anew underR.C.M. 602.Withdrawal of chargesWithdrawal.The convening authority or a superior competent authority may forany reason cause any charges or specifications to be withdrawn from a court-martialat any time before findings are announced.DiscussionCharges which are withdrawn from a court-martial should be dismissed(_see_ R.C.M. 401(c)(1)) unless it is intended to refer themanew promptly or to forward them to another authority for disposition. 

 Chargesshould not be withdrawn from a court-martial arbitrarily or unfairly to anaccused. _See also_ subsection (b) of this rule. 

 Someor all charges and specifications may be withdrawn. In a joint or common trialthe withdrawal may be limited to charges against one or some of the accused. 

 Chargeswhich have been properly referred to a court-martial may be withdrawn onlyby the direction of the convening authority or a superior competent authorityin the exercise of that officer's independent judgment. When directed todo so by the convening authority or a superior competent authority, trialcounsel may withdraw charges or specifications by lining out the affectedcharges or specifications, renumbering remaining charges or specificationsas necessary, and initialing the changes. Charges and specifications withdrawnbefore commencement of trial will not be brought to the attention of themembers. When charges or specifications are withdrawn after they have cometo the attention of the members, the military judge must instruct them thatthe withdrawn charges or specifications may not be considered for any reason.Referral of withdrawn charges.Charges which have been withdrawn from a court-martial may be referredto another court-martial unless the withdrawal was for an improper reason.Charges withdrawn after the introduction of evidence on the general issue of guilt may be referred to another court-martial only if the withdrawalwas necessitated by urgent and unforeseen military necessity.Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 915 (Mistrial). 

 Whencharges which have been withdrawn from a court-martial are referred to anothercourt-martial, the reasons for the withdrawal and later referral should beincluded in the record of the later court-martial, if the later referralis more onerous to the accused. Therefore, if further prosecution is contemplatedat the time of the withdrawal, the reasons for the withdrawal should be includedin or attached to the record of the earlier proceeding. 

 Improperreasons for withdrawal include an intent to interfere with the free exerciseby the accused of constitutional rights or rights provided under the code, or with the impartialityof a court-martial. A withdrawal is improper if it was not directed personallyand independently by the convening authority or by a superior competent authority. 

 Whetherthe reason for a withdrawal is proper, for purposes of the propriety of alater referral, depends in part on the stage in the proceedings at whichthe withdrawal takes place. Before arraignment, there are many reasons fora withdrawal which will not preclude another referral. These include receipt of additional charges, absence of the accused, reconsideration by the conveningauthority or by a superior competent authority of the seriousness of theoffenses, questions concerning the mental capacity of the accused, and routineduty rotation of the personnel constituting the court-martial. Charges withdrawnafter arraignment may be referred to another court-martial under some circumstances.For example, it is permissible to refer charges which were withdrawn pursuantto a pretrial agreement if the accused fails to fulfill the terms of theagreement. _See_ R.C.M. 705. Charges withdrawn after some evidenceon the general issue of guilty is introduced may be re-referred only underthe narrow circumstances described in the rule.PRETRIAL MATTERSDiscoveryDisclosure by the trial counsel.Except as otherwise provided in subsections (f) and (g)(2) of thisrule, the trial counsel shall provide the following information or mattersto the defense- Papers accompanying charges; convening orders; statements.As soon as practicable after service of charges under R.C.M. 602,the trial counsel shall provide the defense with copies of, or, if extraordinarycircumstances make it impracticable to provide copies, permit the defenseto inspect: Any paper which accompanied the charges when they were referredto the court-martial, including papers sent with charges upon a rehearingor new trial; The convening order and any amending orders; and Any sworn or signed statement relating to an offense charged inthe case which is in the possession of the trial counsel.

 Article 46(b), enacted by section 1704 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, P.L. 113-66, 26 December 2013, as amended by section 531(b) of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, P.L. 113-291, 19 December 2014, is implemented by this rule.

 Counsel must remain cognizant of professional responsibility rules regarding communicating with represented persons.Information not subject to disclosure.Nothing in this rule shall be construed to require the disclosureof information protected from disclosure by the Military Rules of Evidence.Nothing in this rule shall require the disclosure or production of notes,memoranda, or similar working papers prepared by counsel and counsel's assistantsand representatives. Regulation of discovery.Time, place, and manner.The military judge may, consistent with this rule, specify the time,place, and manner of making discovery and may prescribe such terms and conditionsas are just. Protective and modifying orders.Upon a sufficient showing the military judge may at any time orderthat the discovery or inspection be denied, restricted, or deferred, or makesuch other order as is appropriate. Upon motion by a party, the militaryjudge may permit the party to make such showing, in whole or in part, in writingto be inspected only by the military judge. If the military judge grantsrelief after such an ex parte showing, the entire text of the party's statementshall be sealed and attached to the record of trial as an appellate exhibit.Such material may be examined by reviewing authorities in closed proceedingsfor the purpose of reviewing the determination of the military judge. Failure to comply.If at any time during the court-martial it is brought to the attentionof the military judge that a party has failed to comply with this rule, themilitary judge may take one or more of the following actions: Order the party to permit discovery; Grant a continuance; Prohibit the party from introducing evidence, calling a witness,or raising a defense not disclosed; and Enter such other order as is just under the circumstances. Thisrule shall not limit the right of the accused to testify in the accused'sbehalf.DiscussionFactors to be considered in determining whether to grant an exceptionto exclusion under subsection (3)(C) include: the extent of disadvantagethat resulted from a failure to disclose; the reason for the failure to disclose;the extent to which later events mitigated the disadvantage caused by thefailure to disclose; and any other relevant factors. 

 Thesanction of excluding the testimony of a defense witness should be used onlyupon finding that the defense counsel's failure to comply with this rulewas willful and motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage or toconceal a plan to present fabricated testimony. Moreover, the sanction ofexcluding the testimony of a defense witness should only be used if alternativesanctions could not have minimized the prejudice to the Government. Beforeimposing this sanction, the military judge must weigh the defendant's right to compulsory process against the countervailing public interests, including(1) the integrity of the adversary process; (2) the interest in the fairand efficient administration of military justice; and (3) the potential prejudiceto the truth-determining function of the trial process.

Procedures governing refusal to disclose an informant'sidentity are in Mil. R. Evid. 507.Inspect.As used in this rule "inspect" includes the right tophotograph and copy. DepositionsIn general.A deposition may be ordered whenever, after preferral of charges, due to exceptional circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness be taken and preserved for use at a preliminary hearing under Article 32 or a court-martial. A victim's declination to testify at a preliminary hearing or a victim's declination to submit to pretrial interviews shall not, by themselves, be considered exceptional circumstances. In accordance with subsection (b) of this rule below, the convening authority or military judge may order a deposition of a victim only if it is determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the victim will not be available to testify at court-martial.DiscussionA deposition is the out-of-court testimony of a witness under oathin response to questions by the parties, which is reduced to writing or recordedon videotape or audiotape or similar material. A deposition taken on oralexamination is an oral deposition, and a deposition taken on written interrogatoriesis a written deposition. Written interrogatories are questions, preparedby the prosecution, defense, or both, which are reduced to writing beforesubmission to a witness whose testimony is to be taken by deposition. Theanswers, reduced to writing and properly sworn to, constitute the depositiontestimony of the witness. 

 Note that under subsection (i)of this rule a deposition may be taken by agreement of the parties withoutnecessity of an order. 

 A deposition may be taken to preservethe testimony of a witness who is likely to be unavailable at the investigationunder Article 32 (_see_ R.C.M. 405(g)) or at the time of trial(_see_ R.C.M. 703(b)). Part of all or a deposition, so faras otherwise admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence, may be usedon the merits or on an interlocutory question as substantive evidence if thewitness is unavailable under Mil. R. Evid. 804(a) except that a depositionmay be admitted in a capital case only upon offer by the defense. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 804(b)(1). In any case, a deposition may be usedby any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimonyof the deponent as a witness. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 613. Ifonly a part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverseparty may require the proponent to offer all which is relevant to the partoffered, and any party may offer other parts. _See_ Mil. R.Evid. 106. 

 A deposition which is transcribed is ordinarilyread to the court-martial by the party offering it. _See also_ subsection(g)(3) of this rule. The transcript of a deposition may not be inspected bythe members. Objections may be made to testimony in a written depositionin the same way that they would be if the testimony were offered throughthe personal appearance of a witness. 

 Part or all of a depositionso far as otherwise admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence may beused in presentencing proceedings as substantive evidence as provided in R.C.M.1001.

Waiver.Failure to review before the military judge a request for a depositiondenied by a convening authority waives further consideration of the request.Action when request is approved.Detail of deposition officer.When a request for a deposition is approved, the convening authority shall detail a judge advocate certified under Art. 27(b) to serve as deposition officer. When the appointment of a judge advocate as deposition officer is not practicable, the convening authority may detail an impartial commissioned officer or appropriate civil officer authorized to administer oaths, not the accuser, to serve as deposition officer. If the deposition officer is not a judge advocate, an impartial judge advocate certified under Art. 27(b) shall be made available to provide legal advice to the deposition officer.Discussion_See_ Article 49(c). 

 When a depositionwill be at a point distant from the command, an appropriate authority maybe requested to make available an officer to serve as deposition officer.Assignment of counsel.If charges have not yet been referred to a court-martial when arequest to take a deposition is approved, the convening authority who directedthe taking of the deposition shall ensure that counsel qualified as requiredunder R.C.M. 502(d) are assigned to represent each party.DiscussionThe counsel who represents the accused at a deposition ordinarilywill form an attorney-client relationship with the accused which will continuethrough a later court-martial. _ See_ R.C.M. 506.

When the testimony is transcribed, the depositionshall, except when impracticable, be submitted to the witness for examination.The deposition officer may enter additional matters then stated by the witnessunder oath. The deposition shall be signed by the witness if the witnessis available. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the depositionofficer shall record the reason. The certificate of authentication shallthen be executed.

The deposition need not be included in the record of trial.Objections.In general.A failure to object prior to the deposition to the taking of thedeposition on grounds which may be corrected if the objection is made priorto the deposition waives such objection. Oral depositions.Objections to questions, testimony, or evidence at an oral depositionand the grounds for such objection shall be stated at the time of takingsuch deposition. If an objection relates to a matter which could have been corrected if the objection had been made during the deposition, the objectionis waived if not made at the deposition.DiscussionA party may show that an objection was made during the depositionbut not recorded, but, in the absence of such evidence, the transcript ofthe deposition governs.Written depositions.Objections to any question in written interrogatories shall be servedon the party who proposed the question before the interrogatories are sentto the deposition officer or the objection is waived.

With the consent of both the accused and Government, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify via remote means. Over a party's objection, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify on interlocutory questions via remote means or similar technology if the practical difficulties of producing the witness outweigh the significance of the witness' personal appearance (although such testimony will not be admissible over the accused's objection as evidence on the ultimate issue of guilt). Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to: the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the interlocutory proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; the likelihood of significant interference with military operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-court testimony.Discussion_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 401 concerning relevance.

 Relevant testimony is necessary when it is not cumulative and when it would contributeto a party's presentation of the case in some positive way on a matter inissue. A matter is not in issue when it is stipulated as a fact.

 The procedures for receiving testimony via remote means and the definition thereof are contained in R.C.M. 914B. An issue may arise as both an interlocutory question and a question that bears on the ultimate issue of guilt. See R.C.M. 801(e)(5). In such circumstances, this rule authorizes the admission of testimony by remote means or similar technology over the accused's objection only as evidence on the interlocutory question. In most instances, testimony taken over a party's objection will not be admissible as evidence on the question that bears on the ultimate issue of guilt; however, there may be certain limited circumstances where the testimony is admissible on the ultimate issue of guilt. Such determinations must be made based upon the relevant rules of evidence.On sentencing.Each party is entitled to the production of a witness whose testimonyon sentencing is required under R.C.M. 1001(e). Unavailable witness.Notwithstanding subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this rule, a partyis not entitled to the presence of a witness who is unavailable within themeaning of Mil. R. Evid. 804(a). However, if the testimony of a witness whois unavailable is of such central importance to an issue that it is essentialto a fair trial, and if there is no adequate substitute for such testimony,the military judge shall grant a continuance or other relief in order toattempt to secure the witness' presence or shall abate the proceedings, unlessthe unavailability of the witness is the fault of or could have been preventedby the requesting party. Determining which witness will be produced.Witnesses for the prosecution.The trial counsel shall obtain the presence of witnesses whose testimonythe trial counsel considers relevant and necessary for the prosecution.Witnesses for the defense.Request.The defense shall submit to the trial counsel a written list ofwitnesses whose production by the Government the defense requests. Contents of request.Witnesses on merits or interlocutory questions.A list of witnesses whose testimony the defense considers relevantand necessary on the merits or on an interlocutory question shall includethe name, telephone number, if known, and address or location of the witness such that the witness can be found upon the exercise of due diligence anda synopsis of the expected testimony sufficient to show its relevance andnecessity. Witnesses on sentencing.A list of witnesses wanted for presentencing proceedings shall includethe name, telephone number, if known, and address or location of the witnesssuch that the witness can be found upon the exercise of due diligence, asynopsis of the testimony that it is expected the witness will give, and thereasons why the witness' personal appearance will be necessary under thestandards set forth in R.C.M. 1001(e). Time of request.A list of witnesses under this subsection shall be submitted intime reasonably to allow production of each witness on the date when thewitness' presence will be necessary. The military judge may set a specificdate by which such lists must be submitted. Failure to submit the name ofa witness in a timely manner shall permit denial of a motion for productionof the witness, but relief from such denial may be granted for good causeshown. Determination.The trial counsel shall arrange for the presence of any witness listed by the defense unless the trial counsel contends that the witness' production is not required under this rule. If the trial counsel contendsthat the witness' production is not required by this rule, the matter maybe submitted to the military judge. If the military judge grants a motionfor a witness, the trial counsel shall produce the witness or the proceedingsshall be abated.DiscussionWhen significant or unusual costs would be involved in producing witnesses, the trial counsel should inform the convening authority, as the convening authority may elect to dispose of the matter by means other thana court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(7). _See also_ R.C.M. 905(j).Employment of expert witnesses.When the employment at Government expense of an expert is considered necessary by a party, the party shall, in advance of employment of the expert, and with notice to the opposing party, submit a request to the conveningauthority to authorize the employment and to fix the compensation for theexpert. The request shall include a complete statement of reasons why employmentof the expert is necessary and the estimated cost of employment. A requestdenied by the convening authority may be renewed before the military judgewho shall determine whether the testimony of the expert is relevant and necessary,and, if so, whether the Government has provided or will provide an adequate substitute. If the military judge grants a motion for employment of an expertor finds that the Government is required to provide a substitute, the proceedingsshall be abated if the Government fails to comply with the ruling. In theabsence of advance authorization, an expert witness may not be paid feesother than those to which entitled under subsection (e)(2)(D) of this rule.Discussion_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 702, 706.Procedures for production of witnesses.Military witnesses.The attendance of a military witness may be obtained by notifyingthe commander of the witness of the time, place, and date the witness' presenceis required and requesting the commander to issue any necessary orders tothe witness.DiscussionWhen military witnesses are located near the court-martial, their presence can usually be obtained through informal coordination with themand their commander. If the witness is not near the court-martial and attendancewould involve travel at government expense, or if informal coordinationis inadequate, the appropriate superior should be requested to issue thenecessary order. 

 If practicable, a request for the attendanceof a military witness should be made so that the witness will have at least48 hours notice before starting to travel to attend the court-martial. 

 Theattendance of persons not on active duty should be obtained in the mannerprescribed in subsection (e)(2) of this rule.Civilian witnesses-subpoena.In general.The presence of witnesses not on active duty may be obtained by subpoena.DiscussionA subpoena is not necessary if the witness appears voluntarily atno expense to the United States. 

 Civilian employees ofthe Department of Defense may be directed by appropriate authorities to appearas witnesses in courts-martial as an incident of their employment. Appropriatetravel orders may be issued for this purpose. 

 A subpoenamay not be used to compel a civilian to travel outside the United Statesand its territories. 

 A witness must be subject to UnitedStates jurisdiction to be subject to a subpoena. Foreign nationals in a foreigncountry are not subject to subpoena. Their presence may be obtained throughcooperation of the host nation.Contents. A subpoena shall state the command by which the proceeding is directed, and the title, if any, of the proceeding. A subpoena shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony at the time and place specified therein. A subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information designated therein at the proceeding or at an earlier time for inspection by the parties. A subpoena issued for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 shall not command any person to attend or give testimony at an Article 32 preliminary hearing.DiscussionA subpoena may not be used to compel a witness to appear at an examination or interview before trial, but a subpoena may be used to obtain witnesses for a deposition or a court of inquiry. In accordance with subsection (f)(4)(B) of this rule, a subpoena duces tecum to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information for pretrial investigation pursuant to Article 32 may be issued, following the convening authority's order directing such pretrial investigation, by either the investigating officer appointed under R.C.M. 405(d)(1) or the counsel representing the United States.

 A subpoena normally is prepared, signed, and issued in duplicate on the official forms. _See_ Appendix 7 for an example of a subpoena with certificate of service (DD Form 453) and a Travel Order (DD Form 453-1).Who may issue.A subpoena to secure evidence may be issued by:The summary court-martial;Detailed counsel for the government at an Article 32 preliminary hearing;After referral to a court-martial, detailed trial counsel;The president of a court of inquiry; orAn officer detailed to take a deposition.A subpoena to secure witnesses may be issued by:the summary court-martial;after referral to a court-martial, detailed trial counsel;the president of a court of inquiry; oran officer detailed to take a deposition.Service.A subpoena may be served by the person authorized by this rule to issue it, a United States Marshal, or any other person who is not less than 18 years of age. Service shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person named and by providing to the person named travel orders and a means for reimbursement for fees and mileage as may be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, or in the case of hardship resulting in the subpoenaed witness's inability to comply with the subpoena absent initial government payment, by providing to the person named travel orders, fees, and mileage sufficient to comply with the subpoena in rules prescribed by the Secretary concerned.DiscussionIf practicable, a subpoena should be issued in time to permit service at least 24 hours before the time the witness will have to travel to comply with the subpoena.

 _Informal service._ Unless formal service is advisable, the person who issued the subpoena may mail it to the witness in duplicate, enclosing a postage-paid envelope bearing a return address, with the request that the witness sign the acceptance of service on the copy and return it in the envelope provided. The return envelope should be addressed to the person who issued the subpoena. The person who issued the subpoena should include with it a statement to the effect that the rights of the witness to fees and mileage will not be impaired by voluntary compliance with the request and that a voucher for fees and mileage will be delivered to the witness promptly on being discharged from attendance.

 _Formal service._ Formal service is advisable whenever it is anticipated that the witness will not comply voluntarily with the subpoena. Appropriate fees and mileage must be paid or tendered. _See_ Article 47. If formal service is advisable, the person who issued the subpoena must assure timely and economical service. That person may do so by serving the subpoena personally when the witness is in the vicinity. When the witness is not in the vicinity, the subpoena may be sent in duplicate to the commander of a military installation near the witness. Such commanders should give prompt and effective assistance, issuing travel orders for their personnel to serve the subpoena when necessary.

 Service should ordinarily be made by a person subject to the code. The duplicate copy of the subpoena must have entered upon it proof of service as indicated on the form and must be promptly returned to the person who issued the subpoena. If service cannot be made, the person who issued the subpoena must be informed promptly. A stamped, addressed envelope should be provided for these purposes.

 For purposes of this Rule, _hardship_ is defined as any situation which would substantially preclude reasonable efforts to appear that could be solved by providing transportation or fees and mileage to which the witness is entitled for appearing at the hearing in question.Place of service.In general.A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition, court-martial, or court of inquiry may be served at any place within theUnited States, it Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions. Foreign territory.In foreign territory, the attendance of civilian witnesses may be obtained in accordance with existing agreements or, in the absence of agreements,with principles of international law. Occupied territory.In occupied enemy territory, the appropriate commander may compelthe attendance of civilian witnesses located within the occupied territory.Relief.If a person subpoenaed requests relief on grounds that complianceis unreasonable or oppressive, the convening authority or, after referral,the military judge may direct that the subpoena be modified or withdrawnif appropriate. Neglect or refusal to appear.Issuance of warrant of attachment.The military judge or, if there is no military judge, the conveningauthority may, in accordance with this rule, issue a warrant of attachmentto compel the attendance of a witness or production of documents.DiscussionA warrant of attachment (DD Form 454) may be used when necessary to compel a witness to appear or produce evidence under this rule. A warrant of attachment is a legal order addressed to an official directing that official to have the person named in the order brought before a court.

 Subpoenas issued under R.C.M. 703 are Federal process and a person not subject to the code may be prosecuted in a Federal civilian court under Article 47 for failure to comply with a subpoena issued in compliance with this rule and formally served.

 Failing to comply with such a subpoena is a felony offense, and may result in a fine or imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of the district court. The different purposes of the warrant of attachment and criminal complaint under Article 47 should be borne in mind. The warrant of attachment, available without the intervention of civilian judicial proceedings, has as its purpose the obtaining of the witness's presence, testimony, or documents. The criminal complaint, prosecuted through the civilian Federal courts, has as its purpose punishment for failing to comply with process issued by military authority. It serves to vindicate the military interest in obtaining compliance with its lawful process.

 For subpoenas issued for a pretrial investigation pursuant to Article 32 under subsection (f)(4)(B), the general court-martial convening authority with jurisdiction over the case may issue a warrant of attachment to compel production of documents.Requirements.A warrant of attachment may be issued only upon probable cause to believe that the witness was duly served with a subpoena, that the subpoena was issued in accordance with these rules, that a means of reimbursement of fees and mileage was provided to the witness or advanced to the witness in cases of hardship, that the witness is material, that the witness refused or willfully neglected to appear at the time and place specified on the subpoena, and that no valid excuse is reasonably apparent for the witness's failure to appear.Form.A warrant of attachment shall be written. All documents in supportof the warrant of attachment shall be attached to the warrant, together withthe charge sheet and convening orders. Execution.A warrant of attachment may be executed by a United States marshalor such other person who is not less than 18 years of age as the authorityissuing the warrant may direct. Only such nondeadly force as may be necessaryto bring the witness before the court-martial or other proceeding may be usedto execute the warrant. A witness attached under this rule shall be broughtbefore the court-martial or proceeding without delay and shall testify assoon as practicable and be released.DiscussionIn executing a warrant of attachment, no more force than necessaryto bring the witness to the court-martial, deposition, or court of inquirymay be used.Definition.For purposes of subsection (e)(2)(G) of this rule "militaryjudge" does not include a summary court-martial or the president ofa special court-martial without a military judge. Right to evidence.In general.Each party is entitled to the production of evidence which is relevantand necessary.DiscussionRelevance is defined by Mil. R. Evid. 401. Relevant evidence is necessary when it is not cumulative and when it would contribute to a party's presentation of the case in some positive way on a matter in issue. A matter is not in issue when it is stipulated as a fact. The discovery and introduction of classified or other government information is controlled by Mil. R. Evid. 505 and 506.Unavailable evidence.Notwithstanding subsection (f)(1) of this rule, a party is not entitledto the production of evidence which is destroyed, lost, or otherwise notsubject to compulsory process. However, if such evidence is of such centralimportance to an issue that it is essential to a fair trial, and if thereis no adequate substitute for such evidence, the military judge shall granta continuance or other relief in order to attempt to produce the evidenceor shall abate the proceedings, unless the unavailability of the evidenceis the fault of or could have been prevented by the requesting party. Determining what evidence will be produced.The procedures in subsection (c) of this rule shall apply to a determinationof what evidence will be produced, except that any defense request for theproduction of evidence shall list the items of evidence to be produced andshall include a description of each item sufficient to show its relevanceand necessity, a statement where it can be obtained, and, if known, the name,address, and telephone number of the custodian of the evidence. Procedures for production of evidence.Evidence under the control of the Government.Evidence under the control of the Government may be obtained bynotifying the custodian of the evidence of the time, place, and date theevidence is required and requesting the custodian to send or deliver the evidence.Evidence not under the control of the government. Evidence not under the control of the government may be obtained by a subpoena issued in accordance with subsection (e)(2) of this rule. A _subpoena duces tecum_ to produce books, papers, documents, data, or other objects or electronically stored information for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Article 32 may be issued, following the convening authority's order directing such preliminary hearing, by counsel for the government. A person in receipt of a _subpoena duces tecum_ for an Article 32 hearing need not personally appear in order to comply with the subpoena.DiscussionThe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, P.L. 112-81, --SECT-- 542, amended Article 47 to allow the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum for Article 32 hearings. Although the amended language cites Article 32(b), this new subpoena power extends to documents subpoenaed by the investigating officer and counsel representing the United States, whether or not requested by the defense.Relief.If the person having custody of evidence requests relief on groundsthat compliance with the subpoena or order of production is unreasonableor oppressive, the convening authority or, after referral, the military judgemay direct that the subpoena or order of production be withdrawn or modified.Subject to Mil. R. Evid. 505 and 506, the military judge may direct thatthe evidence be submitted to the military judge for an in camera inspectionin order to determine whether such relief should be granted. ImmunityTypes of immunity.Two types of immunity may be granted under this rule. Transactional immunity.A person may be granted transactional immunity from trial by court-martialfor one or more offenses under the code. Testimonial immunity.A person may be granted immunity from the use of testimony, statements,and any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony orstatements by that person in a later court-martial.Discussion"Testimonial" immunity is also called "use"immunity. 

 Immunity ordinarily should be granted only whentestimony or other information from the person is necessary to the publicinterest, including the needs of good order and discipline, and when the person has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other informationon the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination. 

 Testimonialimmunity is preferred because it does not bar prosecution of the person for the offenses about which testimony or information is given under the grantof immunity. 

 In any trial of a person granted testimonialimmunity after the testimony or information is given, the Government mustmeet a heavy burden to show that it has not used in any way for the prosecutionof that person the person's statements, testimony, or information derivedfrom them. In many cases this burden makes difficult a later prosecutionof such a person for any offense that was the subject of that person's testimony or statements. Therefore, if it is intended to prosecute a person to whomtestimonial immunity has been or will be granted for offenses about whichthat person may testify or make statements, it may be necessary to try thatperson before the testimony or statements are given.Scope.Nothing in this rule bars: A later court-martial for perjury, false swearing, making a falseofficial statement, or failure to comply with an order to testify; or Use in a court-martial under subsection (b)(1) of this rule of testimonyor statements derived from such testimony or statements. Authority to grant immunity.Only a general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity,and may do so only in accordance with this rule.DiscussionOnly general court-martial convening authorities are authorizedto grant immunity. However, in some circumstances, when a person testifiesor makes statements pursuant to a promise of immunity, or a similar promise,by a person with apparent authority to make it, such testimony or statementsand evidence derived from them may be inadmissible in a later trial. Undersome circumstances a promise of immunity by someone other than a generalcourt-martial convening authority may bar prosecution altogether. Personsnot authorized to grant immunity should exercise care when dealing with accusedor suspects to avoid inadvertently causing statements to be inadmissibleor prosecution to be barred. 

 A convening authority who grantsimmunity to a prosecution witness in a court-martial may be disqualifiedfrom taking post-trial action in the case under some circumstances.Persons subject to the code.A general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity toany person subject to the code. However, a general court-martial conveningauthority may grant immunity to a person subject to the code extending toa prosecution in a United States District Court only when specifically authorizedto do so by the Attorney General of the United States or other authoritydesignated under 18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 6004.DiscussionWhen testimony or a statement for which a person subject to thecode may be granted immunity may relate to an offense for which that personcould be prosecuted in a United States District Court, immunity should notbe granted without prior coordination with the Department of Justice. Ordinarilycoordination with the local United States Attorney is appropriate. Unlessthe Department of Justice indicates it has no interest in the case, authorizationfor the grant of immunity should be sought from the Attorney General. A requestfor such authorization should be forwarded through the office of the JudgeAdvocate General concerned. Service regulations may provide additional guidance.Even if the Department of Justice expresses no interest in the case, authorizationby the Attorney General for the grant of immunity may be necessary to compel the person to testify or make a statement if such testimony or statementwould make the person liable for a Federal civilian offense.Persons not subject to the code.A general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity topersons not subject to the code only when specifically authorized to do soby the Attorney General of the United States or other authority designated under 18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 6004.Discussion_See_ the discussion under subsection (c)(1) of thisrule concerning forwarding a request for authorization to grant immunityto the Attorney General.Other limitations.The authority to grant immunity under this rule may not be delegated.The authority to grant immunity may be limited by superior authority.DiscussionDepartment of Defense Directive 1355.1 (21 July 1981) provides:"A proposed grant of immunity in a case involving espionage, subversion,aiding the enemy, sabotage, spying, or violation of rules or statutes concerning classified information or the foreign relations of the United States, shallbe forwarded to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense for thepurpose of consultation with the Department of Justice. The General Counselshall obtain the view of other appropriate elements of the Department ofdefense in furtherance of such consultation."Procedure.A grant of immunity shall be written and signed by the conveningauthority who issues it. The grant shall include a statement of the authorityunder which it is made and shall identify the matters to which it extends.DiscussionA person who has received a valid grant of immunity from a properauthority may be ordered to testify. In addition, a servicemember who hasreceived a valid grant of immunity may be ordered to answer questions byinvestigators or counsel pursuant to that grant. _See_ Mil.R. Evid. 301(c). A person who refuses to testify despite a valid grant ofimmunity may be prosecuted for such refusal. Persons subject to the codemay be charged under Article 134. _See_ paragraph 108, PartIV. A grant of immunity removes the right to refuse to testify or make astatement on self-incrimination grounds. It does not, however, remove other privileges against disclosure of information. _See_ Mil. R.Evid., Section V. 

 An immunity order or grant must not specifythe contents of the testimony it is expected the witness will give. 

 Whenimmunity is granted to a prosecution witness, the accused must be notifiedin accordance with Mil. R. Evid. 301(c)(2).Decision to grant immunity.Unless limited by superior competent authority, the decision togrant immunity is a matter within the sole discretion of the appropriategeneral court-martial convening authority. However, if a defense requestto immunize a witness has been denied, the military judge may, upon motionby the defense, grant appropriate relief directing that either an appropriateconvening authority grant testimonial immunity to a defense witness or, asto the affected charges and specifications, the proceedings against the accusedbe abated, upon findings that: The witness intends to invoke the right against self-incriminationto the extent permitted by law if called to testify; and The Government has engaged in discriminatory use of immunity toobtain a tactical advantage, or the Government, through its own overreaching,has forced the witness to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination;and The witness' testimony is material, clearly exculpatory, not cumulative,not obtainable from any other source and does more than merely affect thecredibility of other witnesses. Pretrial agreementsIn general.Subject to such limitations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, an accused and the convening authority may enter into a pretrial agreementin accordance with this rule.DiscussionThe authority of convening authorities to refer cases to trial and approve pretrial agreements extends only to trials by courts-martial. Toensure that such actions do not preclude appropriate action by Federal civilianauthorities in cases likely to be prosecuted in the United States DistrictCourts, convening authorities shall ensure that appropriate consultationunder the "Memorandum of Understanding Between the Departments ofJustice and Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of CrimesOver Which the Two Departments Have Concurrent Jurisdiction " has takenplace prior to trial by court-martial or approval of a pretrial agreementin cases where such consultation is required. _ See_ Appendix3.Nature of agreement.A pretrial agreement may include: A promise by the accused to plead guilty to, or to enter a confessionalstipulation as to one or more charges and specifications, and to fulfillsuch additional terms or conditions which may be included in the agreementand which are not prohibited under this rule; and A promise by the convening authority to do one or more of the following:Refer the charges to a certain type of court-martial; Refer a capital offense as noncapital; Withdraw one or more charges or specifications from the court-martial;DiscussionA convening authority may withdraw certain specifications and/or charges from a court-martial and dismiss them if the accused fulfills theaccused's promises in the agreement. Except when jeopardy has attached(_see_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C)), such withdrawal and dismissaldoes not bar later reinstitution of the charges by the same or a differentconvening authority. A judicial determination that the accused breachedthe pretrial agreement is not required prior to reinstitution of withdrawnor dismissed specifications and/or charges. If the defense moves to dismissthe reinstituted specifications and/or charges on the grounds that the government remains bound by the terms of the pretrial agreement, the government willbe required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the accusedhas breached the terms of the pretrial agreement. If the agreement is intended to grant immunity to an accused, _see_ R.C.M. 704.Have the trial counsel present no evidence as to one or more specificationsor portions thereof; and Take specified action on the sentence adjudged by the court-martial.DiscussionFor example, the convening authority may agree to approve no sentence in excess of a specified maximum, to suspend all or part of a sentence,to defer confinement, or to mitigate certain forms of punishment into lesssevere forms.Terms and conditions.Prohibited terms or conditions.Not voluntary.A term or condition in a pretrial agreement shall not be enforcedif the accused did not freely and voluntarily agree to it. Deprivation of certain rights.A term or condition in a pretrial agreement shall not be enforcedif it deprives the accused of: the right to counsel; the right to due process;the right to challenge the jurisdiction of the court-martial; the rightto a speedy trial; the right to complete sentencing proceedings; the completeand effective exercise of post-trial and appellate rights.DiscussionA pretrial agreement provision which prohibits the accused from making certain pretrial motions (_see_ R.C.M. 905-907)may be improper.Permissible terms or conditions.Subject to subsection (c)(1)(A) of this rule, subsection (c)(1)(B)of this rule does not prohibit either party from proposing the followingadditional conditions: A promise to enter into a stipulation of fact concerning offensesto which a plea of guilty or as to which a confessional stipulation willbe entered; A promise to testify as a witness in the trial of another person;Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 704(a)(2) concerning testimonial immunity.Only a general court-martial convening authority may grant immunity.A promise to provide restitution; A promise to conform the accused's conduct to certain conditionsof probation before action by the convening authority as well as duringany period of suspension of the sentence, provided that the requirements of R.C.M. 1109 must be complied with before an alleged violation of suchterms may relieve the convening authority of the obligation to fulfill theagreement; and A promise to waive procedural requirements such as the Article 32 preliminary hearing, the right to trial by court-martial composed of members orthe right to request trial by military judge alone, or the opportunity toobtain the personal appearance of witnesses at sentencing proceedings. Procedure.Negotiation.Pretrial agreement negotiations may be initiated by the accused, defense counsel, trial counsel, the staff judge advocate, convening authority,or their duly authorized representatives. Either the defense or the governmentmay propose any term or condition not prohibited by law or public policy.Government representatives shall negotiate with defense counsel unless theaccused has waived the right to counsel. Formal submission.After negotiation, if any, under subsection (d)(1) of this rule,if the accused elects to propose a pretrial agreement, the defense shallsubmit a written offer. All terms, conditions, and promises between theparties shall be written. The proposed agreement shall be signed by the accusedand defense counsel, if any. If the agreement contains any specified actionon the adjudged sentence, such action shall be set forth on a page separatefrom the other portions of the agreement.DiscussionThe first part of the agreement ordinarily contains an offer toplead guilty and a description of the offenses to which the offer extends.It must also contain a complete and accurate statement of any other agreedterms or conditions. For example, if the convening authority agrees to withdrawcertain specifications, or if the accused agrees to waive the right to anArticle 32 preliminary hearing, this should be stated. The written agreement shouldcontain a statement by the accused that the accused enters it freely andvoluntarily and may contain a statement that the accused has been advisedof certain rights in connection with the agreement.Acceptance.The convening authority may either accept or reject an offer ofthe accused to enter into a pretrial agreement or may propose by counterofferany terms or conditions not prohibited by law or public policy. The decisionwhether to accept or reject an offer is within the sole discretion of theconvening authority. When the convening authority has accepted a pretrialagreement, the agreement shall be signed by the convening authority or bya person, such as the staff judge advocate or trial counsel, who has beenauthorized by the convening authority to sign.DiscussionThe convening authority should consult with the staff judge advocate or trial counsel before acting on an offer to enter into a pretrial agreement.Withdrawal.By accused.The accused may withdraw from a pretrial agreement at any time; however, the accused may withdraw a plea of guilty or a confessional stipulationentered pursuant to a pretrial agreement only as provided in R.C.M. 910(h)or 811(d), respectively. By convening authority.The convening authority may withdraw from a pretrial agreement atany time before the accused begins performance of promises contained in theagreement, upon the failure by the accused to fulfill any material promiseor condition in the agreement, when inquiry by the military judge disclosesa disagreement as to a material term in the agreement, or if findings areset aside because a plea of guilty entered pursuant to the agreement is heldimprovident on appellate review. Nondisclosure of existence of agreement.Except in a special court-martial without a military judge, no memberof a court-martial shall be informed of the existence of a pretrial agreement.In addition, except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 410, the fact that an accusedoffered to enter into a pretrial agreement, and any statements made by anaccused in connection therewith, whether during negotiations or during aprovidence inquiry, shall not be otherwise disclosed to the members.Discussion _See also_ R.C.M. 910(f) (plea agreement inquiry).Inquiry into the mental capacity or mental responsibility of the accusedInitial action.If it appears to any commander who considers the disposition ofcharges, or to any preliminary hearing officer, trial counsel, defense counsel,military judge, or member that there is reason to believe that the accusedlacked mental responsibility for any offense charged or lacks capacity tostand trial, that fact and the basis of the belief or observation shall betransmitted through appropriate channels to the officer authorized to orderan inquiry into the mental condition of the accused. The submission may beaccompanied by an application for a mental examination under this rule.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 909 concerning the capacity of the accusedto stand trial and R.C.M. 916(k) concerning mental responsibility of theaccused.Ordering an inquiry.Before referral.Before referral of charges, an inquiry into the mental capacityor mental responsibility of the accused may be ordered by the convening authoritybefore whom the charges are pending for disposition. After referral.After referral of charges, an inquiry into the mental capacity ormental responsibility of the accused may be ordered by the military judge.The convening authority may order such an inquiry after referral of chargesbut before beginning of the first session of the court-martial (includingany Article 39(a) session) when the military judge is not reasonably available.The military judge may order a mental examination of the accused regardlessof any earlier determination by the convening authority. Inquiry.By whom conducted.When a mental examination is ordered under subsection (b) of thisrule, the matter shall be referred to a board consisting of one or more persons.Each member of the board shall be either a physician or a clinical psychologist.Normally, at least one member of the board shall be either a psychiatristor a clinical psychologist. The board shall report as to the mental capacityor mental responsibility or both of the accused. Matters in inquiry.When a mental examination is ordered under this rule, the ordershall contain the reasons for doubting the mental capacity or mental responsibility,or both, of the accused, or other reasons for requesting the examination.In addition to other requirements, the order shall require the board to makeseparate and distinct findings as to each of the following questions: At the time of the alleged criminal conduct, did the accused havea severe mental disease or defect? (The term "severe mental diseaseor defect" does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct, or minor disorders such as nonpsychoticbehavior disorders and personality defects.) What is the clinical psychiatric diagnosis? Was the accused, at the time of the alleged criminal conduct andas a result of such severe mental disease or defect, unable to appreciatethe nature and quality or wrongfulness of his or her conduct? Is the accused presently suffering from a mental disease or defectrendering the accused unable to understand the nature of the proceedingsagainst the accused or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense? 

 

Otherappropriate questions may also be included. Directions to board.In addition to the requirements specified in subsection (c)(2) of this rule, the order to the board shall specify: That upon completion of the board's investigation, a statementconsisting only of the board's ultimate conclusions as to all questions specifiedin the order shall be submitted to the officer ordering the examination, the accused's commanding officer, the preliminary hearing officer, if any, appointed pursuant to Article 32 and to all counsel in the case, the convening authority,and, after referral, to the military judge; That the full report of the board may be released by the board or other medical personnel only to other medical personnel for medical purposes,unless otherwise authorized by the convening authority or, after referral of charges, by the military judge, except that a copy of the full reportshall be furnished to the defense and, upon request, to the commanding officerof the accused; and That neither the contents of the full report nor any matter consideredby the board during its investigation shall be released by the board or othermedical personnel to any person not authorized to receive the full report, except pursuant to an order by the military judge.DiscussionBased on the report, further action in the case may be suspended,the charges may be dismissed by the convening authority, administrativeaction may be taken to discharge the accused from the service or, subjectto Mil. R. Evid. 302, the charges may be tried by court-martial.Additional examinations.Additional examinations may be directed under this rule at any stage of the proceedings as circumstances may require. Disclosure to trial counsel.No person, other than the defense counsel, accused, or, after referralof charges, the military judge may disclose to the trial counsel any statementmade by the accused to the board or any evidence derived from such statement.Discussion _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 302.Speedy trialIn general.The accused shall be brought to trial within 120 days after the earlier of: Preferral of charges;DiscussionDelay from the time of an offense to preferral of charges or the imposition of pretrial restraint is not considered for speedy trial purposes. _See also_ Article 43 (statute of limitations). In some circumstancessuch delay may prejudice the accused and may result in dismissal of thecharges or other relief. Offenses ordinarily should be disposed of promptlyto serve the interests of good order and discipline. Priority shall be givento persons in arrest or confinement.The imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4); orEntry on active duty under R.C.M. 204. Accountability.In general.The date of preferral of charges, the date on which pretrial restraintunder R.C.M. 304 (a)(2)-(4) is imposed, or the date of entry on active dutyunder R.C.M. 204 shall not count for purpose of computing time under subsection(a) of this rule. The date on which the accused is brought to trial shallcount. The accused is brought to trial within the meaning of this rule atthe time of arraignment under R.C.M. 904. Multiple Charges.When charges are preferred at different times, accountability for each charge shall be determined from the appropriate date under subsection(a) of this rule for that charge. Events which affect time periods.Dismissal or mistrial.If charges are dismissed, or if a mistrial is granted, a new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date of dismissal or mistrialfor cases in which there is no repreferral and cases in which the accusedis in pretrial restraint. In all other cases, a new 120-day time period underthe rule shall begin on the earlier of the date of repreferral; orthe date of imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4).Release from restraint.If the accused is released from pretrial restraint for a significant period, the 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the earlierof the date of preferral of charges; the date on which restraint under R.C.M. 304(a) (2)-(4) is reimposed; orthe date of entry on active duty under R.C.M. 204.Government appeals.If notice of appeal under R.C.M. 908 is filed, a new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin, for all charges neither proceeded onnor severed under R.C.M. 908(b)(4), on the date of notice to the parties under R.C.M. 908(b)(8) or 908(c)(3), unless it is determined that the appeal was filed solely for the purpose of delay with the knowledge that it wastotally frivolous and without merit. After the decision of the Court ofCriminal Appeals under R.C.M. 908, if there is a further appeal to the Courtof Appeals for the Armed Forces or, subsequently, to the Supreme Court, anew 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date the partiesare notified of the final decision of the Court of Appeals for the ArmedForces, or, if appropriate, the Supreme Court. Rehearings.If a rehearing is ordered or authorized by an appellate court, anew 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date that the responsibleconvening authority receives the record of trial and the opinion authorizingor directing a rehearing. An accused is brought to trial within the meaningof this rule at the time of arraignment under R.C.M. 904 or, if arraignmentis not required (such as in the case of a sentence-only rehearing), at thetime of the first session under R.C.M. 803.Commitment of the incompetent accused.If the accused is committed to the custody of the Attorney General for hospitalization as provided in R.C.M. 909(f), all periods of such commitmentshall be excluded when determining whether the period in subsection (a)of this rule has run. If, at the end of the period of commitment, the accusedis returned to the custody of the general court-martial convening authority,a new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date of suchreturn to custody. Excludable delay.All periods of time during which appellate courts have issued staysin the proceedings, or the accused is absent without authority, or the accusedis hospitalized due to incompetence, or is otherwise in the custody of theAttorney General, shall be excluded when determining whether the period insubsection (a) of this rule has run. All other pretrial delays approved bya military judge or the convening authority shall be similarly excluded.Procedure.Prior to referral, all requests for pretrial delay, together with supporting reasons, will be submitted to the convening authority or, ifauthorized under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, to amilitary judge for resolution. After referral, such requests for pretrial delay will be submitted to the military judge for resolution.DiscussionThe decision to grant or deny a reasonable delay is a matter within the sole discretion of the convening authority or a military judge. Thisdecision should be based on the facts and circumstances then and there existing.Reasons to grant a delay might, for example, include the need for: time toenable counsel to prepare for trial in complex cases; time to allow examinationinto the mental capacity of the accused; time to process a member of thereserve component to active duty for disciplinary action; time to complete other proceedings related to the case; time requested by the defense; timeto secure the availability of the accused, substantial witnesses, or otherevidence; time to obtain appropriate security clearances for access to classifiedinformation or time to declassify evidence; or additional time for othergood cause. 

 Pretrial delays should not be granted ex parte,and when practicable, the decision granting the delay, together with supportingreasons and the dates covering the delay, should be reduced to writing. 

 Priorto referral, the convening authority may delegate the authority to grantcontinuances to an Article 32 preliminary hearing officer.Motions.Upon accused's timely motion to a military judge under R.C.M. 905for speedy trial relief, counsel should provide the court a chronology detailingthe processing of the case. This chronology should be made a part of theappellate record. Remedy.A failure to comply with this rule will result in dismissal of theaffected charges, or, in a sentence-only rehearing, sentence relief as appropriate.Dismissal.Dismissal will be with or without prejudice to the government'sright to reinstitute court-martial proceedings against the accused for thesame offense at a later date. The charges must be dismissed with prejudicewhere the accused has been deprived of his or her constitutional right toa speedy trial. In determining whether to dismiss charges with or withoutprejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case thatlead to dismissal; the impact of a re-prosecution on the administration ofjustice; and any prejudice to the accused resulting from the denial of a speedytrial.Sentence relief.In determining whether or how much sentence relief is appropriate,the military judge shall consider, among others, each of the following factors:the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused's demand forspeedy trial, and any prejudice to the accused from the delay. Any sentencerelief granted will be applied against the sentence approved by the conveningauthority.Discussion_See_ subsection (c)(1) and the accompanying Discussionconcerning reasons for delay and procedures for parties to request delay.Waiver.Except as provided in R.C.M. 910(a)(2), a plea of guilty whichresults in a finding of guilty waives any speedy trial issue as to that offense.DiscussionSpeedy trial issues may also be waived by a failure to raise the issue at trial. _See_ R.C.M. 905(e) and 907(b)(2).TRIAL PROCEDURE GENERALLYMilitary judge's responsibilities; other mattersResponsibilities of military judge.The military judge is the presiding officer in a court-martial.DiscussionThe military judge is responsible for ensuring that court-martialproceedings are conducted in a fair and orderly manner, without unnecessarydelay or waste of time or resources. Unless otherwise specified, the presidentof a special court-martial without a military judge has the same authorityand responsibility as a military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 502(b)(2).The military judge shall:Determine the time and uniform for each session of a court-martial;DiscussionThe military judge should consult with counsel concerning the schedulingof sessions and the uniform to be worn. The military judge recesses or adjournsthe court-martial as appropriate. Subject to R.C.M. 504(d)(1), the militaryjudge may also determine the place of trial. _See also_ R.C.M.906(b)(11).Ensure that the dignity and decorum of the proceedings are maintained;Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 804 and 806. Courts-martial shouldbe conducted in an atmosphere which is conducive to calm and detached deliberationand determination of the issues presented and which reflects the seriousnessof the proceedings.Subject to the code and this Manual, exercise reasonable controlover the proceedings to promote the purposes of these rules and this Manual;Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 102. The military judge may, withinthe framework established by the code and this Manual, prescribe the mannerand order in which the proceedings may take place. Thus, the military judge may determine: when, and in what order, motions will be litigated (_see_ R.C.M. 905); the manner in which voir dire will be conductedand challenges made (_see_ R.C.M. 902(d) and 912); the order in which witnesses may testify (_see_ R.C.M. 913; Mil. R.Evid. 611); the order in which the parties may argue on a motion or objection;and the time limits for argument (_see_ R.C.M. 905; 919; 1001(g)). 

 Themilitary judge should prevent unnecessary waste of time and promote the ascertainment of truth, but must avoid undue interference with the parties' presentationsor the appearance of partiality. The parties are entitled to a reasonableopportunity to properly present and support their contentions on any relevantmatter.Subject to subsection (e) of this rule, rule on all interlocutoryquestions and all questions of law raised during the court-martial; andInstruct the members on questions of law and procedure which mayarise.DiscussionThe military judge instructs the members concerning findings(_see_ R.C.M. 920) and sentence (_see_ R.C.M. 1005),and when otherwise appropriate. For example, preliminary instructions tothe members concerning their duties and the duties of other trial participantsand other matters are normally appropriate. _See_ R.C.M. 913.Other instructions (for example, instructions on the limited purpose forwhich evidence has been introduced, _see_ Mil. R. Evid. 105)may be given whenever the need arises. In the case of a victim of an offense under the UCMJ who is under 18 years of age and not a member of the armed forces, or who is incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, designate in writing a family member, a representative of the estate of the victim, or another suitable individual to assume the victim's rights under the UCMJ.For the purposes of this rule, the individual is designated for the sole purpose of assuming the legal rights of the victim as they pertain to the victim's status as a victim of any offense(s) properly before the court.Discussion The rights that a designee may exercise on behalf of a victim include the right to receive notice of public hearings in the case; the right to be reasonably heard at such hearings, if permitted by law; and the right to confer with counsel representing the government at such hearings. The designee may also be the custodial guardian of the child.

 When determining whom to appoint under this rule, the military judge may consider the following: the age and maturity, relationship to the victim, and physical proximity of any proposed designee; the costs incurred in effecting the appointment; the willingness of the proposed designee to serve in such a role; the previous appointment of a guardian by another court of competent jurisdiction; the preference of the victim; any potential delay in any proceeding that may be caused by a specific appointment; and any other relevant information.Procedure to determine appointment of designee.As soon as practicable, trial counsel shall notify the military judge, counsel for the accused and the victim(s) of any offense(s) properly before the court when there is an apparent requirement to appoint a designee under this rule.Discussion In the event a case involves multiple victims who are entitled to notice under this rule, each victim is only entitled to notice relating to his or her own designated representative.The military judge will determine if the appointment of a designee is required under this rule.At the discretion of the military judge, victim(s), trial counsel, and the accused may be given the opportunity to recommend to the military judge individual(s) for appointment.The military judge is not required to hold a hearing before determining whether a designation is required or making such an appointment under this rule.If the military judge determines a hearing pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ, is necessary, the following shall be notified of the hearing and afforded the right to be present at the hearing: trial counsel, accused, and the victim(s).The individual designated shall not be the accused. At any time after appointment, a designee shall be excused upon request by the designee or a finding of good cause by the military judge.If the individual appointed to assume the victim's rights is excused, the military judge shall appoint a successor consistent with this rule.Discussion The term "victim of an offense under the UCMJ" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ. "Good Cause" means adequate or reasonable grounds to believe that the individual appointed to assume the victim's rights is not acting or does not intend to act in the best interest of the victim.Rules of court; contempt.The military judge may: Subject to R.C.M. 108, promulgate and enforce rules of court. Subject to R.C.M. 809, exercise contempt power. Obtaining evidence.The court-martial may act to obtain evidence in addition to that presented by the parties. The right of the members to have additional evidenceobtained is subject to an interlocutory ruling by the military judge.DiscussionThe members may request and the military judge may require thata witness be recalled, or that a new witness be summoned, or other evidenceproduced. The members or military judge may direct trial counsel to makean inquiry along certain lines to discover and produce additional evidence. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 614. In taking such action, the court-martialmust not depart from an impartial role.Uncharged offenses.If during the trial there is evidence that the accused may be guiltyof an untried offense not alleged in any specification before the court-martial,the court-martial shall proceed with the trial of the offense charged.DiscussionA report of the matter may be made to the convening authority aftertrial. If charges are preferred for an offense indicated by the evidencereferred to in this subsection, no member of the court-martial who participatedin the first trial should sit in any later trial. Such a member would ordinarilybe subject to a challenge for cause. _See_ R.C.M. 912. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 105 concerning instructing the members onevidence of uncharged misconduct.Interlocutory questions and questions of law.For purposes of this subsection "military judge" doesnot include the president of a special court-martial without a militaryjudge. Rulings by the military judge.Finality of rulings.Any ruling by the military judge upon a question of law, includinga motion for a finding of not guilty, or upon any interlocutory questionis final. Changing a ruling.The military judge may change a ruling made by that or anothermilitary judge in the case except a previously granted motion for a findingof not guilty, at any time during the trial. Article 39(a) sessions.When required by this Manual or otherwise deemed appropriate bythe military judge, interlocutory questions or questions of law shall bepresented and decided at sessions held without members under R.C.M. 803.DiscussionSessions without members are appropriate for interlocutory questions, questions of law, and instructions. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid.103; 304; 311; 321. Such sessions should be used to the extent possibleconsistent with the orderly, expeditious progress of the proceedings.Ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.Questions of law.Any ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a military judge on any question of law other than a motion for a findingof not guilty is final. Questions of fact.Any ruling by the president of a special court-martial without a military judge on any interlocutory question of fact, including a factualissue of mental capacity of the accused, or on a motion for a finding ofnot guilty, is final unless objected to by a member. Changing a ruling.The president of a special court-martial without a military judgemay change a ruling made by that or another president in the case excepta previously granted motion for a finding of not guilty, at any time during the trial. Presence of members.Except as provided in R.C.M. 505 and 912, all members will be present at all sessions of a special court-martial without a military judge, includingsessions at which questions of law or interlocutory questions are litigated.However, the president of a special court-martial without a military judgemay examine an offered item of real or documentary evidence before rulingon its admissibility without exposing it to other members. Procedures for rulings by the president of a special court-martial without a military judge which are subject to objection by a member.Determination.The president of a special court-martial without a military judge shall determine whether a ruling is subject to objection. Instructions.When a ruling by the president of a special court-martial withouta military judge is subject to objection, the president shall so advisethe members and shall give such instructions on the issue as may be necessaryto enable the members to understand the issue and the legal standards bywhich they will determine it if objection is made. Voting.When a member objects to a ruling by the president of a specialcourt-martial without a military judge which is subject to objection, thecourt-martial shall be closed, and the members shall vote orally, beginning with the junior in rank, and the question shall be decided by a majorityvote. A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty is a determinationagainst the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determinationin favor of the accused. Consultation.The president of a special court-martial without a military judgemay close the court-martial and consult with other members before rulingon a matter, when such ruling is subject to the objection of any member.Standard of proof.Questions of fact in an interlocutory question shall be determinedby a preponderance of the evidence, unless otherwise stated in this Manual.In the absence of a rule in this Manual assigning the burden of persuasion, the party making the motion or raising the objection shall bear the burdenof persuasion.DiscussionA ruling on an interlocutory question should be preceded by anynecessary inquiry into the pertinent facts and law. For example, the partymaking the objection, motion, or request may be required to furnish evidenceor legal authority in support of the contention. An interlocutory issue mayhave a different standard of proof. _See_, for example, Mil.R. Evid. 314(e)(5), which requires consent for a search to be proved by clearand convincing evidence. 

 Most of the common motions arediscussed in specific rules in this Manual, and the burden of persuasionis assigned therein. The prosecution usually bears the burden of persuasion(_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 304(e); 311(e); _see also_ R.C.M.905 through 907) once an issue has been raised. What "raises"an issue may vary with the issue. Some issues may be raised by a timely motionor objection. _See_, for example, Mil. R. Evid. 304(e). Othersmay not be raised until the defense has made an offer of proof or presentedevidence in support of its position. _See_, for example, Mil.R. Evid. 311(g)(2). The rules in this Manual and relevant decisions shouldbe consulted when a question arises as to whether an issue is raised, aswell as which side has the burden of persuasion. The military judge or presidentof a special court-martial may require a party to clarify a motion or objectionor to make an offer of proof, regardless of the burden of persuasion, whenit appears that the motion or objection is vague, inapposite, irrelevant,or spurious.Scope.Subsection (e) of this rule applies to the disposition of questionsof law and interlocutory questions arising during trial except the questionwhether a challenge should be sustained.DiscussionQuestions of law and interlocutory questions include all issueswhich arise during trial other than the findings (that is, guilty or notguilty), sentence, and administrative matters such as declaring recesses and adjournments. A question may be both interlocutory and a question of law.Challenges are specifically covered in R.C.M. 902 and 912. 

 Questionsof the applicability of a rule of law to an undisputed set of facts are normally questions of law. Similarly, the legality of an act is normally a questionof law. For example, the legality of an order when disobedience of an orderis charged, the legality of restraint when there is a prosecution for breachof arrest, or the sufficiency of warnings before interrogation are normallyquestions of law. It is possible, however, for such questions to be decidedsolely upon some factual issue, in which case they would be questions offact. For example, the question of what warnings, if any, were given by aninterrogator to a suspect would be a factual question. 

 Aquestion is interlocutory unless the ruling on it would finally decide whetherthe accused is guilty. Questions which may determine the ultimate issue ofguilt are not interlocutory. An issue may arise as both an interlocutoryquestion and a question which may determine the ultimate issue of guilt. An issued is not purely interlocutory if an accused raises a defense or objectionand the disputed facts involved determine the ultimate question of guilt.For example, if during a trial for desertion the accused moves to dismissfor lack of jurisdiction and presents some evidence that the accused is nota member of an armed force, the accused's status as a military person maydetermine the ultimate question of guilt because status is an element ofthe offense. If the motion is denied, the disputed facts must be resolvedby each member in deliberation upon the findings. (The accused's status asa servicemember would have to be proved by a preponderance of the evidenceto uphold jurisdiction, _ see_ R.C.M. 907, but beyond a reasonabledoubt to permit a finding of guilty.) If, on the other hand, the accusedwas charged with larceny and presented the same evidence as to military status,the evidence would bear only upon amenability to trial and the issue wouldbe disposed of solely as an interlocutory question. 

 Interlocutoryquestions may be questions of fact or questions of law. This distinction isimportant because the president of a special court-martial without a militaryjudge rules finally on interlocutory questions of law, but not on interlocutoryquestions of fact. On interlocutory questions of fact the president of aspecial court-martial without a military judge rules subject to the objectionof any other member. On mixed questions of fact and law, rulings by the presidentare subject to objection by any member to the extent that the issue of factcan be isolated and considered separately.Rulings on record.All sessions involving rulings or instructions made or given bythe military judge or the president of a special court-martial without amilitary judge shall be made a part of the record. All rulings and instructionsshall be made or given in open session in the presence of the parties andthe members, except as otherwise may be determined in the discretion of themilitary judge. For purposes of this subsection --LSQP--R.C.M. 801(f)--RSQP--"military judge" does not include the president of a specialcourt-martial without a military judge.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 808 and 1103 concerning preparationof the record of trial.Effect of failure to raise defenses or objections.Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requestsor motions which must be made at the time set by this Manual or by the militaryjudge under authority of this Manual, or prior to any extension thereof madeby the military judge, shall constitute waiver thereof, but the military judgefor good cause shown may grant relief from the waiver. ConferencesIn general.After referral, the military judge may, upon request of any partyor _sua sponte_, order one or more conferences with the partiesto consider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial. DiscussionConferences between the military judge and counsel may be held whennecessary before or during trial. The purpose of such conference is to informthe military judge of anticipated issues and to expeditiously resolve matterson which the parties can agree, not to litigate or decide contested issues. _See_ subsection (c) below. No party may be compelled to resolve anymatter at a conference. 

 A conference may be appropriatein order to resolve scheduling difficulties, so that witnesses and membersare not unnecessarily inconvenienced. Matters which will ultimately be inthe military judge's discretion, such as conduct of voir dire, seating arrangementsin the courtroom, or procedures when there are multiple accused may be resolvedat a conference. Conferences may be used to advise the military judge of issues or problems, such as unusual motions or objections, which are likely to ariseduring trial. 

 Occasionally it may be appropriate to resolvecertain issues, in addition to routine or administrative matters, if thiscan be done with the consent of the parties. For example, a request for awitness which, if litigated and approved at trial, would delay the proceedingsand cause expense or inconvenience, might be resolved at a conference. Note,however, that this could only be done by an agreement of the parties andnot by a binding ruling of the military judge. Such a resolution must be includedin the record. _See_ subsection (b) below. 

 Amilitary judge may not participate in negotiations relating to pleas. _See_ R.C.M. 705 and Mil. R. Evid. 410. 

 No placeor method is prescribed for conducting a conference.A conference may be conducted by remote means or similar technology consistent with the definition in R.C.M. 914B. Matters on record.Conferences need not be made part of the record, but matters agreedupon at a conference shall be included in the record orally or in writing.Failure of a party to object at trial to failure to comply with this subsection shall waive this requirement. Rights of parties.No party may be prevented under this rule from presenting evidenceor from making any argument, objection, or motion at trial. Accused's presence.The presence of the accused is neither required nor prohibited ata conference.DiscussionNormally the defense counsel may be presumed to speak for the accused.Admission.No admissions made by the accused or defense counsel at a conferenceshall be used against the accused unless the admissions are reduced to writingand signed by the accused and defense counsel. Limitations.This rule shall not be invoked in the case of an accused who isnot represented by counsel, or in special court-martial without a militaryjudge. Court-martial sessions without members under Article 39(a)A military judge who has been detailed to the court-martial may,under Article 39(a), after service of charges, call the court-martial intosession without the presence of members. Such sessions may be held beforeand after assembly of the court-martial, and when authorized in these rules,after adjournment and before action by the convening authority. All suchsessions are a part of the trial and shall be conducted in the presence ofthe accused, defense counsel, and trial counsel, in accordance with R.C.M.804 and 805, and shall be made a part of the record. For purposes of thisrule "military judge" does not include the president of a specialcourt-martial without a military judge.DiscussionThe purpose of Article 39(a) is "to give statutory sanctionto pretrial and other hearings without the presence of the members concerningthose matters which are amenable to disposition on either a tentative orfinal basis by the military judge." The military judge and members may,and ordinarily should, call the court-martial into session without membersto ascertain the accused's understanding of the right to counsel, the rightto request trial by military judge alone, or when applicable, enlisted members,and the accused's choices with respect to these matters; dispose of interlocutorymatters; hear objections and motions; rule upon other matters that may legallybe ruled upon by the military judge, such as admitting evidence; and performother procedural functions which do not require the presence of members. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 901-910. The military judge may, ifpermitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned, hold the arraignment,receive pleas, and enter findings of guilty upon an accepted plea of guilty. 

 Evidencemay be admitted and process, including a subpoena, may be issued to compelattendance of witnesses and production of evidence at such sessions. _See_ R.C.M. 703. 

 Article 39(a) authorizes sessionsonly after charges have been referred to trial and served on the accused,but the accused has an absolute right to object, in time of peace, to anysession until the period prescribed by Article 35 has run. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 804 concerning waiver by the accused of the right to bepresent. _See also_ R.C.M. 802 concerning conferences.Presence of the accused at trial proceedingsPresence required.The accused shall be present at the arraignment, the time of theplea, every stage of the trial including sessions conducted under Article39(a), voir dire and challenges of members, the return of the findings, sentencingproceedings, and post-trial sessions, if any, except as otherwise providedby this rule. Presence by remote means.If authorized by the regulations of the Secretary concerned, the military judge may order the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology, between the parties and the military judge for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions. Use of such audiovisual technology will satisfy the "presence" requirement of the accused only when the accused has a defense counsel physically present at his location. Such technology may include two or more remote sites as long as all parties can see and hear each other.Continued presence not required.The further progress of the trial to and including the return ofthe findings and, if necessary, determination of a sentence shall not beprevented and the accused shall be considered to have waived the right tobe present whenever an accused, initially present: Is voluntarily absent after arraignment (whether or not informedby the military judge of the obligation to remain during the trial); orAfter being warned by the military judge that disruptive conductwill cause the accused to be removed from the courtroom, persists in conductwhich is such as to justify exclusion from the courtroom.Discussion_Express waiver._ The accused may expressly waivethe right to be present at trial proceedings. There is no right to be absent,however, and the accused may be required to be present over objection. Thus,an accused cannot frustrate efforts to identify the accused at trial by waivingthe right to be present. The right to be present is so fundamental, and theGovernment's interest in the attendance of the accused so substantial, thatthe accused should be permitted to waive the right to be present only forgood cause, and only after the military judge explains to the accused theright, and the consequences of foregoing it, and secures the accused's personalconsent to proceeding without the accused. 

 _Voluntaryabsence._ In any case the accused may forfeit the right to be present by being voluntarily absent after arraignment. 

 "Voluntaryabsence" means voluntary absence from trial. For an absence from court-martial proceedings to be voluntary, the accused must have known of the scheduledproceedings and intentionally missed them. For example, although an accusedservicemember might voluntarily be absent without authority, this would notjustify proceeding with a court-martial in the accused's absence unless theaccused was aware that the court-martial would be held during the periodof the absence. 

 An accused who is in military custody orotherwise subject to military control at the time of trial or other proceedingmay not properly be absent from the trial or proceeding without securing thepermission of the military judge on the record. 

 The prosecutionhas the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the accused'sabsence from trial is voluntary. Voluntariness may not be presumed, but itmay be inferred, depending on the circumstances. For example, it may be inferred,in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that an accused who was presentwhen the trial recessed and who knew when the proceedings were scheduled toresume, but who nonetheless is not present when court reconvenes at the designatedtime, is absent voluntarily. 

 Where there is some evidencethat an accused who is absent for a hearing or trial may lack mental capacityto stand trial, capacity to voluntarily waive the right to be present fortrial must be shown. _See_ R.C.M. 909. 

 Subsection(1) authorizes but does not require trial to proceed in the absence of the accused upon the accused's voluntary absence. When an accused is absent fromtrial after arraignment, a continuance or a recess may be appropriate, dependingon all the circumstances.

 Presence of the accused by remote means does not require the consent of the accused.

 _Removal for disruption._ Trial may proceed without the presence of an accused who has disruptedthe proceedings, but only after at least one warning by the military judgethat such behavior may result in removal from the courtroom. In order tojustify removal from the proceedings, the accused's behavior should be of such a nature as to materially interfere with the conduct of the proceedings. 

 Themilitary judge should consider alternatives to removal of a disruptive accused.Such alternatives include physical restraint (such as binding, shackling,and gagging) of the accused, or physically segregating the accused in thecourtroom. Such alternatives need not be tried before removing a disruptiveaccused under subsection (2). Removal may be preferable to such an alternativeas binding and gagging, which can be an affront to the dignity and decorumof the proceedings. 

 Disruptive behavior of the accused mayalso constitute contempt. _See_ R.C.M. 809. When the accusedis removed from the courtroom for disruptive behavior, the military judgeshould-Afford the accused and defense counsel ample opportunity to consultthroughout the proceedings. To this end, the accused should be held or otherwiserequired to remain in the vicinity of the trial, and frequent recesses permittedto allow counsel to confer with the accused.Take such additional steps as may be reasonably practicable to enablethe accused to be informed about the proceedings. Although not required,technological aids, such as closed-circuit television or audio transmissions,may be used for this purpose.Afford the accused a continuing opportunity to return to the courtroomupon assurance of good behavior. To this end, the accused should be broughtto the courtroom at appropriate intervals, and offered the opportunity toremain upon good behavior.Ensure that the reasons for removal appear in the record.Voluntary absence for limited purpose of child testimony.Election by accused.Following a determination by the military judge that remote livetestimony of a child is appropriate pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 611(d)(3),the accused may elect to voluntarily absent himself from the courtroom inorder to preclude the use of procedures described in R.C.M. 914A. Procedure.The accused's absence will be conditional upon his being able to view the witness' testimony from a remote location. Normally, transmission of the testimony will include a system that will transmit the accused's image and voice into the courtroom from a remote location as well as transmission of the child's testimony from the courtroom to the accused's location. A one-way transmission may be used if deemed necessary by the military judge. The accused will also be provided private, contemporaneous communication with his counsel. The procedures described herein shall be employed unless the accused has made a knowing and affirmative waiver of these procedures.Effect on accused's rights generally.An election by the accused to be absent pursuant to subsection (c)(1)shall not otherwise affect the accused's right to be present at the remainderof the trial in accordance with this rule. Appearance and security of accused.Appearance.The accused shall be properly attired in the uniform or dress prescribedby the military judge. An accused servicemember shall wear the insignia ofgrade and may wear any decorations, emblems, or ribbons to which entitled.The accused and defense counsel are responsible for ensuring that the accusedis properly attired; however, upon request, the accused's commander shallrender such assistance as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that theaccused is properly attired.DiscussionThis subsection recognizes the right, as well as the obligation,of an accused servicemember to present a good military appearance at trial.An accused servicemember who refuses to present a proper military appearancebefore a court-martial may be compelled to do so.Custody.Responsibility for maintaining custody or control of an accusedbefore and during trial may be assigned, subject to R.C.M. 304 and 305, andsubsection (c)(3) of this rule, under such regulations as the Secretary concernedmay prescribe. Restraint.Physical restraint shall not be imposed on the accused during opensessions of the court-martial unless prescribed by the military judge. Presence of military judge, members, and counselMilitary judge.No court-martial proceeding, except the deliberations of the members,may take place in the absence of the military judge, if detailed. If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions solely, the presence of the military judge at Article 39(a) sessions may be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology.Members.Unless trial is by military judge alone pursuant to a request bythe accused, no court-martial proceeding may take place in the absence ofany detailed member except: Article 39(a) sessions under R.C.M. 803; examination of members under R.C.M. 912(d); when the member has been excused under R.C.M.505 or 912(f); or as otherwise provided in R.C.M. 1102. No general court-martial proceeding requiring the presence of members may be conducted unless at least five members are present, or in capital cases, at least 12 members are present except as provided in R.C.M. 501(a)(1)(B), where 12 members are not reasonably available because of physical conditions or military exigencies. No special court-martial proceeding requiring the presence of members may be conducted unless at least three members are present except as provided in R.C.M. 912(h). Except as provided in R.C.M. 503(a)(2),when an enlisted accused has requested enlisted members, no proceeding requiring the presence of members may be conducted unless at least one-third of themembers actually sitting on the court-martial are enlisted persons. Counsel.As long as at least one qualified counsel for each party is present,other counsel for each party may be absent from a court-martial session.An assistant counsel who lacks the qualifications necessary to serve as counselfor a party may not act at a session in the absence of such qualified counsel. If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions solely, the presence of counsel at Article 39(a) sessions may be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology. At least one qualified defense counsel shall be physically present with the accused.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 504(d) concerning qualifications ofcounsel. 

 Ordinarily, no court-martial proceeding shouldtake place if any defense or assistant defense counsel is absent unless theaccused expressly consents to the absence. The military judge may, howeverproceed in the absence of one or more defense counsel, without the consentof the accused, if the military judge finds that, under the circumstances,a continuance is not warranted and that the accused's right to be adequately represented would not be impaired. 

 _See_ R.C.M.502(d)(6) and 505(d)(2) concerning withdrawal or substitution of counsel. _See_ R.C.M. 506(d) concerning the right of the accused to proceedwithout counsel.Effect of replacement of member or military judge.Members.When after presentation of evidence on the merits has begun, a newmember is detailed under R.C.M. 505(c)(2)(B), trial may not proceed unlessthe testimony and evidence previously admitted on the merits, if recordedverbatim, is read to the new member, or, if not recorded verbatim, and inthe absence of a stipulation as to such testimony and evidence, the trialproceeds as if no evidence has been presented.DiscussionWhen a new member is detailed, the military judge should give such instructions as may be appropriate. _See also_ R.C.M. 912 concerning voir dire and challenges.

 When the court-martial has been reduced below a quorum, a mistrial may be appropriate. See _R.C.M._ 915.Military judge.When, after the presentation of evidence on the merits has begunin trial before military judge alone, a new military judge is detailed underR.C.M. 505(e)(2) trial may not proceed unless the accused requests, and themilitary judge approves, trial by military judge alone, and a verbatim recordof the testimony and evidence or a stipulation thereof is read to the militaryjudge, or the trial proceeds as if no evidence had been presented. Public trialIn general.Except as otherwise provided in this rule, courts-martial shallbe open to the public. For purposes of this rule, "public" includesmembers of both the military and civilian communities.DiscussionBecause of the requirement for public trials, courts-martial mustbe conducted in facilities which can accommodate a reasonable number of spectators.Military exigencies may occasionally make attendance at courts-martial difficultor impracticable, as, for example, when a court-martial is conducted on aship at sea or in a unit in a combat zone. This does not violate this rule.However, such exigencies should not be manipulated to prevent attendanceat a court-martial. The requirements of this rule may be met even thoughonly servicemembers are able to attend a court-martial. Although not required,servicemembers should be encouraged to attend courts-martial. 

 Whenpublic access to a court-martial is limited for some reason, including lackof space, special care must be taken to avoid arbitrary exclusion of specificgroups or persons. This may include allocating a reasonable number of seatsto members of the press and to relatives of the accused, and establishingprocedures for entering and exiting from the courtroom. _See also_ subsection (b) below. There is no requirement that there actuallybe spectators at a court-martial. 

 The fact that a trialis conducted with members does not make it a public trial.Control of spectators and closure.Control of spectators.In order to maintain the dignity and decorum of the proceedingsor for other good cause, the military judge may reasonably limit the numberof spectators in, and the means of access to, the courtroom, and excludespecific persons from the courtroom. When excluding specific persons, themilitary judge must make findings on the record establishing the reason forthe exclusion, the basis for the military judge's belief that exclusion isnecessary, and that the exclusion is as narrowly tailored as possible.Discussion The military judge must ensure that the dignity and decorum of the proceedings are maintained and that the other rights and interests of the parties and society are protected. Public access to a session may be limited, specific persons may be excluded from the courtroom, and, under unusual circumstances, a session may be closed.

 Exclusion of specific persons, if unreasonable under the circumstances, may violate the accused's right to a public trial, even though other spectators remain. Whenever specific persons or some members of the public are excluded, exclusion must be limited in time and scope to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is ordered. Prevention of overcrowding or noise may justify limiting access to the courtroom. Disruptive or distracting appearance or conduct may justify excluding specific persons. Specific persons may be excluded when necessary to protect witnesses from harm or intimidation. Access may be reduced when no other means is available to relieve a witness' inability to testify due to embarrassment or extreme nervousness. Witnesses will ordinarily be excluded from the courtroom so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 615.

 For purposes of this rule, the term "victim of an alleged offense" means a person who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense under the UCMJ.Right of victim to attend.A victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused may not be excluded from a court-martial relating to the offense unless the military judge, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that hearing or proceeding. The right to attend requires reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of a court-martial relating to the offense.Right of victim to confer. A victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused has the reasonable right to confer with the trial counsel.Closure.Courts-martial shall be open to the public unless (1) there is asubstantial probability that an overriding interest will be prejudiced ifthe proceedings remain open; (2) closure is no broader than necessary to protectthe overriding interest; (3) reasonable alternatives to closure were consideredand found inadequate; and (4) the military judge makes case-specific findingson the record justifying closure.DiscussionThe military judge is responsible for protecting both the accused'sright to, and the public's interest in, a public trial. A court-martial sessionis "closed" when no member of the public is permitted to attend. A court-martial is not "closed" merely because the exclusionof certain individuals results in there being no spectators present, as longas the exclusion is not so broad as to effectively bar everyone who mightattend the sessions and is put into place for a proper purpose.

 A session may be closed over the objection of the accused or the public uponmeeting the constitutional standard set forth in this Rule. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 412(c), 505(i), and 513(e)(2).

 Theaccused may waive his right to a public trial. The fact that the prosecutionand defense jointly seek to have a session closed does not, however, automaticallyjustify closure, for the public has a right in attending courts-martial.Opening trials to public scrutiny reduces the chance of arbitrary and capriciousdecisions and enhances public confidence in the court-martial process.

 The most likely reason for a defense request to close court-martial proceedingsis to minimize the potentially adverse effect of publicity on the trial.For example, a pretrial Article 39(a) hearing at which the admissibility ofa confession will be litigated may, under some circumstances, be closed, inaccordance with this Rule, in order to prevent disclosure to the public (andhence to potential members) of the very evidence that may be excluded. Whensuch publicity may be a problem, a session should be closed only as a lastresort.

 There are alternative means of protecting theproceedings from harmful effects of publicity, including a thorough _voir dire_ (_see_ R.C.M. 912), and, if necessary, acontinuance to allow the harmful effects of publicity to dissipate(_see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(1)). Alternatives that may occasionally be appropriateand are usually preferable to closing a session include: directing membersnot to read, listen to, or watch any accounts concerning the case; issuinga protective order (_see_ R.C.M. 806(d)); selecting membersfrom recent arrivals in the command, or from outside the immediate area(_see_ R.C.M. 503(a)(3)); changing the place of trial(_see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(11)); or sequestering the members. Photography and broadcasting prohibited.Video and audio recording and the taking of photographs-except for the purpose of preparing the record of trial-in the courtroom during the proceedings and radio or television broadcasting of proceedings fromthe courtroom shall not be permitted. However, the military judge may, asa matter of discretion permit contemporaneous closed-circuit video or audiotransmission to permit viewing or hearing by an accused removed under R.C.M.804 or by spectators when courtroom facilities are inadequate to accommodatea reasonable number of spectators.Protective orders.The military judge may, upon request of any party or _sua sponte_, issue an appropriate protective order, in writing, to preventparties and witnesses from making extrajudicial statements that presenta substantial likelihood of material prejudice to a fair trial by impartial members. For purposes of this subsection, "military judge" doesnot include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.Discussion A protective order may proscribe extrajudicial statements by counsel, parties, and witnesses that might divulge prejudicial matternot of public record in the case. Other appropriate matters may also be addressedby such a protective order. Before issuing a protective order, the militaryjudge must consider whether other available remedies would effectively mitigatethe adverse effects that any publicity might create, and consider such anorder's likely effectiveness in ensuring an impartial court-martial panel.A military judge should not issue a protective order without first providingnotice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard. The military judgemust state on the record the reasons for issuing the protective order. Ifthe reasons for issuing the order change, the military judge may reconsiderthe continued necessity for a protective order.OathsDefinition."Oath" includes "affirmation."DiscussionAn affirmation is the same as an oath, except in an affirmationthe words "so help you God" are omitted.Oaths in courts-martial.Who must be sworn.Court-martial personnel.The military judge, members of a general or special court-martial, trial counsel, assistant trial counsel, defense counsel, associate defense counsel, assistant defense counsel, reporter, interpreter, and escort shalltake an oath to perform their duties faithfully. For purposes of this rule, "defense counsel," "associate defense counsel," and "assistant defense counsel," include detailed and individualmilitary and civilian counsel.DiscussionArticle 42(a) provides that regulations of the Secretary concerned shall prescribe: the form of the oath; the time and place of the taking thereof; the manner of recording it; and whether the oath shall be takenfor all cases in which the duties are to be performed or in each case separately.In the case of certified legal personnel (Article 26(b); Article 27(b)) these regulations may provide for the administration of an oath on a one-timebasis. _See also_ R.C.M. 813 and 901 concerning the pointin the proceedings at which it is ordinarily determined whether the requiredoaths have been taken or are then administered.Witnesses.Each witness before a court-martial shall be examined on oath.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 307 concerning the requirement for an oath in preferral of charges. _See_ R.C.M. 405 and 702 concerning the requirements for an oath in Article 32 preliminary hearings and depositions.

 An accused making an unsworn statement is not a "witness." _See_ R.C.M. 1001(c)(2)(C).

 A victim of an offense of which the accused has been found guilty is not a "witness" when making an unsworn statement during the presentencing phase of a court-martial. _See_ R.C.M. 1001A.Procedure for administering oaths.Any procedure which appeals to the conscience of the person to whom the oath is administered and which binds that person to speak the truth,or, in the case of one other than a witness, properly to perform certainduties, is sufficient.DiscussionWhen the oath is administered in a session to the military judge, members, or any counsel, all persons in the courtroom should stand. In thoserare circumstances in which the trial counsel testifies as a witness, themilitary judge administers the oath. 

 Unless otherwise prescribedby the Secretary concerned the forms below may be used, as appropriate,to administer an oath.Oath for military judge.When the military judge is not previously sworn, the trial counselwill administer the following oath to the military judge: "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully and impartially perform, according to your conscience and the laws applicableto trial by court-martial, all the duties incumbent upon you as militaryjudge of this court-martial (,so help you God)?"Oath for members.The following oath, as appropriate, will be administered to themembers by the trial counsel: "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will answer truthfully the questions concerning whether you should serve as a memberof this court-martial; that you will faithfully and impartially try, according to the evidence, your conscience, and the laws applicable to trial by court-martial,the case of the accused now before this court; and that you will not discloseor discover the vote or opinion of any particular member of the court (upona challenge or) upon the findings or sentence unless required to do so indue course of law (,so help you God)?"Oaths for counsel.When counsel for either side, including any associate or assistant,is not previously sworn the following oath, as appropriate, will be administeredby the military judge: "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully perform all the duties of (trial) (assistant trial) (defense)(associatedefense) (assistant defense) counsel in the case now in hearing (,so helpyou God)?"Oath for reporter.The trial counsel will administer the following oath to every reporterof a court-martial who has not been previously sworn: "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully perform the duties of reporter to this court-martial (,so help you God)?"Oath for interpreter.The trial counsel or the summary court-martial shall administerthe following oath to every interpreter in the trial of any case before a court-martial: "Do you (swear) (affirm) that in the case nowin hearing you will interpret truly the testimony you are called upon tointerpret (,so help you God)?"Oath for witnesses.The trial counsel or the summary court-martial will administerthe following oath to each witness before the witness first testifies ina case:  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you shall give in the case now in hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth,and nothing but the truth (,so help you God)?"Oath for escort.The escort on views or inspections by the court-martial will, beforeserving, take the following oath, which will be administered by the trialcounsel:  "Do you (swear) (affirm) that you will escortthe court-martial and will well and truly point out to them (the place inwhich the offense charged in this case is alleged to have been committed) (); and that you will not speak to the members concerning(the alleged offense) (), except to describe (theplace aforesaid) () (,so help you God)?" 

 _See_ Article 136 concerning persons authorized to administer oaths. Record of trialThe trial counsel of a general or special court-martial shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that a record which will meetthe requirements of R.C.M. 1103 can be prepared.DiscussionExcept in a special court-martial not authorized to adjudge a bad-conductdischarge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay formore than six months, the trial counsel should ensure that a qualified courtreporter is detailed to the court-martial. Trial counsel should also ensurethat all exhibits and other documents relating to the case are properly maintainedfor later inclusion in the record. _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(j)as to the use of videotapes, audiotapes, and similar recordings for the recordof trial. Because of the potential requirement for a verbatim transcript,all proceedings, including sidebar conferences, arguments, and rulings andinstructions by the military judge, should be recorded. 

 Wherethere is recorder failure or loss of court reporter's notes, the record shouldbe reconstructed as completely as possible. _See also_ R.C.M.1103(f). If the interruption is discovered during trial, the military judgeshould summarize or reconstruct the portion of the proceedings which hasnot been recorded and then proceed anew and repeat the proceedings from thepoint where the interruption began.

 _See_ R.C.M. 1305 concerning the record of trial in summary courts-martial.

 _See_ DD Forms 490 (Record of Trial), 491 (Summarized Record of Trial),and 491-1 (Summarized Record of Trial-Article 39(a) Session).Contempt proceedingsIn general.Courts-martial may exercise contempt power under Article 48.Discussion Article 48 makes punishable "direct" contempt, as well as "indirect" or "constructive" contempt. "Direct" contempt is that which is committed in the presence of the court-martial or its immediate proximity. "Presence" includes those places outside the courtroom itself, such as waiting areas, deliberation rooms, and other places set aside for the use of the court-martial while it is in session. "Indirect" or "constructive" contempt is non-compliance with lawful writs, processes, orders, rules, decrees, or commands of the court-martial. A "direct" or "indirect" contempt may be actually seen or heard by the court-martial, in which case it may be punished summarily. _See_ subsection (b)(1) below. A "direct" or "indirect" contempt may also be a contempt not actually observed by the court-martial, for example, when an unseen person makes loud noises, whether inside or outside the courtroom, which impede the orderly progress of the proceedings. In such a case the procedures for punishing for contempt are more extensive. _See_ subsection (b)(2) below.

 The words "any person," as used in Article 48, include all persons, whether or not subject to military law, except the military judge, members, and foreign nationals outside the territorial limits of the United States who are not subject to the code. The military judge may order the offender removed whether or not contempt proceedings are held. It may be appropriate to warn a person whose conduct is improper that persistence in a course of behavior may result in removal or punishment for contempt. _See_ R.C.M. 804, 806.

 Each contempt may be separately punished.

 A person subject to the code who commits contempt may be tried by court-martial or otherwise disciplined under Article 134 for such misconduct in addition to or instead of punishment for contempt. _See_ paragraph 108, Part IV; _see also_ Article 98. The 2011 amendment of Article 48 expanded the contempt power of military courts to enable them to enforce orders, such as discovery orders or protective orders regarding evidence, against military or civilian attorneys. Persons not subject to military jurisdiction under Article 2, having been duly subpoenaed, may be prosecuted in Federal civilian court under Article 47 for neglect or refusal to appear or refusal to qualify as a witness or to testify or to produce evidence.Method of disposition.Summary disposition.When conduct constituting contempt is directly witnessed by the court-martial, the conduct may be punished summarily. Disposition upon notice and hearing.When the conduct apparently constituting contempt is not directly witnessed by the court-martial, the alleged offender shall be brought beforethe court-martial and informed orally or in writing of the alleged contempt. The alleged offender shall be given a reasonable opportunity to presentevidence, including calling witnesses. The alleged offender shall have theright to be represented by counsel and shall be so advised. The contemptmust be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before it may be punished. Procedure.The military judge shall in all cases determine whether to punishfor contempt and, if so, what the punishment shall be. The military judgeshall also determine when during the court-martial the contempt proceedingsshall be conducted; however, if the court-martial is composed of members,the military judge shall conduct the contempt proceedings outside the members'presence. The military judge may punish summarily under subsection (b)(1)only if the military judge recites the facts for the record and states thatthey were directly witnessed by the military judge in the actual presenceof the court-martial. Otherwise, the provisions of subsection (b)(2) shallapply.Record; review.A record of the contempt proceedings shall be part of the recordof the court-martial during which it occurred. If the person was held incontempt, then a separate record of the contempt proceedings shall be preparedand forwarded to the convening authority for review. The convening authoritymay approve or disapprove all or part of the sentence. The action of theconvening authority is not subject to further review or appeal. Sentence.A sentence of confinement pursuant to a finding of contempt shall begin to run when it is adjudged unless deferred, suspended, or disapprovedby the convening authority. The place of confinement for a civilian or militaryperson who is held in contempt and is to be punished by confinement shallbe designated by the convening authority. A fine does not become effectiveuntil ordered executed by the convening authority. The military judge maydelay announcing the sentence after a finding of contempt to permit the personinvolved to continue to participate in the proceedings.DiscussionThe immediate commander of the person held in contempt, or, in the case of a civilian, the convening authority should be notified immediatelyso that the necessary action on the sentence may be taken. _See_R.C.M. 1101.Informing person held in contempt.The person held in contempt shall be informed by the conveningauthority in writing of the holding and sentence, if any, of the court-martialand of the action of the convening authority upon the sentence.DiscussionCopies of this communication should be furnished to such otherpersons including the immediate commander of the offender as may be concernedwith the execution of the punishment. A copy shall be included with therecord of both the trial and the contempt proceeding.Procedures for rehearings, new trials, and other trialsIn general.Rehearings in full and new or other trials.In rehearings which require findings on all charges and specificationsreferred to a court-martial and in new or other trials, the procedure shallbe the same as in an original trial except as otherwise provided in thisrule. Rehearings on sentence only.In a rehearing on sentence only, the procedure shall be the sameas in an original trial, except that the portion of the procedure whichordinarily occurs after challenges and through and including the findings is omitted, and except as otherwise provided in this rule. Contents of the record.The contents of the record of the original trial consisting ofevidence properly admitted on the merits relating to each offense of whichthe accused stands convicted but not sentenced may be established by anyparty whether or not testimony so read is otherwise admissible under Mil.R. Evid. 804(b)(1) and whether or not it was given through an interpreter.DiscussionMatters excluded from the record of the original trial on the merits or improperly admitted on the merits must not be brought to the attentionof the members as a part of the original record of trial.Plea.The accused at a rehearing only on sentence may not withdraw anyplea of guilty upon which findings of guilty are based. However, if sucha plea is found to be improvident, the rehearing shall be suspended and thematter reported to the authority ordering the rehearing. Combined rehearings.When a rehearing on sentence is combined with a trial on the merits of one or more specifications referred to the court-martial, whether ornot such specifications are being tried for the first time or reheard, thetrial will proceed first on the merits, without reference to the offensesbeing reheard on sentence only. After findings on the merits are announced,the members, if any, shall be advised of the offenses on which the rehearingon sentence has been directed. Additional challenges for cause may be permitted,and the sentencing procedure shall be the same as at an original trial,except as otherwise provided in this rule. A single sentence shall be adjudgedfor all offenses. Composition.Members.No member of the court-martial which previously heard the case may sit as a member of the court-martial at any rehearing, new trial, or othertrial of the same case. Military judge.The military judge at a rehearing may be the same military judgewho presided over a previous trial of the same case. The existence or absenceof a request for trial by military judge alone at a previous hearing shallhave no effect on the composition of a court-martial on rehearing. Accused's election.The accused at a rehearing or new or other trial shall have thesame right to request enlisted members or trial by military judge aloneas the accused would have at an original trial.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 902; 903.Examination of record of former proceedings.No member may, upon a rehearing or upon a new or other trial, examinethe record of any former proceedings in the same case except: When permitted to do so by the military judge after such mattershave been received in evidence; or That the president of a special court-martial without a militaryjudge may examine that part of the record of former proceedings which relatesto errors committed at the former proceedings when necessary to decide theadmissibility of offered evidence or other questions of law, and such a partof the record may be read to the members when necessary for them to considera matter subject to objection by any member. Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(2). 

 When arehearing is ordered, the trial counsel should be provided a record of theformer proceedings, accompanying documents, and any decision or review relatingto the case, as well as a statement of the reason for the rehearing.Sentence limitations.In general.Sentences at rehearings, new trials, or other trials shall be adjudgedwithin the limitations set forth in R.C.M. 1003. Except as otherwise providedin subsection (d)(2) of this rule, offenses on which a rehearing, new trial,or other trial has been ordered shall not be the basis for an approved sentencein excess of or more severe than the sentence ultimately approved by theconvening or higher authority following the previous trial or hearing, unlessthe sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. When a rehearing orsentencing is combined with trial on new charges, the maximum punishment thatmay be approved by the convening authority shall be the maximum punishmentunder R.C.M. 1003 for the offenses being reheard as limited above, plus thetotal maximum punishment under R.C.M. 1003 for any new charges of which theaccused has been found guilty. In the case of an "other trial"no sentence limitations apply if the original trial was invalid because asummary or special court-martial improperly tried an offense involving a mandatorypunishment or one otherwise considered capital.DiscussionAt a rehearing, the trier of fact is not bound by the sentence previously adjudged or approved. The members should not be advised of the sentence limitation under this rule. See R.C.M. 1005(e)(1). An appropriate sentence on a retried or reheard offense should be adjudged without regard to any credit to which the accused may be entitled. See R.C.M. 103(2) and R.C.M. 103(3) as to when a rehearing may be a capital case.Pretrial agreement.If, after the earlier court-martial, the sentence was approved inaccordance with a pretrial agreement and at the rehearing the accused failsto comply with the pretrial agreement, by failing to enter a plea of guiltyor otherwise, the approved sentence resulting at a rehearing of the affectedcharges and specifications may include any otherwise lawful punishment notin excess of or more serious than lawfully adjudged at the earlier court-martial.Definition."Other trial" means another trial of a case in whichthe original proceedings were declared invalid because of lack of jurisdictionor failure of a charge to state an offense. StipulationsIn general.The parties may make an oral or written stipulation to any fact,the contents of a document, or the expected testimony of a witness. Authority to reject.The military judge may, in the interest of justice, decline to accept a stipulation.DiscussionAlthough the decision to stipulate should ordinarily be left tothe parties, the military judge should not accept a stipulation if thereis any doubt of the accused's or any other party's understanding of thenature and effect of the stipulation. The military judge should also refuseto accept a stipulation which is unclear or ambiguous. A stipulation of factwhich amounts to a complete defense to any offense charged should not beaccepted nor, if a plea of not guilty is outstanding, should one which practicallyamounts to a confession, except as described in the discussion under subsection(c) of this rule. If a stipulation is rejected, the parties may be entitledto a continuance.Requirements.Before accepting a stipulation in evidence, the military judge mustbe satisfied that the parties consent to its admission.DiscussionOrdinarily, before accepting any stipulation the military judgeshould inquire to ensure that the accused understands the right not to stipulate,understands the stipulation, and consents to it. 

 If thestipulation practically amounts to a confession to an offense to which a notguilty plea is outstanding, it may not be accepted unless the military judgeascertains: (A) from the accused that the accused understands the right notto stipulate and that the stipulation will not be accepted without the accused'sconsent; that the accused understands the contents and effect of the stipulation;that a factual basis exists for the stipulation; and that the accused, afterconsulting with counsel, consents to the stipulation; and (B) from the accusedand counsel for each party whether there are any agreements between the partiesin connection with the stipulation, and, if so, what the terms of such agreementsare. 

 A stipulation practically amounts to a confession whenit is the equivalent of a guilty plea, that is, when it establishes, directlyor by reasonable inference, every element of a charged offense and when thedefense does not present evidence to contest any potential remaining issueof the merits. Thus, a stipulation which tends to establish, by reasonableinference, every element of a charged offense does not practically amountto a confession if the defense contests an issue going to guilt which is notforeclosed by the stipulation. For example, a stipulation of fact that contrabanddrugs were discovered in a vehicle owned by the accused would normally practicallyamount to a confession if no other evidence were presented on the issue,but would not if the defense presented evidence to show that the accused wasunaware of the presence of the drugs. Whenever a stipulation establishesthe elements of a charged offense, the military judge should conduct an inquiryas described above. 

 If, during an inquiry into a confessionalstipulation the military judge discovers that there is a pretrial agreement,the military judge must conduct an inquiry into the pretrial agreement. _See_ R.C.M. 910(f). _See also_ R.C.M. 705.Withdrawal.A party may withdraw from an agreement to stipulate or from a stipulationat any time before a stipulation is accepted; the stipulation may not thenbe accepted. After a stipulation has been accepted a party may withdrawfrom it only if permitted to do so in the discretion of the military judge.DiscussionIf a party withdraws from an agreement to stipulate or from a stipulation,before or after it has been accepted, the opposing party may be entitledto a continuance to obtain proof of the matters which were to have beenstipulated. 

 If a party is permitted to withdraw from a stipulation previously accepted, the stipulation must be disregarded by the court-martial,and an instruction to that effect should be given.Effect of stipulation.Unless properly withdrawn or ordered stricken from the record, a stipulation of fact that has been accepted is binding on the court-martialand may not be contradicted by the parties thereto. The contents of a stipulationof expected testimony or of a document's contents may be attacked, contradicted,or explained in the same way as if the witness had actually so testifiedor the document had been actually admitted. The fact that the parties sostipulated does not admit the truth of the indicated testimony or document'scontents, nor does it add anything to the evidentiary nature of the testimonyor document. The Military Rules of Evidence apply to the contents of stipulations.Procedure.When offered, a written stipulation shall be presented to the militaryjudge and shall be included in the record whether accepted or not. Once accepted,a written stipulation of expected testimony shall be read to the members,if any, but shall not be presented to them; a written stipulation of factor of a document's contents may be read to the members, if any, presentedto them, or both. Once accepted, an oral stipulation shall be announcedto the members, if any. Joint and common trialsIn joint trials and in common trials, each accused shall be accorded the rights and privileges as if tried separately.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)(5) concerning preparing chargesand specifications for joint trials. _See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(3)concerning referral of charges for joint or common trials, and the distinction between the two. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(9) concerning motionsto sever and other appropriate motions in joint or common trials. 

 Ina joint or common trial, each accused may be represented by separate counsel,make challenges for cause, make peremptory challenges (_see_ R.C.M.912), cross-examine witnesses, elect whether to testify, introduce evidence,request that the membership of the court include enlisted persons, if anenlisted accused, and, if a military judge has been detailed, request trialby military judge alone. 

 Where different elections are made(and, when necessary, approved) as to court-martial composition a severanceis necessary. Thus, if one co-accused elects to be tried by a court-martialcomposed of officers, and a second requests that enlisted members be detailedto the court, and a third submits a request for trial by military judgealone, which request is approved, three separate trials must be conducted. 

 Ina joint or common trial, evidence which is admissible against only one orsome of the joint or several accused may be considered only against the accusedconcerned. For example, when a stipulation is accepted which was made byonly one or some of the accused, the stipulation does not apply to thoseaccused who did not join it. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 306.In such instances the members must be instructed that the stipulation orevidence may be considered only with respect to the accused with respectto whom it is accepted. Announcing personnel of the court-martial and accusedOpening sessions.When the court-martial is called to order for the first time ina case, the military judge shall ensure that the following is announced:The order, including any amendment, by which the court-martial is convened; The name, rank, and unit or address of the accused; The name and rank of the military judge, if one has been detailed;The names and ranks of the members, if any, who are present; The names and ranks of members who are absent, if presence of members is required; The names and ranks (if any) of counsel who are present; The names and ranks (if any) of counsel who are absent; and The name and rank (if any) of any detailed court reporter. Later proceedings.When the court-martial is called to order after a recess or adjournmentor after it has been closed for any reason, the military judge shall ensurethat the record reflects whether all parties and members who were presentat the time of the adjournment or recess, or at the time the court-martial closed, are present. Additions, replacement, and absences of personnel.Whenever there is a replacement of the military judge, any member,or counsel, either through the appearance of new personnel or personnelpreviously absent or through the absence of personnel previously present,the military judge shall ensure the record reflects the change and the reasonfor it. TRIAL PROCEDURES THROUGH FINDINGSOpening sessionCall to order.A court-martial is in session when the military judge so declares.DiscussionThe military judge should examine the charge sheet, convening order, and any amending orders before calling the initial session to order. 

 Article35 provides that in time of peace, no proceedings, including Article 39(a) sessions, may be conducted over the accused's objection until five days have elapsed from the service of charges on the accused in the case of a generalcourt-martial. The period is three days for a special court-martial. Incomputing these periods, the date of service and the date of the proceedings are excluded. Holidays and Sundays are not excluded. Failure to object waives the right to the waiting period, but if it appears that the waiting periodhas not elapsed, the military judge should bring this to the attention ofthe defense and secure an affirmative waiver on the record.Announcement of parties.After the court-martial is called to order, the presence or absence of the parties, military judge, and members shall be announced.DiscussionIf the orders detailing the military judge and counsel have notbeen reduced to writing, an oral announcement of such detailing is required. _See_ R.C.M. 503(b) and (c).Swearing reporter and interpreter.After the personnel have been accounted for as required in subsection (b) of this rule, the trial counsel shall announce whether the reporterand interpreter, if any is present, have been properly sworn. If not sworn,the reporter and interpreter, if any, shall be sworn.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 807 concerning the oath to be administeredto a court reporter or interpreter. If a reporter or interpreter is replacedat any time during trial, this should be noted for the record, and the proceduresin this subsection should be repeated.Counsel.Trial counsel.The trial counsel shall announce the legal qualifications and status as to oaths of the members of the prosecution and whether any member ofthe prosecution has acted in any manner which might tend to disqualify thatcounsel. Defense counsel.The detailed defense counsel shall announce the legal qualifications and status as to oaths of the detailed members of the defense and whetherany member of the defense has acted in any manner which might tend to disqualifythat counsel. Any defense counsel not detailed shall state that counsel'slegal qualifications, and whether that counsel has acted in any manner whichmight tend to disqualify the counsel. Disqualification.If it appears that any counsel may be disqualified, the military judge shall decide the matter and take appropriate action.DiscussionCounsel may be disqualified because of lack of necessary qualifications,or because of duties or actions which are inconsistent with the role of counsel. _See_ R.C.M. 502(d) concerning qualifications of counsel. 

 Ifit appears that any counsel may be disqualified, the military judge shouldconduct an inquiry or hearing. If any detailed counsel is disqualified, the appropriate authority should be informed. If any defense counsel is disqualified,the accused should be so informed. 

 If the disqualificationof trial or defense counsel is one which the accused may waive, the accusedshould be so informed by the military judge, and given the opportunity todecide whether to waive the disqualification. In the case of defense counsel,if the disqualification is not waivable or if the accused elects not towaive the disqualification, the accused should be informed of the choicesavailable and given the opportunity to exercise such options. 

 Ifany counsel is disqualified, the military judge should ensure that the accusedis not prejudiced by any actions of the disqualified counsel or any breakin representation of the accused. 

 Disqualification of counselis not a jurisdictional defect; such error must be tested for prejudice. 

 Ifthe membership of the prosecution or defense changes at any time during theproceedings, the procedures in this subsection should be repeated as to thenew counsel. In addition, the military judge should ascertain on the recordwhether the accused objects to a change of defense counsel. _See_R.C.M. 505(d)(2) and 506(c).Inquiry. The military judge shall, in open session: Inform the accused of the rights to be represented by militarycounsel detailed to the defense; or by individual military counsel requestedby the accused, if such military counsel is reasonably available; and bycivilian counsel, either alone or in association with military counsel, ifsuch civilian counsel is provided at no expense to the United States; Inform the accused that, if afforded individual military counsel,the accused may request retention of detailed counsel as associate counsel,which request may be granted or denied in the sole discretion of the authoritywho detailed the counsel; Ascertain from the accused whether the accused understands these rights; Promptly inquire, whenever two or more accused in a joint or common trial are represented by the same detailed or individual military or civiliancounsel, or by civilian counsel who are associated in the practice of law,with respect to such joint representation and shall personally advise eachaccused of the right to effective assistance of counsel, including separaterepresentation. Unless it appears that there is good cause to believe noconflict of interest is likely to arise, the military judge shall take appropriate measures to protect each accused's right to counsel; andDiscussionWhenever it appears that any defense counsel may face a conflictof interest, the military judge should inquire into the matter, advise theaccused of the right to effective assistance of counsel, and ascertain theaccused's choice of counsel. When defense counsel is aware of a potentialconflict of interest, counsel should discuss the matter with the accused.If the accused elects to waive such conflict, counsel should inform themilitary judge of the matter at an Article 39(a) session so that an appropriaterecord can be made.Ascertain from the accused by whom the accused chooses to be represented.Unsworn counsel.The military judge shall administer the oath to any counsel not sworn.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 807.Presence of members.In cases in which a military judge has been detailed, the procedures described in R.C.M. 901 through 903, 904 when authorized by the Secretaryconcerned, and 905 through 910 shall be conducted without members presentin accordance with R.C.M. 803. Disqualification of military judgeIn general.Except as provided in subsection (e) of this rule, a military judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which that militaryjudge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Specific grounds.A military judge shall also disqualify himself or herself in the following circumstances: Where the military judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning theproceeding. Where the military judge has acted as counsel, preliminary hearing officer,legal officer, staff judge advocate, or convening authority as to any offensecharged or in the same case generally. Where the military judge has been or will be a witness in the samecase, is the accuser, has forwarded charges in the case with a personal recommendationas to disposition, or, except in the performance of duties as military judgein a previous trial of the same or a related case, has expressed an opinion concerning the guilt or innocence of the accused. Where the military judge is not eligible to act because the military judge is not qualified under R.C.M. 502(c) or not detailed under R.C.M.503(b). Where the military judge, the military judge's spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them or a spouse ofsuch person: Is a party to the proceeding; Is known by the military judge to have an interest, financial or otherwise, that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;or Is to the military judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.DiscussionA military judge should inform himself or herself about his or her financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself or herselfabout the financial interests of his or her spouse and minor children livingin his or her household.Definitions.For the purposes of this rule the following words or phrases shall have the meaning indicated- "Proceeding" includes pretrial, trial, post-trial,appellate review, or other stages of litigation. The "degree of relationship" is calculated accordingto the civil law system.DiscussionRelatives within the third degree of relationship are children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, parents, grandparents, great grandparents,brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces."Military judge" does not include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge. Procedure.The military judge shall, upon motion of any party or _sua sponte_, decide whether the military judge is disqualified.DiscussionThere is no peremptory challenge against a military judge. A military judge should carefully consider whether any of the grounds for disqualificationin this rule exist in each case. The military judge should broadly construegrounds for challenge but should not step down from a case unnecessarily. 

 Possiblegrounds for disqualification should be raised at the earliest reasonableopportunity. They may be raised at any time, and an earlier adverse rulingdoes not bar later consideration of the same issue, as, for example, whenadditional evidence is discovered.Each party shall be permitted to question the military judge andto present evidence regarding a possible ground for disqualification beforethe military judge decides the matter.DiscussionNothing in this rule prohibits the military judge from reasonably limiting the presentation of evidence, the scope of questioning, and argumenton the subject so as to ensure that only matters material to the centralissue of the military judge's possible disqualification are considered, thereby,preventing the proceedings from becoming a forum for unfounded opinion, speculationor innuendo.Except as provided under subsection (e) of this rule, if the military judge rules that the military judge is disqualified, the military judgeshall recuse himself or herself. Waiver.No military judge shall accept from the parties to the proceedinga waiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in subsection (b)of this rule. Where the ground for disqualification arises only under subsection(a) of this rule, waiver may be accepted provided it is preceded by a fulldisclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification. Accused's elections on composition of court-martialTime of elections.Request for enlisted members.Before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session or, in theabsence of such a session, before assembly, the military judge shall ascertain,as applicable, whether an enlisted accused elects to be tried by a court-martialincluding enlisted members. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion,permit the accused to defer requesting enlisted members until any time before assembly, which time may be determined by the military judge. Request for trial by military judge alone.Before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session, or, in the absence of such a session, before assembly, the military judge shall ascertain,as applicable, whether in a noncapital case, the accused requests trialby the military judge alone. The accused may defer requesting trial by militaryjudge alone until any time before assembly.DiscussionOnly an enlisted accused may request that enlisted members be detailedto a court-martial. Trial by military judge alone is not permitted in capitalcases (_see_ R.C.M. 201(f)(1)(C)) or in special courts-martialin which no military judge has been detailed.Form of election.Request for enlisted members.A request for the membership of the court-martial to include enlisted persons shall be in writing and signed by the accused or shall be made orallyon the record. Request for trial by military judge alone.A request for trial by military judge alone shall be in writingand signed by the accused or shall be made orally on the record. Action on election.Request for enlisted members.Upon notice of a timely request for enlisted members by an enlisted accused, the convening authority shall detail enlisted members to the court-martialin accordance with R.C.M. 503 or prepare a detailed written statement explainingwhy physical conditions or military exigencies prevented this. The trialof the general issue shall not proceed until this is done. Request for military judge alone.Upon receipt of a timely request for trial by military judge alone the military judge shall: Ascertain whether the accused has consulted with defense counseland has been informed of the identity of the military judge and of the rightto trial by members; andDiscussionOrdinarily the military judge should inquire personally of the accusedto ensure that the accused's waiver of the right to trial by members is knowingand understanding. Failure to do so is not error, however, where such knowledgeand understanding otherwise appear on the record. 

 DD Form1722 (Request for Trial Before Military Judge Alone (Art.16, UCMJ)) shouldnormally be used for the purpose of requesting trial by military judge aloneunder this rule, if a written request is used.Approve or disapprove the request, in the military judge's discretion.DiscussionA timely request for trial by military judge alone should be granted unless there is substantial reason why, in the interest of justice, themilitary judge should not sit as factfinder. The military judge may heararguments from counsel before acting on the request. The basis for denialof a request must be made a matter of record.Other.In the absence of a request for enlisted members or a request for trial by military judge alone, trial shall be by a court-martial composedof officers.DiscussionOrdinarily if no request for enlisted members or trial by military judge alone is submitted, the military judge should inquire whether sucha request will be made (_see_ subsection (a)(1) of this rule)unless these elections are not available to the accused.Right to withdraw request.Enlisted members.A request for enlisted members may be withdrawn by the accused asa matter of right any time before the end of the initial Article 39(a) session, or, in the absence of such a session, before assembly. Military judge.A request for trial by military judge alone may be withdrawn bythe accused as a matter of right any time before it is approved, or evenafter approval, if there is a change of the military judge.DiscussionWithdrawal of a request for enlisted members or trial by military judge alone should be shown in the record.Untimely requests.Failure to request, or failure to withdraw a request for enlistedmembers or trial by military judge alone in a timely manner shall waive theright to submit or to withdraw such a request. However, the military judgemay until the beginning of the introduction of evidence on the merits, asa matter of discretion, approve an untimely request or withdrawal of a request.DiscussionIn exercising discretion whether to approve an untimely requestor withdrawal of a request, the military judge should balance the reasonfor the request (for example, whether it is a mere change of tactics or resultsfrom a substantial change of circumstances) against any expense, delay, orinconvenience which would result from granting the request.Scope.For purposes of this rule, "military judge" does not include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.ArraignmentArraignment shall be conducted in a court-martial session and shall consist of reading the charges and specifications to the accused and callingon the accused to plead. The accused may waive the reading.DiscussionArraignment is complete when the accused is called upon to plead;the entry of pleas is not part of the arraignment. 

 Whenauthorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, the arraignment shouldbe conducted at an Article 39(a) session when a military judge has been detailed. The accused may not be arraigned at a conference under R.C.M. 802. 

 Oncethe accused has been arraigned, no additional charges against that accusedmay be referred to that court-martial for trial with the previously referredcharges. _ See_ R.C.M. 601(e)(2). 

 The defenseshould be asked whether it has any motions to make before pleas are entered.Some motions ordinarily must be made before a plea is entered. _ See_ R.C.M. 905(b).Motions generallyDefinitions and form.A motion is an application to the military judge for particular relief. Motions may be oral or, at the discretion of the military judge, written. A motion shall state the grounds upon which it is made and shallset forth the ruling or relief sought. The substance of a motion, not itsform or designation, shall control.DiscussionMotions may be motions to suppress --LSQP--(_see_ R.C.M. 905(b)(3))--RSQP--; motions for appropriate relief (_see_ R.C.M. 906); motions to dismiss (_see_ R.C.M. 907); or motions forfindings of not guilty (_see_ R.C.M. 917).Pretrial motions.Any defense, objection, or request which is capable of determination without the trial of the general issue of guilt may be raised before trial.The following must be raised before a plea is entered: Defenses or objections based on defects (other than jurisdictional defects) in the preferral, forwarding, investigation, or referral of charges;DiscussionSuch nonjurisdictional defects include unsworn charges, inadequate Article 32 preliminary hearing, and inadequate pretrial advice. _See_R.C.M. 307; 401-407; 601-604.Defenses or objections based on defects in the charges and specifications(other than any failure to show jurisdiction or to charge an offense, whichobjections shall be resolved by the military judge at any time during thependency of the proceedings);Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 307; 906(b)(3).Motions to suppress evidence;DiscussionMil. R. Evid. 304(d), 311(d), and 321(c) deal with the admissibility of confessions and admissions, evidence obtained from unlawful searchesand seizures, and eyewitness identification, respectively. Questions concerningthe admissibility of evidence on other grounds may be raised by objectionat trial or by motions _in limine_. _ See_ R.C.M.906(b)(13); Mil. R. Evid. 103(c); 104(a) and (c).Motions for discovery under R.C.M. 701 or for production of witnesses or evidence;Discussion _See_ also R.C.M. 703; 1001(e).Motions for severance of charges or accused; orDiscussion _See_ R.C.M. 812; 906(b)(9) and (10).Objections based on denial of request for individual military counselor for retention of detailed defense counsel when individual military counselhas been granted.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 506(b); 906(b)(2).Burden of proof.Standard.Unless otherwise provided in this Manual, the burden of proof onany factual issue the resolution of which is necessary to decide a motionshall be by a preponderance of the evidence.Discussion_See_ Mil. R. Evid. 104(a) concerning the applicabilityof the Military Rules of Evidence to certain preliminary questions.Assignment.Except as otherwise provided in this Manual the burden of persuasion on any factual issue the resolution of which is necessary to decide a motionshall be on the moving party.Discussion _See_, for example, subsection (c)(2)(B) of thisrule, R.C.M. 908 and Mil. R. Evid. 304(e), 311(e), and 321(d) for provisionsspecifically assigning the burden of proof.In the case of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, denial of the right to speedy trial under R.C.M. 707, or the running of the statuteof limitations, the burden of persuasion shall be upon the prosecution.Ruling on motions.A motion made before pleas are entered shall be determined before pleas are entered unless, if otherwise not prohibited by this Manual, themilitary judge for good cause orders that determination be deferred until trial of the general issue or after findings, but no such determination shall be deferred if a party's right to review or appeal is adversely affected.Where factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the militaryjudge shall state the essential findings on the record.DiscussionWhen trial cannot proceed further as the result of dismissal orother rulings on motions, the court-martial should adjourn and a record ofthe proceedings should be prepared for the convening authority. _See_ R.C.M. 908(b)(4) regarding automatic stay of certain rulings andorders subject to appeal under that rule. Notwithstanding the dismissal ofsome specifications, trial may proceed in the normal manner as long as one or more charges and specifications remain. The promulgating orders shouldreflect the action taken by the court-martial on each charge and specification,including any which were dismissed by the military judge on a motion. _See_ R.C.M. 1114.Effect of failure to raise defenses or objections.Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make motionsor requests which must be made before pleas are entered under subsection(b) of this rule shall constitute waiver. The military judge for good causeshown may grant relief from the waiver. Other motions, requests, defenses,or objections, except lack of jurisdiction or failure of a charge to allegean offense, must be raised before the court-martial is adjourned for thatcase and, unless otherwise provided in this Manual, failure to do so shallconstitute waiver. Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 910(j) concerning matters waivedby a plea of guilty.Reconsideration.On request of any party or _sua sponte_, the military judge may, prior to authentication of the record of trial, reconsider anyruling, other than one amounting to a finding of not guilty, made by themilitary judge.DiscussionSubsection (f) permits the military judge to reconsider any ruling that affects the legal sufficiency of any finding of guilt or the sentence. _See_ R.C.M. 917(d) for the standard to be used to determine thelegal sufficiency of evidence. _See also_ R.C.M. 1102 concerning procedures for post-trial reconsideration. Different standards may apply depending on the nature of the ruling. _See United States v. Scaff_, 29 M.J. 60 (C.M.A. 1989).Effect of final determinations.Any matter put in issue and finally determined by a court-martial, reviewing authority, or appellate court which had jurisdiction to determinethe matter may not be disputed by the United States in any other court-martialof the same accused, except that, when the offenses charged at one court-martialdid not arise out of the same transaction as those charged at the court-martialat which the determination was made, a determination of law and the applicationof law to the facts may be disputed by the United States. This rule alsoshall apply to matters which were put in issue and finally determined inany other judicial proceeding in which the accused and the United Statesor a Federal governmental unit were parties.Discussion _See_ also R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Whether a matterhas been finally determined in another judicial proceeding with jurisdictionto decide it, and whether such determination binds the United States inanother proceeding are interlocutory questions. _See_ R.C.M. 801(e). It does not matter whether the earlier proceeding ended in an acquittal,conviction, or otherwise, as long as the determination is final. Exceptfor a ruling which is, or amounts to, a finding of not guilty, a ruling ordinarilyis not final until action on the court-martial is completed. _See_ Article 76; R.C.M. 1209. The accused is not bound in a court-martialby rulings in another court-martial. _But see_ Article 3(b);R.C.M. 202. 

 The determination must have been made by a court-martial, reviewing authority, or appellate court, or by another judicial body, suchas a United States court. A pretrial determination by a convening authorityis not a final determination under this rule, although some decisions bya convening authority may bind the Government under other rules. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 601, 604, 704, 705. 

 TheUnited States is bound by a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction even if the earlier determination is erroneous, except when the offenses charged at the second proceeding arose out of a different transaction fromthose charged at the first and the ruling at the first proceeding was basedon an incorrect determination of law. 

 A final determinationin one case may be the basis for a motion to dismiss or a motion for appropriaterelief in another case, depending on the circumstances. The nature of theearlier determination and the grounds for it will determine its effect inother proceedings. 

 Examples:The military judge dismissed a charge for lack of personal jurisdiction, on grounds that the accused was only 16 years old at the time of enlistment and when the offenses occurred. At a second court-martial of the same accusedfor a different offense, the determination in the first case would requiredismissal of the new charge unless the prosecution could show that sincethat determination the accused had effected a valid enlistment or constructiveenlistment. _See_ R.C.M. 202. Note, however, that if theinitial ruling had been based on an error of law (for example, if the militaryjudge had ruled the enlistment invalid because the accused was 18 at thetime of enlistment) this would not require dismissal in the second court-martialfor a different offense.The accused was tried in United States district court for assaulton a Federal officer. The accused defended solely on the basis of alibiand was acquitted. The accused is then charged in a court-martial with assaulton a different person at the same time and place as the assault on a Federal officer was alleged to have occurred. The acquittal of the accused in Federal district court would bar conviction of the accused in the court-martial.In cases of this nature, the facts of the first trial must be examined todetermine whether the finding of the first trial is logically inconsistentwith guilt in the second case.At a court-martial for larceny, the military judge excluded evidenceof a statement made by the accused relating to the larceny and other unchargedoffenses because the statement was obtained by coercion. At a second court-martialfor an unrelated offense, the statement excluded at the first trial wouldbe inadmissible, based on the earlier ruling, if the first case had becomefinal. If the earlier ruling had been based on an incorrect interpretationof law, however, the issue of admissibility could be litigated anew at thesecond proceeding.At a court-martial for absence without authority, the charge andspecification were dismissed for failure to state an offense. At a latercourt-martial for the same offense, the earlier dismissal would be groundsfor dismissing the same charge and specification, but would not bar further proceedings on a new specification not containing the same defect as theoriginal specification.Written motions.Written motions may be submitted to the military judge after referraland when appropriate they may be supported by affidavits, with service andopportunity to reply to the opposing party. Such motions may be disposedof before arraignment and without a session. Upon request, either party isentitled to an Article 39(a) session to present oral argument or have anevidentiary hearing concerning the disposition of written motions. Service.Written motions shall be served on all other parties. Unless otherwisedirected by the military judge, the service shall be made upon counsel foreach party. Application to convening authority.Except as otherwise provided in this Manual, any matters which maybe resolved upon motion without trial of the general issue of guilt may besubmitted by a party to the convening authority before trial for decision.Submission of such matter to the convening authority is not, except as otherwiseprovided in this Manual, required, and is, in any event, without prejudiceto the renewal of the issue by timely motion before the military judge.Production of statements on motion to suppress.Except as provided in this subsection, R.C.M. 914 shall apply ata hearing on a motion to suppress evidence under subsection (b)(3) of thisrule. For purposes of this subsection, a law enforcement officer shall bedeemed a witness called by the Government, and upon a claim of privilege themilitary judge shall excise portions of the statement containing privilegedmatter. Motions for appropriate reliefIn general.A motion for appropriate relief is a request for a ruling to curea defect which deprives a party of a right or hinders a party from preparingfor trial or presenting its case. Grounds for appropriate relief.The following may be requested by motion for appropriate relief.This list is not exclusive. Continuances.A continuance may be granted only by the military judge.DiscussionThe military judge should, upon a showing of reasonable cause, granta continuance to any party for as long and as often as is just. Article 40.Whether a request for a continuance should be granted is a matter withinthe discretion of the military judge. Reasons for a continuance may include: insufficient opportunity to prepare for trial; unavailability of an essentialwitness; the interest of Government in the order of trial of related cases;and illness of an accused, counsel, military judge, or member. _Seealso_ R.C.M. 602; 803.Record of denial of individual military counsel or of denial of request to retain detailed counsel when a request for individual military counsel granted.If a request for military counsel was denied, whichdenial was upheld on appeal (if available) or if a request to retain detailedcounsel was denied when the accused is represented by individual militarycounsel, and if the accused so requests, the military judge shall ensurethat a record of the matter is included in the record of trial, and may makefindings. The trial counsel may request a continuance to inform the conveningauthority of those findings. The military judge may not dismiss the chargesor otherwise effectively prevent further proceedings based on this issue.However, the military judge may grant reasonable continuances until the requestedmilitary counsel can be made available if the unavailability results fromtemporary conditions or if the decision of unavailability is in the process of review in administrative channels. Correction of defects in the Article 32 preliminary hearing or pretrialadvice.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 405; 406. If the motion is granted,the military judge should ordinarily grant a continuance so the defect maybe corrected.Amendment of charges or specifications.A charge or specification may not be amended over the accused's objection unless the amendment is minor within the meaning of R.C.M. 603(a).Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 307. 

 An amendmentmay be appropriate when a specification is unclear, redundant, inartfullydrafted, misnames an accused, or is laid under the wrong article. A specificationmay be amended by striking surplusage, or substituting or adding new language.Surplusage may include irrelevant or redundant details or aggravating circumstanceswhich are not necessary to enhance the maximum authorized punishment or toexplain the essential facts of the offense. When a specification is amendedafter the accused has entered a plea to it, the accused should be asked toplead anew to the amended specification. A bill of particulars (_see_ subsection (b)(6) of this rule) may also be used when a specificationis indefinite or ambiguous. 

 If a specification, althoughstating an offense, is so defective that the accused appears to have beenmisled, the accused should be given a continuance upon request, or, in anappropriate case (_see_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3)), the specificationmay be dismissed.Severance of a duplicitous specification into two or more specifications.DiscussionEach specification may state only one offense. R.C.M. 307(c)(4). A duplicitous specification is one which alleges two or more separate offenses. Lesser included offenses (_see_ paragraph 3, Part IV) are not separate, nor is a continuing offense involving separate acts. The sole remedy for a duplicitous specification is severance of the specification into two or more specifications, each of which alleges a separate offense contained in the duplicitous specification. However, if the duplicitousness is combined with or results in other defects, such as misleading the accused, other remedies may be appropriate. See subsection (b)(3) of this rule. _See also_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3).Bill of particulars.A bill of particulars may be amended at any time, subject to suchconditions as justice permits.DiscussionThe purposes of a bill of particulars are to inform the accusedof the nature of the charge with sufficient precision to enable the accusedto prepare for trial, to avoid or minimize the danger of surprise at thetime of trial, and to enable the accused to plead the acquittal or convictionin bar of another prosecution for the same offense when the specificationitself is too vague and indefinite for such purposes. 

 Abill of particulars should not be used to conduct discovery of the Government'stheory of a case, to force detailed disclosure of acts underlying a charge,or to restrict the Government's proof at trial. 

 A billof particulars need not be sworn because it is not part of the specification.A bill of particulars cannot be used to repair a specification which is otherwisenot legally sufficient.Discovery and production of evidence and witnesses.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 701 concerning discovery. _See_ R.C.M. 703, 914 and 1001(e) concerning production of evidence andwitnesses.Relief from pretrial confinement. Upon a motion for release from pretrial confinement, a victim of an alleged offense committed by the accused has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the motion and any hearing, the right to confer with trial counsel, and the right to be reasonably heard. Inability to reasonably afford a victim these rights shall not delay the proceedings. The right to be heard under this rule includes the right to be heard through counsel.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 305(j).Severance of multiple accused, if it appears that an accused orthe Government is prejudiced by a joint or common trial. In a common trial,a severance shall be granted whenever any accused, other than the movingaccused, faces charges unrelated to those charged against the moving accused.Discussion A motion for severance is a request that one or more accused against whom charges have been referred to a joint or common trial be tried separately. Such a request should be granted if good cause is shown. For example, a severance may be appropriate when: the moving party wishes to use the testimony of one or more of the coaccused or the spouse of a coaccused; a defense of a coaccused is antagonistic to the moving party; or evidence as to any other accused will improperly prejudice the moving accused.

 If a severance is granted by the military judge, the military judge will decide which accused will be tried first. See R.C.M. 801(a)(1). In the case of joint charges, the military judge will direct an appropriate amendment of the charges and specifications.

 _See_ also R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3); 604; 812.Severance of offenses, but only to prevent manifest injustice.DiscussionOrdinarily, all known charges should be tried at a single court-martial.Joinder of minor and major offenses, or of unrelated offenses is not alonea sufficient ground to sever offenses. For example, when an essential witnessas to one offense is unavailable, it might be appropriate to sever that offenseto prevent violation of the accused's right to a speedy trial.Change of place of trial.The place of trial may be changed when necessary to prevent prejudiceto the rights of the accused or for the convenience of the Government ifthe rights of the accused are not prejudiced thereby.DiscussionA change of the place of trial may be necessary when there existsin the place where the court-martial is pending so great a prejudice againstthe accused that the accused cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there,or to obtain compulsory process over an essential witness. 

 Whenit is necessary to change the place of trial, the choice of places to whichthe court-martial will be transferred will be left to the convening authority,as long as the choice is not inconsistent with the ruling of the militaryjudge.Unreasonable multiplication of charges.The military judge may provide a remedy, as provided below, if he or she finds there has been an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentence.As applied to findings. Charges that arise from substantially the same transaction, while not legally multiplicious, may still be unreasonably multiplied as applied to findings. When the military judge finds, in his or her discretion, that the offenses have been unreasonably multiplied, the appropriate remedy shall be dismissal of the lesser offenses or merger of the offenses into one specification.As applied to sentence. Where the military judge finds that the nature of the harm requires a remedy that focuses more appropriately on punishment than on findings, he or she may find that there is an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence. If the military judge makes such a finding, the maximum punishment for those offenses determined to be unreasonably multiplied shall be the maximum authorized punishment of the offense carrying the greatest maximum punishment.DiscussionUnreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence is a limitation on the military's discretion to charge separate offenses and does not have a foundation in the Constitution. The concept is based on reasonableness and the prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. In contrast, multiplicity is grounded in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. It prevents an accused from being twice punished for one offense if it is contrary to the intent of Congress. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(3). Therefore, a motion for relief from unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence differs from a motion to dismiss on the grounds of multiplicity.

 The following non-exhaustive factors should be considered when determining whether two or more offenses are unreasonably multiplied: whether the specifications are aimed at distinctly separate criminal acts; whether they represent or exaggerate the accused's criminality; whether they unreasonably increase his or her exposure to punishment; and whether they suggest prosecutorial abuse of discretion in drafting of the specifications. Because prosecutors are permitted to plead in the alternative based on exigencies of proof, a ruling on this motion ordinarily should be deferred until after findings are entered.Preliminary ruling on admissibility of evidence.Discussion _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 104(c) 

 A requestfor a preliminary ruling on admissibility is a request that certain matters which are ordinarily decided during trial of the general issue be resolved before they arise, outside the presence of members. The purpose of sucha motion is to avoid the prejudice which may result from bringing inadmissible matters to the attention of court members. 

 Whether to ruleon an evidentiary question before it arises during trial is a matter withinthe discretion of the military judge. _But see_ R.C.M. 905(b)(3)and (d); and Mil. R. Evid. 304(e)(2); 311(e)(2); 321(d)(2). Reviewabilityof preliminary rulings will be controlled by the Supreme Court's decisionin_ Luce v. United States_, 469 U.S. 38 (1984).Motions relating to mental capacity or responsibility of the accused.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 706, 909, and 916(k) regarding proceduresand standards concerning the mental capacity or responsibility of the accused.Motions to dismissIn general.A motion to dismiss is a request to terminate further proceedingsas to one or more charges and specifications on grounds capable of resolutionwithout trial of the general issue of guilt.DiscussionDismissal of a specification terminates the proceeding with respect to that specification unless the decision to dismiss is reconsidered andreversed by the military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 905(f). Dismissalof a specification on grounds stated in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3)(A) belowdoes not ordinarily bar a later court-martial for the same offense if thegrounds for dismissal no longer exist. _See also_ R.C.M. 905(g)and subsection (b)(2) below. 

 _See_ R.C.M.916 concerning defenses.Grounds for dismissal.Grounds for dismissal include the following- Nonwaivable grounds.A charge or specification shall be dismissed at any stage of the proceedings if: The court-martial lacks jurisdiction to try the accused for the offense; orDiscussion _See_ R.C.M. 201-203.The specification fails to state an offense.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 307(c)Waivable grounds.A charge or specification shall be dismissed upon motion made bythe accused before the final adjournment of the court-martial in that caseif: Dismissal is required under R.C.M. 707; The statute of limitations (Article 43) has run, provided that,if it appears that the accused is unaware of the right to assert the statuteof limitations in bar of trial, the military judge shall inform the accusedof this right;DiscussionExcept for certain offenses for which there iseither:no limitation as to time;or child abuse offenses for which a time limitation has been enacted and applies that is based upon the life of a child abuse victim,_ see_ Article 43(a)and (b)(2), a person charged with an offenseunder the code may not be tried by court-martial over objection if sworn charges have not been received by the officer exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command within five years. _See_ Article43(b). This period may be tolled (Article 43(c) and (d)), extended (Article43(e) and (g)), or suspended (Article 43(f)) under certain circumstances.The prosecution bears the burden of proving that the statute of limitationshas been tolled, extended, or suspended if it appears that is has run. 

 Someoffenses are continuing offenses and any period of the offense occurringwithin the statute of limitations is not barred. Absence without leave, desertion,and fraudulent enlistment are not continuing offenses and are committed,respectively, on the day the person goes absent, deserts, or first receivespay or allowances under the enlistment. 

 When computing thestatute of limitations, periods in which the accused was fleeing from justice or periods when the accused was absent without leave or in desertion are excluded. The military judge must determine by a preponderance, as an interlocutorymatter, whether the accused was absent without authority or fleeing fromjustice. It would not be necessary that the accused be charged with the absenceoffense. In cases where the accused is charged with both an absence offenseand a non-absence offense, but is found not guilty of the absence offense,the military judge would reconsider, by a preponderance, his or her priordetermination whether that period of time is excludable. 

 Ifsworn charges have been received by an officer exercising summary court-martialjurisdiction over the command within the period of the statute, minor amendments(_see_ R.C.M. 603(a)) may be made in the specification afterthe statute of limitations has run. However, if new charges are drafted ora major amendment made (_see_ R.C.M. 603(d)) after the statuteof limitations has run, prosecution is barred. The date of receipt of sworncharges is excluded when computing the appropriate statutory period. Thedate of the offense is included in the computation of the elapsed time. Article43(g) allows the government time to reinstate charges dismissed as defectiveor insufficient for any cause. The government would have up to six monthsto reinstate the charges if the original period of limitations has expiredor will expire within six months of the dismissal. 

 In somecases, the issue whether the statute of limitations has run will depend onthe findings on the general issue of guilt. For example, where the date ofan offense is in dispute, a finding by the court-martial that the offenseoccurred at an earlier time may affect a determination as to the runningof the statute of limitations. 

 When the statute of limitationshas run as to a lesser included offense, but not as to the charged offense, _see_ R.C.M. 920(e)(2) with regard to instructions on the lesser offense.The accused has previously been tried by court-martial or federal civilian court for the same offense, provided that: No court-martial proceeding is a trial in the sense of this rule unless presentation of evidence on the general issue of guilt has begun;No court-martial proceeding which has been terminated under R.C.M. 604(b) or R.C.M. 915 shall bar later prosecution for the same offense oroffenses, if so provided in those rules; No court-martial proceeding in which an accused has been found guilty of any charge or specification is a trial in the sense of this rule untilthe finding of guilty has become final after review of the case has beenfully completed; and No court-martial proceeding which lacked jurisdiction to try the accused for the offense is a trial in the sense of this rule. Prosecution is barred by: A pardon issued by the President;DiscussionA pardon may grant individual or general amnesty.Immunity from prosecution granted by a person authorized to doso;Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 704.Constructive condonation of desertion established by unconditional restoration to duty without trial of a deserter by a general court-martialconvening authority who knew of the desertion; or Prior punishment under Articles 13 or 15 for the same offense, if that offense was minor.Discussion _See_ Articles 13 and 15(f). _See_ paragraph1e of Part V for a definition of "minor" offenses.Permissible grounds.A specification may be dismissed upon timely motion by the accused if one of the following is applicable: Defective.When the specification is so defective that it substantially misled the accused, and the military judge finds that, in the interest of justice, trial should proceed on any remaining charges and specifications without undue delay; or Multiplicity.When the specification is multiplicious with another specification, is unnecessary to enable the prosecution to meet the exigencies of proof through trial, review, and appellate action, and should be dismissed in the interest of justice. A charge is multiplicious if the proof of such charge also proves every element of another charge.Discussion Multiplicity is a legal concept, arising from the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense. Absent legislative intent to the contrary, an accused cannot be convicted and punished for violations of two or more statutes if those violations arise from a single act. Where Congress intended to impose multiple punishments for the same act, imposition of such sentence does not violate the Constitution.

 Multiplicity differs from unreasonable multiplication of charges. If two offenses are not multiplicious, they nonetheless may constitute an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentence. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Unreasonable multiplication of charges is a limitation on the military's discretion to charge separate offenses. It does not have a foundation in the Constitution; it is based on reasonableness and the prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. The military judge is to determine, in his or her discretion, whether the charges constitute unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentencing. _See_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12).

 To determine if two charges are multiplicious, the practitioner should first determine whether they are based on separate acts. If so, the charges are not multiplicious because separate acts may be charged and punished separately. If the charges are based upon a single act, the practitioner should next determine if Congress intended to impose multiple convictions and punishments for the same act. When there is no overt expression of congressional intent in the relevant statutes, such intent may be inferred based on the elements of the charged statutes and their relationship to each other or other principles of statutory interpretation. If each statute contains an element not contained in the other, it may be inferred that Congress intended they be charged and punished separately. Likewise, if each statute contains the same elements, it may be inferred that Congress did not intend they be charged and punished separately. A lesser included offense will always be multiplicious if charged separately, but offenses do not have to be lesser included to be multiplicious.

 Ordinarily, a specification should not be dismissed for multiplicity before trial. The less serious of any multiplicious specifications shall be dismissed after findings have been reached. Due consideration must be given, however, to possible post-trial or appellate action with regard to the remaining specification.Appeal by the United StatesIn general.In a trial by a court-martial over which a military judge presides and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States mayappeal an order or ruling that terminates the proceedings with respect toa charge or specification, or excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings, or directs the disclosure of classifiedinformation, or that imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information. The United States may also appeal a refusal by the military judge to issuea protective order sought by the United States to prevent the disclosureof classified information or to enforce such an order that has previouslybeen issued by the appropriate authority. However, the United States maynot appeal an order or ruling that is, or amounts to, a finding of not guiltywith respect to the charge or specification. Procedure.Delay.After an order or ruling which may be subject to an appeal by the United States, the court-martial may not proceed, except as to matters unaffectedby the ruling or order, if the trial counsel requests a delay to determinewhether to file notice of appeal under this rule. Trial counsel is entitledto no more than 72 hours under this subsection. Decision to appeal.The decision whether to file notice of appeal under this rule shall be made within 72 hours of the ruling or order to be appealed. If the Secretaryconcerned so prescribes, the trial counsel shall not file notice of appealunless authorized to do so by a person designated by the Secretary concerned.Notice of appeal.If the United States elects to appeal, the trial counsel shallprovide the military judge with written notice to this effect not later than72 hours after the ruling or order. Such notice shall identify the rulingor order to be appealed and the charges and specifications affected. Trialcounsel shall certify that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delayand (if the order or ruling appealed is one which excludes evidence) thatthe evidence excluded is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.Effect on the court-martial.Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)of this rule, the ruling or order that is the subject of the appeal is automaticallystayed and no session of the court-martial may proceed pending dispositionby the Court of Criminal Appeals of the appeal, except that solely as tocharges and specifications not affected by the ruling or order: Motions may be litigated, in the discretion of the military judge,at any point in the proceedings; When trial on the merits has not begun, a severance may be granted upon request of all the parties; a severance may be granted upon request of the accused and when appropriate under R.C.M. 906(b)(10); or When trial on the merits has begun but has not been completed, a party may, on that party's request and in the discretion of the militaryjudge, present further evidence on the merits. Record.Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)of this rule, trial counsel shall cause a record of the proceedings to beprepared. Such record shall be verbatim and complete to the extent necessaryto resolve the issues appealed. R.C.M. 1103(g), (h), and (i) shall applyand the record shall be authenticated in accordance with R.C.M. 1104(a).The military judge or the Court of Criminal Appeals may direct that additionalparts of the proceeding be included in the record; R.C.M. 1104(d) shall notapply to such additions. Forwarding.Upon written notice to the military judge under subsection (b)(3)of this rule, trial counsel shall promptly and by expeditious means forwardthe appeal to a representative of the Government designated by the JudgeAdvocate General. The matter forwarded shall include: a statement of theissues appealed; the record of the proceedings or, if preparation of therecord has not been completed, a summary of the evidence; and such othermatters as the Secretary concerned may prescribe. The person designated bythe Judge Advocate General shall promptly decide whether to file the appealwith the Court of Criminal Appeals and notify the trial counsel of thatdecision. Appeal filed.If the United States elects to file an appeal, it shall be filed directly with the Court of Criminal Appeals, in accordance with the rulesof that court. Appeal not filed.If the United States elects not to file an appeal, trial counsel promptly shall notify the military judge and the other parties. Pretrial confinement of accused pending appeal.If an accused is in pretrial confinement at the time the United States files notice of its intent to appeal under subsection (3) above,the commander, in determining whether the accused should be confined pending the outcome of an appeal by the United States, should consider the samefactors which would authorize the imposition of pretrial confinement underR.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B). Appellate proceedings.Appellate counsel.The parties shall be represented before appellate courts in proceedingsunder this rule as provided in R.C.M. 1202. Appellate Government counselshall diligently prosecute an appeal under this rule. Court of Criminal Appeals.An appeal under Article 62 shall, whenever practicable, have priority over all other proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeals. In determiningan appeal under Article 62, the Court of Criminal Appeals may take actiononly with respect to matters of law. Action following decision of Court of Criminal Appeals.After the Court of Criminal Appeals has decided any appeal under Article 62, the accused may petition for review by the Court of Appealsfor the Armed Forces, or the Judge Advocate General may certify a question to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The parties shall be notifiedof the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals promptly. If the decisionis adverse to the accused, the accused shall be notified of the decision and of the right to petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review within 60 days orally on the record at the court-martial or in accordancewith R.C.M. 1203(d). If the accused is notified orally on the record, trialcounsel shall forward by expeditious means a certificate that the accusedwas so notified to the Judge Advocate General, who shall forward a copy tothe clerk of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces when required bythe Court. If the decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals permits it, thecourt-martial may proceed as to the affected charges and specifications pendingfurther review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces or the SupremeCourt, unless either court orders the proceedings stayed. Unless the case is reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, it shall be returned to the military judge or the convening authority for appropriate actionin accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals. If the case is reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, R.C.M. 1204and 1205 shall apply. Military judge.For purposes of this rule, "military judge" does not include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.Capacity of the accused to stand trial by court-martialIn general.No person may be brought to trial by court-martial if that personis presently suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him orher mentally incompetent to the extent that he or she is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against them or to conduct or cooperate intelligentlyin the defense of the case. Discussion _See also_ R.C.M. 916(k).Presumption of capacity.A person is presumed to have the capacity to stand trial unlessthe contrary is established. Determination before referral.If an inquiry pursuant to R.C.M. 706 conducted before referralconcludes that an accused is suffering from a mental disease or defect thatrenders him or her mentally incompetent to stand trial, the convening authoritybefore whom the charges are pending for disposition may disagree with theconclusion and take any action authorized under R.C.M. 401, including referralof the charges to trial. If that convening authority concurs with the conclusion,he or she shall forward the charges to the general court-martial convening authority. If, upon receipt of the charges, the general court-martial conveningauthority similarly concurs, then he or she shall commit the accused to thecustody of the Attorney General. If the general court-martial conveningauthority does not concur, that authority may take any action that he orshe deems appropriate in accordance with R.C.M. 407, including referral ofthe charges to trial. Determination after referral.After referral, the military judge may conduct a hearing to determine the mental capacity of the accused, either _sua sponte_ orupon request of either party. If an inquiry pursuant to R.C.M. 706 conducted before or after referral concludes that an accused is suffering from a mental disease or defect that renders him or her mentally incompetent to standtrial, the military judge shall conduct a hearing to determine the mentalcapacity of the accused. Any such hearing shall be conducted in accordancewith paragraph (e) of this rule. Incompetence determination hearing.Nature of issue.The mental capacity of the accused is an interlocutory questionof fact. Standard.Trial may proceed unless it is established by a preponderance ofthe evidence that the accused is presently suffering from a mental diseaseor defect rendering him or her mentally incompetent to the extent that heor she is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings or to conductor cooperate intelligently in the defense of the case. In making this determination,the military judge is not bound by the rules of evidence except with respectto privileges. If the military judge finds the accused is incompetent to stand trial, the judge shall report this finding to the general court-martialconvening authority, who shall commit the accused to the custody of theAttorney GeneralHospitalization of the accused.An accused who is found incompetent to stand trial under this rule shall be hospitalized by the Attorney General as provided in section 4241(d)of title 18, United States Code. If notified that the accused has recoveredto such an extent that he or she is able to understand the nature of theproceedings and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of thecase, then the general court-martial convening authority shall promptlytake custody of the accused. If, at the end of the period of hospitalization,the accused's mental condition has not so improved, action shall be takenin accordance with section 4246 of title 18, United States Code.DiscussionUnder section 4241(d) of title 18, the initial period of hospitalizationfor an incompetent accused shall not exceed four months. However, in determiningwhether there is a substantial probability the accused will attain the capacityto permit the trial to proceed in the foreseeable future, the accused maybe hospitalized for an additional reasonable period of time. This additionalperiod of time ends either when the accused's mental condition is improvedso that trial may proceed, or when the pending charges against the accusedare dismissed. If charges are dismissed solely due to the accused's mentalcondition, the accused is subject to hospitalization as provided in section4246 of title 18.Excludable delay.All periods of commitment shall be excluded as provided by R.C.M. 707(c). The 120-day time period under R.C.M. 707 shall begin anew on thedate the general court-martial convening authority takes custody of theaccused at the end of any period of commitment. PleasAlternatives.In general.An accused may plead as follows: guilty; not guilty to an offenseas charged, but guilty of a named lesser included offense; guilty with exceptions,with or without substitutions, not guilty of the exceptions, but guiltyof the substitutions, if any; or, not guilty. A plea of guilty may not bereceived as to an offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged bythe court-martial.Discussion _See_ paragraph 3, Part IV, concerning lesser included offenses. When the plea is to a lesser included offense without the use of exceptions and substitutions, the defense counsel should provide a written revised specification to be included in the record as an appellate exhibit.

 A plea of guilty to a lesser included offense does not bar the prosecution from proceeding on the offense as charged. _See also_ subsection (g) of this rule.

 A plea of guilty does not prevent the introduction of evidence, either in support of the factual basis for the plea, or, after findings are entered, in aggravation. _See_ R.C.M. 1001(b)(4).Conditional pleas.With the approval of the military judge and the consent of theGovernment, an accused may enter a conditional plea of guilty, reservingthe right, on further review or appeal, to review of the adverse determinationof any specified pretrial motion. If the accused prevails on further reviewor appeal, the accused shall be allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty. TheSecretary concerned may prescribe who may consent for Government; unlessotherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the trial counsel may consent on behalf of the Government. Refusal to plead; irregular plea.If an accused fails or refuses to plead, or makes an irregular plea, the military judge shall enter a plea of not guilty for the accused.DiscussionAn irregular plea includes pleas such as guilty without criminality or guilty to a charge but not guilty to all specifications thereunder. Whena plea is ambiguous, the military judge should have it clarified beforeproceeding further.Advice to accused.Before accepting a plea of guilty, the military judge shall address the accused personally and inform the accused of, and determine that theaccused understands, the following: The nature of the offense to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty, if any, provided by law, and the maximum possible penaltyprovided by law;DiscussionThe elements of each offense to which the accused has pleaded guilty should be described to the accused. _See also_ subsection(e) of this rule.In a general or special court-martial, if the accused is not representedby counsel, that the accused has the right to be represented by counsel atevery stage of the proceedings;DiscussionIn a general or special court-martial, if the accused is not representedby counsel, a plea of guilty should not be accepted.That the accused has the right to plead not guilty or to persistin that plea if already made, and that the accused has the right to be triedby a court-martial, and that at such trial the accused has the right toconfront and cross-examine witnesses against the accused, and the right againstself-incrimination; That if the accused pleads guilty, there will not be a trial ofany kind as to those offenses to which the accused has so pleaded, so thatby pleading guilty the accused waives the rights described in subsection(c)(3) of this Rule; and That if the accused pleads guilty, the military judge will question the accused about the offenses to which the accused has pleaded guilty,and, if the accused answers these questions under oath, on the record, andin the presence of counsel, the accused's answers may later be used againstthe accused in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.DiscussionThe advice in subsection (5) is inapplicable in a court-martialin which the accused is not represented by counsel.Ensuring that the plea is voluntary.The military judge shall not accept a plea of guilty without first, by addressing the accused personally, determining that the plea is voluntaryand not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a pleaagreement under R.C.M. 705. The military judge shall also inquire whetherthe accused's willingness to plead guilty results from prior discussionsbetween the convening authority, a representative of the convening authority,or trial counsel, and the accused or defense counsel. Determining accuracy of plea.The military judge shall not accept a plea of guilty without making such inquiry of the accused as shall satisfy the military judge that thereis a factual basis for the plea. The accused shall be questioned under oathabout the offenses.DiscussionA plea of guilty must be in accord with the truth. Before the pleais accepted, the accused must admit every element of the offense(s) to whichthe accused pleaded guilty. Ordinarily, the elements should be explainedto the accused. If any potential defense is raised by the accused's accountof the offense or by other matter presented to the military judge, the militaryjudge should explain such a defense to the accused and should not acceptthe plea unless the accused admits facts which negate the defense. If the statute of limitations would otherwise bar trial for the offense, the military judge should not accept a plea of guilty to it without an affirmative waiverby the accused. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B). 

 Theaccused need not describe from personal recollection all the circumstancesnecessary to establish a factual basis for the plea. Nevertheless the accusedmust be convinced of, and able to describe all the facts necessary to establishguilt. For example, an accused may be unable to recall certain events in an offense, but may still be able to adequately describe the offense basedon witness statements or similar sources which the accused believes to betrue. 

 The accused should remain at the counsel table during questioning by the military judge.Plea agreement inquiry.In general.A plea agreement may not be accepted if it does not comply with R.C.M. 705. Notice.The parties shall inform the military judge if a plea agreement exists.DiscussionThe military judge should ask whether a plea agreement exists. _See_ subsection (d) of this rule. Even if the military judge failsto so inquire or the accused answers incorrectly, counsel have an obligationto bring any agreements or understandings in connection with the plea tothe attention of the military judge.Disclosure.If a plea agreement exists, the military judge shall require disclosureof the entire agreement before the plea is accepted, provided that in trialbefore military judge alone the military judge ordinarily shall not examineany sentence limitation contained in the agreement until after the sentenceof the court-martial has been announced. Inquiry.The military judge shall inquire to ensure: That the accused understands the agreement; and That the parties agree to the terms of the agreement.DiscussionIf the plea agreement contains any unclear or ambiguous terms, the military judge should obtain clarification from the parties. If there isdoubt about the accused's understanding of any terms in the agreement, themilitary judge should explain those terms to the accused.Findings.Findings based on a plea of guilty may be entered immediately upon acceptance of the plea at an Article 39(a) session unless: Such action is not permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned;The plea is to a lesser included offense and the prosecution intends to proceed to trial on the offense as charged; or Trial is by a special court-martial without a military judge, in which case the president of the court-martial may enter findings based onthe pleas without a formal vote except when subsection (g)(2) of this ruleapplies.DiscussionIf the accused has pleaded guilty to some offenses but not to others, the military judge should ordinarily defer informing the members of theoffenses to which the accused has pleaded guilty until after findings onthe remaining offenses have been entered. _ See_ R.C.M. 913(a),Discussion and R.C.M. 920(e), Discussion, paragraph 3.Later action.Withdrawal by the accused.If after acceptance of the plea but before the sentence is announced the accused requests to withdraw a plea of guilty and substitute a pleaof not guilty or a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense, the militaryjudge may as a matter of discretion permit the accused to do so. Statements by accused inconsistent with plea.If after findings but before the sentence is announced the accused makes a statement to the court-martial, in testimony or otherwise, or presentsevidence which is inconsistent with a plea of guilty on which a findingis based, the military judge shall inquire into the providence of the plea. If, following such inquiry, it appears that the accused entered the pleaimprovidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effecta plea of not guilty shall be entered as to the affected charges and specifications.DiscussionWhen the accused withdraws a previously accepted plea for guiltyor a plea of guilty is set aside, counsel should be given a reasonable timeto prepare to proceed. In a trial by military judge alone, recusal of themilitary judge or disapproval of the request for trial by military judgealone will ordinarily be necessary when a plea is rejected or withdrawn afterfindings; in trial with members, a mistrial will ordinarily be necessary.Pretrial agreement inquiry.After sentence is announced the military judge shall inquire intoany parts of a pretrial agreement which were not previously examined bythe military judge. If the military judge determines that the accused doesnot understand the material terms of the agreement, or that the parties disagreeas to such terms, the military judge shall conform, with the consent of theGovernment, the agreement to the accused's understanding or permit the accusedto withdraw the plea.Discussion _See_ subsection (f)(3) of this rule.Record of proceedings.A verbatim record of the guilty plea proceedings shall be made in cases in which a verbatim record is required under R.C.M. 1103. In otherspecial courts-martial, a summary of the explanation and replies shall beincluded in the record of trial. As to summary courts-martial, _see_ R.C.M. 1305. Waiver.Except as provided in subsection (a)(2) of this rule, a plea of guilty which results in a finding of guilty waives any objection, whetheror not previously raised, insofar as the objection relates to the factual issue of guilt of the offense(s) to which the plea was made. Assembly of the court-martialThe military judge shall announce the assembly of the court-martial.DiscussionWhen trial is by a court-martial with members, the court-martialis ordinarily assembled immediately after the members are sworn. The membersare ordinarily sworn at the first session at which they appear, as soonas all parties and personnel have been announced. The members are seatedwith the president, who is the senior member, in the center, and the othermembers alternately to the president's right and left according to rank.If the rank of a member is changed, or if the membership of the court-martialchanges, the members should be reseated accordingly. 

 Whentrial is by military judge alone, the court-martial is ordinarily assembledimmediately following approval of the request for trial by military judgealone. 

 Assembly of the court-martial is significant becauseit marks the point after which: substitution of the members and militaryjudge may no longer take place without good cause (_see_ Article29; R.C.M. 505; 902; 912); the accused may no longer, as a matter of right, request trial by military judge alone or withdraw such a request previouslyapproved (_see_ Article 16; R.C.M. 903(a)(2)(d)); and the accused may no longer request, even with the permission of the military judge, or withdraw from a request for, enlisted members (_see_ Article25(c)(1); R.C.M. 903(a)(1)(d)).Challenge of selection of members; examination and challenges of membersPretrial matters.Questionnaires.Before trial the trial counsel may, and shall upon request of the defense counsel, submit to each member written questions requesting thefollowing information: Date of birth; Sex; Race; Marital status and sex, age, and number of dependents; Home of record; Civilian and military education, including, when available, major areas of study, name of school or institution, years of education, and degreesreceived; Current unit to which assigned; Past duty assignments; Awards and decorations received; Date of rank; and Whether the member has acted as accuser, counsel, preliminary hearing officer, convening authority, or legal officer or staff judge advocate forthe convening authority in the case, or has forwarded the charges with a recommendation as to disposition. 

 Additional information maybe requested with the approval of the military judge. Each member's responsesto the questions shall be written and signed by the member.DiscussionUsing questionnaires before trial may expedite voir dire and may permit more informed exercise of challenges. 

 If the questionnaireis marked or admitted as an exhibit at the court-martial it must be attachedto or included in the record of trial. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(D)(iv)and (b)(3)(B). Other materials.A copy of any written materials considered by the convening authority in selecting the members detailed to the court-martial shall be providedto any party upon request, except that such materials pertaining solelyto persons who were not selected for detail as members need not be providedunless the military judge, for good cause, so directs. Challenge of selection of members.Motion.Before the examination of members under subsection (d) of this rule begins, or at the next session after a party discovered or could have discoveredby the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier,that party may move to stay the proceedings on the ground that members wereselected improperly. Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 502(a) and 503(a) concerning selectionof members. Members are also improperly selected when, for example, a certaingroup or class is arbitrarily excluded from consideration as members.Procedure.Upon a motion under subsection (b)(1) of this rule containing an offer of proof of matters which, if true, would constitute improper selectionof members, the moving party shall be entitled to present evidence, includingany written materials considered by the convening authority in selectingthe members. Any other party may also present evidence on the matter. Ifthe military judge determines that the members have been selected improperly,the military judge shall stay any proceedings requiring the presence of membersuntil members are properly selected. Waiver.Failure to make a timely motion under this subsection shall waivethe improper selection unless it constitutes a violation of R.C.M. 501(a),502(a)(1), or 503(a)(2). Stating grounds for challenge.The trial counsel shall state any ground for challenge for cause against any member of which the trial counsel is aware. Examination of members.The military judge may permit the parties to conduct the examination of members or may personally conduct the examination. In the latter eventthe military judge shall permit the parties to supplement the examination by such further inquiry as the military judge deems proper or the military judge shall submit to the members such additional questions by the partiesas the military judge deems proper. A member may be questioned outside thepresence of other members when the military judge so directs.DiscussionExamination of the members is called "voir dire." Ifthe members have not already been placed under oath for the purpose of voirdire (_see_ R.C.M. 807(b)(2) Discussion (B)), they should be sworn before they are questioned. 

 The opportunity forvoir dire should be used to obtain information for the intelligent exercise of challenges; counsel should not purposely use voir dire to present factual matter which will not be admissible or to argue the case. 

 Thenature and scope of the examination of members is within the discretion ofthe military judge. Members may be questioned individually or collectively.Ordinarily, the military judge should permit counsel to personally questionthe members. Trial counsel ordinarily conducts an inquiry before the defense.Whether trial counsel will question all the members before the defense beginsor whether some other procedure will be followed depends on the circumstances.For example, when members are questioned individually outside the presenceof other members, each party would ordinarily complete questioning that member before another member is questioned. The military judge and each party mayconduct additional questioning, after initial questioning by a party, asnecessary. 

 Ordinarily the members should be asked whetherthey are aware of any ground for challenge against them. This may expeditefurther questioning. The members should be cautioned, however, not to disclose information in the presence of other members which might disqualify them.Evidence.Any party may present evidence relating to whether grounds forchallenge exist against a member. Challenges and removal for cause.Grounds.A member shall be excused for cause whenever it appears that the member: Is not competent to serve as a member under Article 25(a), (b),or (c); Has not been properly detailed as a member of the court-martial;Is an accuser as to any offense charged; Will be a witness in the court-martial; Has acted as counsel for any party as to any offense charged; Has been an a preliminary hearing officer as to any offense charged; Has acted in the same case as convening authority or as the legal officer or staff judge advocate to the convening authority; Will act in the same case as reviewing authority or as the legal officer or staff judge advocate to the reviewing authority; Has forwarded charges in the case with a personal recommendationas to disposition; Upon a rehearing or new or other trial of the case, was a memberof the court-martial which heard the case before; Is junior to the accused in grade or rank, unless it is established that this could not be avoided; Is in arrest or confinement; Has formed or expressed a definite opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused as to any offense charged; Should not sit as a member in the interest of having the court-martialfree from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality.DiscussionExamples of matters which may be grounds for challenge under subsection(N) are that the member: has a direct personal interest in the result ofthe trial; is closely related to the accused, a counsel, or a witness inthe case; has participated as a member or counsel in the trial of a closelyrelated case; has a decidedly friendly or hostile attitude toward a party;or has an inelastic opinion concerning an appropriate sentence for the offensescharged.When made.Upon completion of examination.Upon completion of any examination under subsection (d) of thisrule and the presentation of evidence, if any, on the matter, each partyshall state any challenges for cause it elects to make. Other times.A challenge for cause may be made at any other time during trialwhen it becomes apparent that a ground for challenge may exist. Such examinationof the member and presentation of evidence as may be necessary may be madein order to resolve the matter. Procedure.Each party shall be permitted to make challenges outside the presence of the members. The party making a challenge shall state the grounds forit. Ordinarily the trial counsel shall enter any challenges for cause beforethe defense counsel. The military judge shall rule finally on each challenge.When a challenge for cause is granted, the member concerned shall be excused.The burden of establishing that grounds for a challenge exist is upon theparty making the challenge. A member successfully challenged shall be excused.Waiver.The grounds for challenge in subsection (f)(1)(A) of this rule may not be waived except that membership of enlisted members in the same unitas the accused may be waived. Membership of enlisted members in the sameunit as the accused and any other ground for challenge is waived if the partyknew of or could have discovered by the exercise of diligence the groundfor challenge and failed to raise it in a timely manner. Notwithstanding the absence of a challenge or waiver of a challenge by the parties, themilitary judge may, in the interest of justice, excuse a member against whoma challenge for cause would lie. When a challenge for cause has been denied the successful use of a peremptory challenge by either party, excusing the challenged member from further participation in the court-martial, shall preclude further consideration of the challenge of that excused member upon later review. Further, failure by the challenging party to exercise a peremptory challenge againstany member shall constitute waiver of further consideration of the challengeupon later review. Discussion _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 606(b) when a member maybe a witness.Peremptory challenges.Procedure.Each party may challenge one member peremptorily. Any member so challenged shall be excused. No party may be required to exercise a peremptorychallenge before the examination of members and determination of any challengesfor cause has been completed. Ordinarily the trial counsel shall enter anyperemptory challenge before the defense.DiscussionGenerally, no reason is necessary for a peremptory challenge. _ But see Batson v. Kentucky_ 476 U.S. 79 (1986); _United Statesv. Curtis_, 33 M.J. 101 (C.M.A. 1991), _cert. denied_, 112 S.Ct. 1177 (1992); _United States v. Moore_, 28 M.J. 366 (C.M.A. 1989); _United States v. Santiago-Davilla_, 26 M.J.380 (C.M.A. 1988).Waiver.Failure to exercise a peremptory challenge when properly calledupon to do so shall waive the right to make such a challenge. The militaryjudge may, for good cause shown, grant relief from the waiver, but a peremptorychallenge may not be made after the presentation of evidence before the membershas begun. However, nothing in this subsection shall bar the exercise ofa previously unexercised peremptory challenge against a member newly detailedunder R.C.M. 505(c)(2)(B), even if presentation of evidence on the meritshas begun.DiscussionWhen the membership of the court-martial has been reduced belowa quorum (_see_ R.C.M. 501) or, when enlisted members havebeen requested, the fraction of enlisted members has been reduced belowone-third, the proceedings should be adjourned and the convening authoritynotified so that new members may be detailed. _See_ R.C.M.505. _See also_ R.C.M. 805(d) concerning other procedureswhen new members are detailed.Special courts-martial without a military judge.In a special court-martial without a military judge, the procedures in this rule shall apply, except that challenges shall be made in the presenceof the members and a ruling on any challenge for cause shall be decidedby a majority vote of the members upon secret written ballot in closed session.The challenged member shall not be present at the closed session at whichthe challenge is decided. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the memberchallenged. Before closing, the president shall give such instructions asmay be necessary to resolve the challenge. Each challenge shall be decided separately, and all unexcused members except the challenged member shallparticipate. When only three members are present and one is challenged,the remaining two may decide the challenge. When the president is challenged, the next senior member shall act as president for purposes of deciding thechallenge. Definitions.Military judge.For purpose of this rule, "military judge" does not include the president of a special court-martial without a military judge.Witness.For purposes of this rule, "witness" includes one who testifies at a court-martial and anyone whose declaration is received inevidence for any purpose, including written declarations made by affidavitor otherwise.DiscussionFor example, a person who by certificate has attested or otherwise authenticated an official record or other writing introduced in evidenceis a witness.Preliminary hearing officer.For purposes of this rule, "preliminary hearing officer" includes any person who has examined charges under R.C.M. 405 and any person who was counsel for a member of a court of inquiry, or otherwise personally has conducted an investigation of the general matter involving the offenses charged.Presentation of the case on the meritsPreliminary instructions.The military judge may give such preliminary instructions as maybe appropriate. If mixed pleas have been entered, the military judge shouldordinarily defer informing the members of the offenses to which the accusedpleaded guilty until after the findings on the remaining contested offenseshave been entered.DiscussionPreliminary instructions may include a description of the dutiesof members, procedures to be followed in the court-martial, and other appropriatematters. 

 Exceptions to the rule requiring the military judgeto defer informing the members of an accused's prior pleas of guilty includecases in which the accused has specifically requested, on the record, thatthe military judge instruct the members of the prior pleas of guilty andcases in which a plea of guilty was to a lesser included offense within thecontested offense charged in the specification. _See_ R.C.M.910(g), Discussion and R.C.M. 920(e), Discussion, paragraph 3.Opening statements.Each party may make one opening statement to the court-martial before presentation of evidence has begun. The defense may elect to make its statementafter the prosecution has rested, before the presentation of evidence forthe defense. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit theparties to address the court-martial at other times.DiscussionCounsel should confine their remarks to evidence they expect tobe offered which they believe in good faith will be available and admissibleand a brief statement of the issues in the case.Presentation of evidence.Each party shall have full opportunity to present evidence. Order of presentation. Ordinarily the following sequence shall be followed: Presentation of evidence for the prosecution; Presentation of evidence for the defense; Presentation of prosecution evidence in rebuttal; Presentation of defense evidence in surrebuttal; Additional rebuttal evidence in the discretion of the military judge; and Presentation of evidence requested by the military judge or members.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 801(a) and Mil. R. Evid. 611 concerningcontrol by the military judge over the order of proceedings.Taking testimony.The testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally in open session, unless otherwise provided in this Manual.DiscussionEach witness must testify under oath. _See_ R.C.M. 807(b)(1)(B); Mil. R. Evid. 603. After a witness is sworn, the witness shouldbe identified for the record (full name, rank, and unit, if military, orfull name and address, if civilian). The party calling the witness conductsdirect examination of the witness, followed by cross-examination of the witnessby the opposing party. Redirect and re-cross-examination are conducted asnecessary, followed by any questioning by the military judge and members. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 611; 614. 

 All documentaryand real evidence (except marks or wounds on a person's body) should bemarked for identification when first referred to in the proceedings and shouldbe included in the record of trial whether admitted in evidence or not. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(C), (c). "Real evidence" includephysical objects, such as clothing, weapons, and marks or wounds on a person'sbody. If it is impracticable to attach an item of real evidence to the record,the item should be clearly and accurately described by testimony, photographs,or other means so that it may be considered on review. Similarly, when documentaryevidence is used, if the document cannot be attached to the record (as in the case of an original official record or a large map), a legible copy or accurate extract should be included in the record. When a witness pointsto or otherwise refers to certain parts of a map, photograph, diagram, chart, or other exhibit, the place to which the witness pointed or referred shouldbe clearly identified for the record, either by marking the exhibit or byan accurate description of the witness' actions with regard to the exhibit.Views and inspections.The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit the court-martialto view or inspect premises or a place or an article or object. Such a viewor inspection shall take place only in the presence of all parties, themembers (if any), and the military judge. A person familiar with the scenemay be designated by the military judge to escort the court-martial. Suchperson shall perform the duties of escort under oath. The escort shall nottestify, but may point out particular features prescribed by the militaryjudge. Any statement made at the view or inspection by the escort, a party,the military judge, or any member shall be made part of the record.DiscussionA view or inspection should be permitted only in extraordinarycircumstances. The fact that a view or inspection has been made does notnecessarily preclude the introduction in evidence of photographs, diagrams, maps, or sketches of the place or item viewed, if these are otherwise admissible.Evidence subject to exclusion.When offered evidence would be subject to exclusion upon objection, the military judge may, as a matter of discretion, bring the matter to theattention of the parties and may, in the interest of justice, exclude theevidence without an objection by a party.DiscussionThe military judge should not exclude evidence which is not objected to by a party except in extraordinary circumstances. Counsel should be permittedto try the case and present the evidence without unnecessary interference by the military judge. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 103.Reopening case.The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit a partyto reopen its case after it has rested. Production of statements of witnessesMotion for production.After a witness other than the accused has testified on directexamination, the military judge, on motion of a party who did not call thewitness, shall order the party who called the witness to produce, for examinationand use by the moving party, any statement of the witness that relates tothe subject matter concerning which the witness has testified, and that is:In the case of a witness called by the trial counsel, in the possessionof the United States; or In the case of a witness called by the defense, in the possessionof the accused or defense counsel.Discussion _See also_ R.C.M. 701 (Discovery). 

 Counselshould anticipate legitimate demands for statements under this and similarrules and avoid delays in the proceedings by voluntary disclosure before arraignment. 

 This rule does not apply to investigationsunder Article 32. 

 As to procedures for certain governmentinformation as to which a privilege is asserted, _see_ Mil.R. Evid. 505; 506.Production of entire statement.If the entire contents of the statement relate to the subject matter concerning which the witness has testified, the military judge shall orderthat the statement be delivered to the moving party. Production of excised statement.If the party who called the witness claims that the statement containsmatter that does not relate to the subject matter concerning which the witnesshas testified, the military judge shall order that it be delivered to themilitary judge. Upon inspection, the military judge shall excise the portionsof the statement that do not relate to the subject matter concerning whichthe witness has testified, and shall order that the statement, with suchmaterial excised, be delivered to the moving party. Any portion of a statementthat is withheld from an accused over objection shall be preserved by thetrial counsel, and, in the event of a conviction, shall be made availableto the reviewing authorities for the purpose of determining the correctnessof the decision to excise the portion of the statement. Recess for examination of the statement.Upon delivery of the statement to the moving party, the military judge may recess the trial for the examination of the statement and preparationfor its use in the trial. Remedy for failure to produce statement.If the other party elects not to comply with an order to delivera statement to the moving party, the military judge shall order that thetestimony of the witness be disregarded by the trier of fact and that thetrial proceed, or, if it is the trial counsel who elects not to comply, shalldeclare a mistrial if required in the interest of justice. Definition.As used in this rule, a "statement" of a witness means:A written statement made by the witness that is signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness; A substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by the witness that is recorded contemporaneously with the making of the oral statementand contained in a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recordingor a transcription thereof; or A statement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription thereof, made by the witness to a Federal grand jury. Use of remote live testimony of a childGeneral procedures.A child shall be allowed to testify out of the presence of theaccused after the military judge has determined that the requirements ofMil. R. Evid. 611(d)(3) have been satisfied. The procedure used to take such testimony will be determined by the military judge based upon the exigencies of the situation. At a minimum, the following proceduresshall be observed: The witness shall testify from a remote location outside the courtroom;Attendance at the remote location shall be limited to the child, counsel for each side (not including an accused pro se), equipment operators,and other persons, such as an attendant for the child, whose presence isdeemed necessary by the military judge; Sufficient monitors shall be placed in the courtroom to allow viewing and hearing of the testimony by the military judge, the accused, the members,the court reporter and the public; The voice of the military judge shall be transmitted into the remote location to allow control of the proceedings; and The accused shall be permitted private, contemporaneous communication with his counsel. Definition.As used in this rule, "remote live testimony" includes, but is not limited to, testimony by videoteleconference, closed circuit television, or similar technology.Prohibitions.The procedures described above shall not be used where the accused elects to absent himself from the courtroom pursuant to R.C.M. 804(c).DiscussionFor purposes of this rule, unlike R.C.M. 914B, remote means or similar technology does not include receiving testimony by telephone where the parties cannot see and hear each other.Use of remote testimonyGeneral procedures.The military judge shall determine the procedures used to take testimony via remote means. At a minimum, all parties shall be able to hear each other, those in attendance at the remote site shall be identified, and the accused shall be permitted private, contemporaneous communication with his counsel.Definition.As used in this rule, testimony via "remote means" includes, but is not limited to, testimony by videoteleconference, closed circuit television, telephone, or similar technology.DiscussionThis rule applies for all witness testimony other than child witness testimony specifically covered by Mil. R. Evid. 611(d) and R.C.M. 914A. When utilizing testimony via remote means, military justice practitioners are encouraged to consult the procedure used in _In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation_, 129 F.R.D. 424 (D.P.R. 1989) and to read _United States v. Gigante_, 166 F.3d 75 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1114 (2000).MistrialIn general.The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, declare a mistrial when such action is manifestly necessary in the interest of justice becauseof circumstances arising during the proceedings which cast substantial doubtupon the fairness of the proceedings. A mistrial may be declared as to someor all charges, and as to the entire proceedings or as to only the proceedingsafter findings.DiscussionThe power to grant a mistrial should be used with great caution, under urgent circumstances, and for plain and obvious reasons. As examples,a mistrial may be appropriate when inadmissible matters so prejudicial thata curative instruction would be inadequate are brought to the attention ofthe members or when members engage in prejudicial misconduct. Also a mistrialis appropriate when the proceedings must be terminated because of a legaldefect, such as a jurisdictional defect, which can be cured; for example,when the referral is jurisdictionally defective. _See also_ R.C.M. 905(g) concerning the effect of rulings in one proceeding on later proceedings.Procedure.On motion for a mistrial or when it otherwise appears that grounds for a mistrial may exist, the military judge shall inquire into the viewsof the parties on the matter and then decide the matter as an interlocutoryquestion.DiscussionExcept in a special court-martial without a military judge, the hearing on a mistrial should be conducted out of the presence of the members.Effect of declaration of mistrial.Withdrawal of charges.A declaration of a mistrial shall have the effect of withdrawingthe affected charges and specifications from the court-martial.DiscussionUpon declaration of a mistrial, the affected charges are returnedto the convening authority who may refer them anew or otherwise dispose ofthem. _See_ R.C.M. 401-407.Further proceedings.A declaration of a mistrial shall not prevent trial by anothercourt-martial on the affected charges and specifications except when themistrial was declared after jeopardy attached and before findings, and thedeclaration was: An abuse of discretion and without the consent of the defense; orThe direct result of intentional prosecutorial misconduct designedto necessitate a mistrial. DefensesIn general.As used in this rule, "defenses" includes any special defense which, although not denying that the accused committed the objective acts constituting the offense charged, denies, wholly or partially, criminalresponsibility for those acts.DiscussionSpecial defenses are also called "affirmative defenses." 

 "Alibi" and "good character" are not special defenses,as they operate to deny that the accused committed one or more of the acts constituting the offense. As to evidence of the accused's good character, _see_ Mil. R. Evid. 404(a)(1). _See_ R.C.M.701(b)(1) concerning notice of alibi.Burden of proof.General rule.Except as listed below in paragraphs (2) and (3), the prosecution shall have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense did not exist. Lack of mental responsibility.The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.Mistake of fact as to age.In the defense of mistake of fact as to age as described in Article 120b(d)(2) in a prosecution of a child sexual offense, the accused has the burden of proving mistake of fact as to age by a preponderance of the evidence.DiscussionA defense may be raised by evidence presented by the defense, the prosecution, or the court-martial. For example, in a prosecution for assault, testimony by prosecution witnesses that the victim brandished a weapon towardthe accused may raise a defense of self-defense. _ See_ subsection(e) below. More than one defense may be raised as to a particular offense.The defenses need not necessarily be consistent. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 920(e)(3) concerning instructions on defenses.Justification.A death, injury, or other act caused or done in the proper performanceof a legal duty is justified and not unlawful.DiscussionThe duty may be imposed by statute, regulation, or order. For example,the use of force by a law enforcement officer when reasonably necessary inthe proper execution of a lawful apprehension is justified because the dutyto apprehend is imposed by lawful authority. Also, killing an enemy combatantin battle is justified.Obedience to orders.It is a defense to any offense that the accused was acting pursuant to orders unless the accused knew the orders to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawful.DiscussionOrdinarily the lawfulness of an order is finally decided by the military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 801(e). An exception might exist when the sole issue is whether the person who gave the order in fact occupieda certain position at the time. 

 An act performed pursuantto a lawful order is justified. _See_ subsection (c) of thisrule. An act performed pursuant to an unlawful order is excused unless theaccused knew it to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understandingwould have known it to be unlawful.Self-defense.Homicide or assault cases involving deadly force.It is a defense to a homicide, assault involving deadly force, or battery involving deadly force that the accused: Apprehended, on reasonable grounds, that death or grievous bodily harm was about to be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and Believed that the force the accused used was necessary for protection against death or grievous bodily harm.DiscussionThe words "involving deadly force" described the factual circumstances of the case, not specific assault offenses. If the accusedis charged with simple assault, battery or any form of aggravated assault,or if simple assault, battery or any form of aggravated assault is in issueas a lesser included offense, the accused may rely on this subsection ifthe test specified in subsections (A) and (B) is satisfied. 

 Thetest for the first element of self-defense is objective. Thus, the accused'sapprehension of death or grievous bodily harm must have been one which areasonable, prudent person would have held under the circumstances. Becausethis test is objective, such matters as intoxication or emotional instability of the accused are irrelevant. On the other hand, such matters as the relative height, weight, and general build of the accused and the alleged victim,and the possibility of safe retreat are ordinarily among the circumstanceswhich should be considered in determining the reasonableness of the apprehensionof death or grievous bodily harm. 

 The test for the secondelement is entirely subjective. The accused is not objectively limited tothe use of reasonable force. Accordingly, such matters as the accused's emotionalcontrol, education, and intelligence are relevant in determining the accused'sactual belief as to the force necessary to repel the attack. 

 _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 404(a)(2) as to evidence concerning the character of the victim.Certain aggravated assault cases.It is a defense to assault with a dangerous weapon or means likelyto produce death or grievous bodily harm that the accused: Apprehended, on reasonable grounds, that bodily harm was about tobe inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and In order to deter the assailant, offered but did not actually apply or attempt to apply such means or force as would be likely to cause deathor grievous bodily harm.DiscussionThe principles in the discussion of subsection (e)(1) of this rule concerning reasonableness of the apprehension of bodily harm apply here. 

 If,as a result of the accused's offer of a means or force likely to producegrievous bodily harm, the victim was killed or injured unintentionally bythe accused, this aspect of self-defense may operate in conjunction withthe defense of accident (_see_ subsection (f) of this rule)to excuse the accused's acts. The death or injury must have been an unintendedand unexpected result of the accused's exercise of the right of self-defense.Other assaults.It is a defense to any assault punishable under Article 90, 91,or 128 and not listed in subsections (e)(1) or (2) of this rule that theaccused: Apprehended, upon reasonable grounds, that bodily harm was aboutto be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and Believed that the force that accused used was necessary for protectionagainst bodily harm, provided that the force used by the accused was lessthan force reasonably likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.DiscussionThe principles in the discussion under subsection (e)(1) apply here. 

 If,in using only such force as the accused was entitled to use under this aspectof self-defense, death or serious injury to the victim results, this aspectof self-defense may operate in conjunction with the defense of accident(_see_ subsection (f) of this rule) to excuse the accused'sacts. The death or serious injury must have been an unintended and unexpectedresult of the accused's proper exercise of the right of self-defense.Loss of right to self-defense.The right to self-defense is lost and the defenses described in subsections (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this rule shall not apply if the accusedwas an aggressor, engaged in mutual combat, or provoked the attack whichgave rise to the apprehension, unless the accused had withdrawn in good faithafter the aggression, combat, or provocation and before the offense allegedoccurred.DiscussionA person does not become an aggressor or provocateur merely because that person approaches another to seek an interview, even if the approachis not made in a friendly manner. For example, one may approach anotherand demand an explanation of offensive words or redress of a complaint. Ifthe approach is made in a nonviolent manner, the right to self-defense isnot lost. 

 Failure to retreat, when retreat is possible,does not deprive the accused of the right to self-defense if the accusedwas lawfully present. The availability of avenues of retreat is one factor which may be considered in addressing the reasonableness of the accused's apprehension of bodily harm and the sincerity of the accused's belief thatthe force used was necessary for self-protection.Defense of another.The principles of self-defense under subsection (e)(1) through (4)of this rule apply to defense of another. It is a defense to homicide, attemptedhomicide, assault with intent to kill, or any assault under Article 90,91, or 128 that the accused acted in defense of another, provided that the accused may not use more force than the person defended was lawfully entitledto use under the circumstances.DiscussionThe accused acts at the accused's peril when defending another.Thus, if the accused goes to the aid of an apparent assault victim, theaccused is guilty of any assault the accused commits on the apparent assailantif, unbeknownst to the accused, the apparent victim was in fact the aggressorand not entitled to use self-defense.Accident.A death, injury, or other event which occurs as the unintentionaland unexpected result of doing a lawful act in a lawful manner is an accidentand excusable.DiscussionThe defense of accident is not available when the act which caused the death, injury, or event was a negligent act.Entrapment.It is a defense that the criminal design or suggestion to committhe offense originated in the Government and the accused had no predispositionto commit the offense.DiscussionThe "Government" includes agents of the Government and persons cooperating with them (for example, informants). The fact that personsacting for the Government merely afford opportunities or facilities forthe commission of the offense does not constitute entrapment. Entrapmentoccurs only when the criminal conduct is the product of the creative activityof law enforcement officials. 

 When the defense of entrapmentis raised, evidence of uncharged misconduct by the accused of a nature similarto that charged is admissible to show predisposition. _See_ Mil.R. Evid. 404(b).Coercion or duress.It is a defense to any offense except killing an innocent personthat the accused's participation in the offense was caused by a reasonableapprehension that the accused or another innocent person would be immediatelykilled or would immediately suffer serious bodily injury if the accused didnot commit the act. The apprehension must reasonably continue throughoutthe commission of the act. If the accused has any reasonable opportunityto avoid committing the act without subjecting the accused or another innocentperson to the harm threatened, this defense shall not apply.DiscussionThe immediacy of the harm necessary may vary with the circumstances. For example, a threat to kill a person's wife the next day may be immediateif the person has no opportunity to contact law enforcement officials orotherwise protect the intended victim or avoid committing the offense beforethen.Inability.It is a defense to refusal or failure to perform a duty that the accused was, through no fault of the accused, not physically or financiallyable to perform the duty.DiscussionThe test of inability is objective in nature. The accused's opinion that a physical impairment prevented performance of the duty will not sufficeunless the opinion is reasonable under all the circumstances. 

 Ifthe physical or financial inability of the accused occurred through the accused'sown fault or design, it is not a defense. For example, if the accused, havingknowledge of an order to get a haircut, spends money on other nonessentialitems, the accused's inability to pay for the haircut would not be a defense.Ignorance or mistake of fact.Generally.Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, it is a defenseto an offense that the accused held, as a result of ignorance or mistake,an incorrect belief of the true circumstances such that, if the circumstances were as the accused believed them, the accused would not be guilty of the offense. If the ignorance or mistake goes to an element requiring premeditation,specific intent, willfulness, or knowledge of a particular fact, the ignoranceor mistake need only have existed in the mind of the accused. If the ignoranceor mistake goes to any other element requiring only general intent or knowledge,the ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of the accused andmust have been reasonable under all the circumstances. However, if the accused's knowledge or intent is immaterial as to an element, then ignorance or mistake is not a defense. Child Sexual Offenses.It is a defense to a prosecution for Article 120b(b), sexual assault of a child, and Article 120b(c), sexual abuse of a child, that, at the time of the offense, the accused reasonably believed that the child had attained the age of 16 years, if the child had in fact attained at least the age of 12 years. The accused must prove this defense by a preponderance of the evidence.DiscussionExamples of ignorance or mistake which need only exist in fact include: ignorance of the fact that the person assaulted was an officer; belief that property allegedly stolen belonged to the accused; belief that a controlled substance was really sugar.

 Examples of ignorance or mistake which must be reasonable as well as actual include: belief that the accused charged with unauthorized absence had permission to go; belief that the accused had a medical "profile" excusing shaving as otherwise required by regulation. Some offenses require special standards of conduct (see, for example, paragraph 68, Part IV, Dishonorable failure to maintain sufficient funds); the element of reasonableness must be applied in accordance with the standards imposed by such offenses.

 Examples of offenses in which the accused's intent or knowledge is immaterial include: any rape of a child, or any sexual assault or sexual abuse of a child when the child is under 12 years old. However, such ignorance or mistake may be relevant in extenuation and mitigation.

 _See_ subsection (l)(1) of this rule concerning ignorance or mistake of law.Lack of mental responsibility.Lack of mental responsibility.It is an affirmative defense to any offense that, at the time ofthe commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a resultof a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his or her acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 706 concerning sanity inquiries; R.C.M.909 concerning the capacity of the accused to stand trial; and R.C.M. 1102Aconcerning any post-trial hearing for an accused found not guilty only byreason of lack of mental responsibility.Partial mental responsibility.A mental condition not amounting to a lack of mental responsibility under subsection (k)(1) of this rule is not an affirmative defense.DiscussionEvidence of a mental condition not amounting to a lack of mentalresponsibility may be admissible as to whether the accused entertained a stateof mind necessary to be proven as an element of the offense. The defensemust notify the trial counsel before the beginning of trial on the meritsif the defense intends to introduce expert testimony as to the accused's mentalcondition. _See_ R.C.M. 701(b)(2).Procedure.Presumption.The accused is presumed to have been mentally responsible at thetime of the alleged offense. This presumption continues until the accusedestablishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or she was not mentallyresponsible at the time of the alleged offense.DiscussionThe accused is presumed to be mentally responsible, and this presumptioncontinues throughout the proceedings unless the finder of fact determinesthat the accused has proven lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincingevidence. _See_ subsection (b) of this rule.Inquiry.If a question is raised concerning the mental responsibility ofthe accused, the military judge shall rule finally whether to direct aninquiry under R.C.M. 706. In a special court-martial without a military judge, the president shall rule finally except to the extent that the question isone of fact, in which case the president rules subject to objection by anymember.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(3) for the procedures for votingon rulings of the president of a special court-martial without a militaryjudge. 

 If an inquiry is directed, priority should be givento it.Determination.The issue of mental responsibility shall not be considered as an interlocutory question. Not defenses generally.Ignorance or mistake of law.Ignorance or mistake of law, including general orders or regulations, ordinarily is not a defense.DiscussionFor example, ignorance that it is a crime to possess marijuana isnot a defense to wrongful possession of marijuana. 

 Ignoranceor mistake of law may be a defense in some limited circumstances. If theaccused, because of a mistake as to a separate nonpenal law, lacks the criminalintent or state of mind necessary to establish guilt, this may be a defense.For example, if the accused, under mistaken belief that the accused is entitledto take an item under property law, takes an item, this mistake of law (asto the accused's legal right) would, if genuine, be a defense to larceny.On the other hand, if the accused disobeyed an order, under the actual butmistaken belief that the order was unlawful, this would not be a defensebecause the accused's mistake was as to the order itself, and not as to aseparate nonpenal law. Also, mistake of law may be a defense when the mistakeresults from reliance on the decision or pronouncement of an authorized public official or agency. For example, if an accused, acting on the advice of an official responsible for administering benefits that the accused is entitledto those benefits, applies for and receives those benefits, the accusedmay have a defense even though the accused was not legally eligible for the benefits. On the other hand, reliance on the advice of counsel that a certaincourse of conduct is legal is not, of itself, a defense.Voluntary intoxication.Voluntary intoxication, whether caused by alcohol or drugs, is nota defense. However, evidence of any degree of voluntary intoxication maybe introduced for the purpose of raising a reasonable doubt as to the existenceof actual knowledge, specific intent, willfulness, or a premeditated designto kill, if actual knowledge, specific intent, willfulness, or premeditateddesign to kill is an element of the offense.DiscussionIntoxication may reduce premeditated murder to unpremeditated murder, but it will not reduce murder to manslaughter or any other lesser offense. _See_ paragraph 43c(2)(c), Part IV. 

 Although voluntaryintoxication is not a defense, evidence of voluntary intoxication may beadmitted in extenuation.Motion for a finding of not guiltyIn general.The military judge, on motion by the accused or _sua sponte_, shall enter a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses chargedafter the evidence on either side is closed and before findings on the generalissue of guilt are announced if the evidence is insufficient to sustain aconviction of the offense affected. If a motion for a finding of not guiltyat the close of the prosecution's case is denied, the defense may offerevidence on that offense without having reserved the right to do so. Form of motion.The motion shall specifically indicate wherein the evidence isinsufficient. Procedure.Before ruling on a motion for a finding of not guilty, whether made by counsel or _sua sponte_, the military judge shall giveeach party an opportunity to be heard on the matter.DiscussionThe military judge ordinarily should permit the trial counsel to reopen the case as to the insufficiency specified in the motion. 

 _ See_ R.C.M. 801(e)(2) and (3) for additional procedures to be followedin a special court-martial without a military judge. _See_ R.C.M. 1102(b)(2) for the military judge's authority, upon motion or sua sponte, to enter finding of not guilty after findings but prior to authentication of the record.Standard.A motion for a finding of not guilty shall be granted only in the absence of some evidence which, together with all reasonable inferencesand applicable presumptions, could reasonably tend to establish every essentialelement of an offense charged. The evidence shall be viewed in the lightmost favorable to the prosecution, without an evaluation of the credibilityof witnesses. Motion as to greater offense.A motion for a finding of not guilty may be granted as to part ofa specification and, if appropriate, the corresponding charge, as long asa lesser offense charged is alleged in the portion of the specificationas to which the motion is not granted. In such cases, the military judge shall announce that a finding of not guilty has been granted as to specified languagein the specification and, if appropriate, corresponding charge. In casesbefore members, the military judge shall instruct the members accordingly,so that any findings later announced will not be inconsistent with the grantingof the motion. Effect of ruling.A ruling granting a motion for a finding of not guilty is finalwhen announced and may not be reconsidered. Such a ruling is a finding ofnot guilty of the affected specification, or affected portion thereof, and,when appropriate, of the corresponding charge. A ruling denying a motionfor a finding of not guilty may be reconsidered at any time prior to authenticationof the record of trial. Effect of denial on review.If all the evidence admitted before findings, regardless by whom offered, is sufficient to sustain findings of guilty, the findings neednot be set aside upon review solely because the motion for finding of notguilty should have been granted upon the state of the evidence when it was made. FindingsGeneral findings.The general findings of a court-martial state whether the accusedis guilty of each offense charged. If two or more accused are tried together,separate findings as to each shall be made. As to a specification.General findings as to a specification may be: guilty; not guiltyof an offense as charged, but guilty of a named lesser included offense;guilty with exceptions, with or without substitutions, not guilty of theexceptions, but guilty of the substitutions, if any; not guilty only by reasonof lack of mental responsibility; or, not guilty. Exceptions and substitutionsmay not be used to substantially change the nature of the offense or toincrease the seriousness of the offense or the maximum punishment for it.Discussion _Exceptions and Substitutions._ One or more words or figures may be excepted from a specification and, when necessary, others substituted, if the remaining language of the specification, with or without substitutions, states an offense by the accused which is punishable by the court-martial. Changing the date or place of the offense may, but does not necessarily, change the nature or identity of an offense.

 If A and B are joint accused and A is convicted but B is acquitted of an offense charged, A should be found guilty by excepting the name of B from the specification as well as any other words indicating the offense was a joint one.

 _Lesser Included Offenses._ If the evidence fails to prove the offense charged but does prove an offense necessarily included in the offense charged, the fact finder may find the accused not guilty of the offense charged but guilty of the lesser included offense. _See_ paragraph 3 of Part IV concerning lesser included offenses.

 _Offenses arising from the same act or transaction._ The accused may be found guilty of two or more offenses arising from the same act or transaction, whether or not the offenses are separately punishable. _But see_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12); 907(b)(3)(B); 1003(c)(1)(C). As to a charge. General findings as to a charge may be: guilty; not guilty, but guilty of a violation of Article ; not guilty onlyby reason of lack of mental responsibility; or not guilty.DiscussionWhere there are two or more specifications under one charge, convictionof any of those specifications requires a finding of guilty of the correspondingcharge. Under such circumstances any findings of not guilty as to the otherspecifications do not affect that charge. If the accused is found guiltyof one specification and of a lesser included offense prohibited by a differentArticle as to another specification under the same charge, the findingsas to the corresponding charge should be:"Of the Charge as to specification1: Guilty; as to specification 2: not guilty, but guilty of a violation ofArticle ." 

 An attempt should be foundas a violation of Article 80 unless the attempt is punishable under Articles85, 94, 100, 104, or 128, in which case it should be found as a violationof that Article. 

 A court-martial may not find an offenseas a violation of an article under which it was not charged solely for thepurpose of increasing the authorized punishment or for the purpose of adjudgingless than the prescribed mandatory punishment.Special findings.In a trial by court-martial composed of military judge alone, the military judge shall make special findings upon request by any party. Specialfindings may be requested only as to matters of fact reasonably in issueas to an offense and need be made only as to offenses of which the accusedwas found guilty. Special findings may be requested at any time before generalfindings are announced. Only one set of special findings may be requestedby a party in a case. If the request is for findings on specific matters,the military judge may require that the request be written. Special findingsmay be entered orally on the record at the court-martial or in writing duringor after the court-martial, but in any event shall be made before authenticationand included in the record of trial.DiscussionSpecial findings ordinarily include findings as to the elementsof the offenses of which the accused has been found guilty, and any affirmativedefense relating thereto. 

 _See also_ R.C.M.905(d); Mil. R. Evid. 304(d)(4); 311(d)(4); 321(f) concerning other findingsto be made by the military judge. 

 Members may not make specialfindings.Basis of findings.Findings may be based on direct or circumstantial evidence. Only matters properly before the court-martial on the merits of the case maybe considered. A finding of guilty of any offense may be reached only whenthe factfinder is satisfied that guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.DiscussionDirect evidence is evidence which tends directly to prove or disprove a fact in issue (for example, an element of the offense charged). Circumstantialevidence is evidence which tends directly to prove not a fact in issue butsome other fact or circumstance from which, either alone or together withother facts or circumstances, one may reasonably infer the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue. There is no general rule for determining or comparingthe weight to be given to direct or circumstantial evidence. 

 Areasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense. A reasonabledoubt is not mere conjecture; it is an honest, conscientious doubt suggestedby the evidence, or lack of it, in the case. An absolute or mathematicalcertainty is not required. The rule as to reasonable doubt extends to everyelement of the offense. It is not necessary that each particular fact advancedby the prosecution which is not an element be proved beyond a reasonabledoubt. 

 The factfinder should consider the inherent probabilityor improbability of the evidence, using common sense and knowledge of humannature, and should weigh the credibility of witnesses. A fact finder mayproperly believe one witness and disbelieve others whose testimony conflictswith that of the one. A factfinder may believe part of the testimony of awitness and disbelieve other parts. 

 Findings of guilty maynot be based solely on the testimony of a witness other than the accusedwhich is self-contradictory, unless the contradiction is adequately explainedby the witness. Even if apparently credible and corroborated, the testimonyof an accomplice should be considered with great caution. Argument by counsel on findingsIn general.After the closing of evidence, trial counsel shall be permittedto open the argument. The defense counsel shall be permitted to reply. Trialcounsel shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. Contents.Arguments may properly include reasonable comment on the evidencein the case, including inferences to be drawn therefrom, in support of aparty's theory of the case.DiscussionThe military judge may exercise reasonable control over argument. _See_ R.C.M. 801(a)(3). 

 Argument may includecomment about the testimony, conduct, motives, interests, and biases ofwitnesses to the extent supported by the evidence. Counsel should not expressa personnel belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimonyor evidence or the guilt or innocence of the accused, nor should counselmake arguments calculated to inflame passions or prejudices. In argumentcounsel may treat the testimony of witnesses as conclusively establishingthe facts related by the witnesses. Counsel may not cite legal authoritiesor the facts of other cases when arguing to members on findings.

 Trialcounsel may not comment on the accused's exercise of the right against self-incrimination or the right to counsel. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 512. Trial counsel may not argue that the prosecution's evidence is unrebutted if the onlyrebuttal could come from the accused. When the accused is on trial for severaloffenses and testifies only as to some of the offenses, trial counsel maynot comment on the accused's failure to testify as to the others. When theaccused testifies on the merits regarding an offense charged, trial counselmay comment on the accused's failure in that testimony to deny or explainspecific incriminating facts that the evidence for the prosecution tendsto establish regarding that offense.

 Trial counsel maynot comment on the failure of the defense to call witnesses or of the accusedto testify at the Article 32 preliminary hearing or upon the probable effect ofthe court-martial's findings on relations between the military and civiliancommunities.

 The rebuttal argument of trial counsel is generallylimited to matters argued by the defense. If trial counsel is permittedto introduce new matter in closing argument, the defense should be allowed to reply in rebuttal. However, this will not preclude trial counsel from presenting a final argument.Waiver of objection to improper argument.Failure to object to improper argument before the military judge begins to instruct the members on findings shall constitute waiver of theobjection.DiscussionIf an objection that an argument is improper is sustained, themilitary judge should immediately instruct the members that the argumentwas improper and that they must disregard it. In extraordinary cases improperargument may require a mistrial. _See_ R.C.M. 915. The militaryjudge should be alert to improper argument and take appropriate action whennecessary.Instructions on findingsIn general.The military judge shall give the members appropriate instructionson findings.DiscussionInstructions consist of a statement of the issues in the case andan explanation of the legal standards and procedural requirements by whichthe members will determine findings. Instructions should be tailored tofit the circumstances of the case, and should fairly and adequately coverthe issues presented. When given.Instructions on findings shall be given before or after argumentsby counsel, or at both times, and before the members close to deliberateon findings, but the military judge may, upon request of the members, anyparty, or _sua sponte_, give additional instructions at alater time.DiscussionAfter members have reached a finding on a specification, instructions may not be given on an offense included therein which was not describedin an earlier instruction unless the finding is illegal. This is true evenif the finding has not been announced. When instructions are to be givenis a matter within the sole discretion of the military trial judge.Requests for instructions.At the close of the evidence or at such other time as the military judge may permit, any party may request that the military judge instructthe members on the law as set forth in the request. The military judge mayrequire the requested instruction to be written. Each party shall be giventhe opportunity to be heard on any proposed instruction on findings beforeit is given. The military judge shall inform the parties of the proposedaction on such requests before their closing arguments.DiscussionRequests for and objections to instructions should be resolved atan Article 39(a) session. _But see_ R.C.M 801(e)(3); 803. 

 Ifan issue has been raised, ordinarily the military judge must instruct onthe issue when requested to do so. The military judge is not required togive the specific instruction requested by counsel, however, as long asthe issue is adequately covered in the instructions. 

 Themilitary judge should not identify the source of any instruction when addressingthe members. 

 All written requests for instructions shouldbe marked as appellate exhibits, whether or not they are given.How given.Instructions on findings shall be given orally on the record inthe presence of all parties and the members. Written copies of the instructions,or, unless a party objects, portions of them, may also be given to the membersfor their use during deliberations.DiscussionA copy of any written instructions delivered to the members shouldbe marked as an appellate exhibit.Required instructions.Instructions on findings shall include: A description of the elements of each offense charged, unless findingson such offenses are unnecessary because they have been entered pursuantto a plea of guilty; A description of the elements of each lesser included offense in issue, unless trial of a lesser included offense is barred by the statuteof limitations (Article 43) and the accused refuses to waive the bar; A description of any special defense under R.C.M. 916 in issue;A direction that only matters properly before the court-martialmay be considered; A charge that- The accused must be presumed to be innocent until the accused'sguilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;In the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt asto the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of theaccused and the accused must be acquitted; If, when a lesser included offense is in issue, there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt of the accused, the finding must be in alower degree as to which there is not reasonable doubt; and The burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused is upon the Government. --LSQP--When the issue of lack of mental responsibility is raised, add: The burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence is upon the accused. When the issue of mistake of fact under R.C.M. 916(j)(2) is raised, add: The accused has the burden of proving the defense of mistake of fact as to age by a preponderance of the evidence.--RSQP--Directions on the procedures under R.C.M. 921 for deliberationsand voting; and Such other explanations, descriptions, or directions as may benecessary and which are properly requested by a party or which the militaryjudge determines, _sua sponte_, should be given.DiscussionA matter is "in issue" when some evidence, without regard to its source or credibility, has been admitted upon which members mightrely if they choose. An instruction on a lesser included offense is properwhen an element from the charged offense which distinguishes thatoffensefrom the lesser offense is in dispute. 

 _See_ R.C.M.918(c) and discussion as to reasonable doubt and other matters relatingto the basis for findings which may be the subject of an instruction. 

 Othermatters which may be the subject of instruction in appropriate cases included:inferences (_see_ the explanations in Part IV concerning inferences relating to specific offenses); the limited purpose for which evidence wasadmitted (regardless of whether such evidence was offered by the prosecutionof defense) (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 105); the effect of characterevidence (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 404; 405); the effect of judicialnotice (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 201, 201A); the weight to begiven a pretrial statement (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 340(e)); theeffect of stipulations (_see_ R.C.M. 811); that, when a guiltyplea to a lesser included offense has been accepted, the members shouldaccept as proved the matters admitted by the plea, but must determine whether the remaining elements are established; that a plea of guilty to one offense may not be the basis for inferring the existence of a fact or element ofanother offense; the absence of the accused from trial should not be held against the accused; and that no adverse inferences may be drawn from an accused's failure to testify (_see_ Mil. R. Evid. 301(g)). 

 Themilitary judge may summarize and comment upon evidence in the case in instructions. In doing so, the military judge should present an accurate, fair, and dispassionatestatement of what the evidence shows; not depart from an impartial role;not assume as true the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue whenthe evidence is conflicting or disputed, or when there is no evidence tosupport the matter; and make clear that the members must exercise their independentjudgment as to the facts.Waiver.Failure to object to an instruction or to omission of an instruction before the members close to deliberate constitutes waiver of the objectionin the absence of plain error. The military judge may require the partyobjecting to specify of what respect the instructions given were improper.The parties shall be given the opportunity to be heard on any objection outsidethe presence of the members. Deliberations and voting on findingsIn general.After the military judge instructs the members on findings, the members shall deliberate and vote in a closed session. Only the membersshall be present during deliberations and voting. Superiority in rank shallnot be used in any manner in an attempt to control the independence of membersin the exercise of their judgment. Deliberations.Deliberations properly include full and free discussion of the merits of the case. Unless otherwise directed by the military judge, members maytake with them in deliberations their notes, if any, any exhibits admittedin evidence, and any written instructions. Members may request that the court-martialbe reopened and that portions of the record be read to them or additionalevidence introduced. The military judge may, in the exercise of discretion,grant such request. Voting.Secret ballot. Voting on the findings for each charge and specification shallbe by secret written ballot. All members present shall vote. Numbers of votes required to convict.Death penalty mandatory.A finding of guilty of an offense for which the death penalty is mandatory results only if all members present vote for a finding of guilty.DiscussionArticle 106 is the only offense under the code for which the death penalty is mandatory.Other offenses.As to any offense for which the death penalty is not mandatory,a finding of guilty results only if at least two-thirds of the members presentvote for a finding of guilty.DiscussionIn computing the number of votes required to convict, any fractionof a vote is rounded up to the next whole number. For example, if thereare five members, the concurrence of at least four would be required to convict. The military judge should instruct the members on the specific number ofvotes required to convict.Acquittal.If fewer than two-thirds of the members present vote for a findingof guilty-or, when the death penalty is mandatory, if fewer than allthe members present vote for a finding of guilty-a finding of notguilty has resulted as to the charge or specification on which the vote wastaken. Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.When the defense of lack of mental responsibility is in issue under R.C.M. 916(k)(1), the members shall first vote on whether the prosecutionhas proven the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. If atleast two-thirds of the members present (all members for offenses where thedeath penalty is mandatory) vote for a finding of guilty, then the membersshall vote on whether the accused has proven lack of mental responsibility.If a majority of the members present concur that the accused has proven lackof mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence, a finding of notguilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility results. If the voteon lack of mental responsibility does not result in a finding of not guiltyonly by reason of lack of mental responsibility, then the defense of lackof mental responsibility has been rejected and the finding of guilty stands.DiscussionIf lack of mental responsibility is in issue with regard to morethan one specification, the members should determine the issue of lack ofmental responsibility on each specification separately.Included offenses.Members shall not vote on a lesser included offense unless a finding of not guilty of the offense charged has been reached. If a finding of notguilty of an offense charged has been reached the members shall vote oneach included offense on which they have been instructed, in order of severitybeginning with the most severe. The members shall continue the vote on eachincluded offense on which they have been instructed until a finding of guiltyresults or findings of not guilty have been reached as to each such offense.Procedure for voting.Order.Each specification shall be voted on separately before the correspondingcharge. The order of voting on several specifications under a charge or onseveral charges shall be determined by the president unless a majority ofthe members object. Counting votes.The junior member shall collect the ballots and count the votes.The president shall check the count and inform the other members of theresult.DiscussionOnce findings have been reached, they may be reconsidered only in accordance with R.C.M. 924.Action after findings are reached.After the members have reached findings on each charge and specificationbefore them, the court-martial shall be opened and the president shall informthe military judge that findings have been reached. The military judge may,in the presence of the parties, examine any writing which the president intendsto read to announce the findings and may assist the members in putting the findings in proper form. Neither that writing nor any oral or written clarificationor discussion concerning it shall constitute announcement of the findings.DiscussionOrdinarily a findings worksheet should be provided to the membersas an aid to putting the findings in proper form. _See_ Appendix10 for a format for findings. If the military judge examines any writingby the members or otherwise assists them to put findings in proper form,this must be done in an open session and counsel should be given the opportunityto examine such a writing and to be heard on any instructions the militaryjudge may give. _See_ Article 39(b). 

 Thepresident should not disclose any specific number of votes for or againstany finding.Announcement of findingsIn general.Findings shall be announced in the presence of all parties promptly after they have been determined. Discussion _See_ Appendix 10. A finding of an offense aboutwhich no instructions were given is not proper.Findings by members.The president shall announce the findings by the members. If a finding is based on a plea of guilty, the president shall so state. In a capital case, if a finding of guilty is unanimous with respect to a capital offense, the president shall so state. This provision shallnot apply during reconsideration under R.C.M. 924(a) of a finding of guiltypreviously announced in open court unless the prior finding was announcedas unanimous.DiscussionIf the findings announced are ambiguous, the military judge should seek clarification. _See also_ R.C.M. 924. A nonunanimousfinding of guilty as to a capital offense may be reconsidered, but not forthe purpose of rendering a unanimous verdict in order to authorize a capitalsentencing proceeding. The president shall not make a statement regardingunanimity with respect to reconsideration of findings as to an offense inwhich the prior findings were not unanimous.Findings by military judge.The military judge shall announce the findings when trial is by military judge alone or when findings may be entered upon R.C.M. 910(g).Erroneous announcement.If an error was made in the announcement of the findings of the court-martial, the error may be corrected by a new announcement in accordancewith this rule. The error must be discovered and the new announcement madebefore the final adjournment of the court-martial in the case.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 1102 concerning the action to be takenif the error in the announcement is discovered after final adjournment.Polling prohibited.Except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 606, members may not be questionedabout their deliberations and voting. Impeachment of findingsFindings which are proper on their face may be impeached only when extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the attentionof a member, outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member,or unlawful command influence was brought to bear upon any member.DiscussionDeliberations of the members ordinarily are not subject to disclosure. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 606. Unsound reasoning by a member, misconceptionof the evidence, or misapplication of the law is not a proper basis forchallenging the findings. However, when a showing of a ground for impeachingthe verdict has been made, members may be questioned about such a ground.The military judge determines, as an interlocutory matter, whether suchan inquiry will be conducted and whether a finding has been impeached.Reconsideration of findingsTime for reconsideration.Members may reconsider any finding reached by them before suchfinding is announced in open session. Procedure.Any member may propose that a finding be reconsidered. If such a proposal is made in a timely manner the question whether to reconsider shallbe determined in closed session by secret written ballot. Any finding ofnot guilty shall be reconsidered if a majority vote for reconsideration.Any finding of guilty shall be reconsidered if more than one-third of themembers vote for reconsideration. When the death penalty is mandatory, arequest by any member for reconsideration of a guilty finding requires reconsideration.Any finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibilityshall be reconsidered on the issue of the finding of guilty of the elementsif more than one-third of the members vote for reconsideration, and on theissue of mental responsibility if a majority vote for reconsideration. Ifa vote to reconsider a finding succeeds, the procedures in R.C.M. 921 shallapply.DiscussionAfter the initial secret ballot vote on a finding in closed session, no other vote may be taken on that finding unless a vote to reconsider succeeds.Military judge sitting alone.In trial by military judge alone, the military judge may reconsider any finding of guilty at any time before announcement of sentence and mayreconsider the issue of the finding of guilty of the elements in a findingof not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility at any timebefore announcement of sentence or authentication of the record of trialin the case of a complete acquittal. SENTENCINGPresentencing procedureIn general.Procedure.After findings of guilty have been announced, the prosecution and defense may present matter pursuant to this rule to aid the court-martialin determining an appropriate sentence. Such matter shall ordinarily bepresented in the following sequence-Presentation by trial counsel of:service data relating to the accused taken from the charge sheet;personal data relating to the accused and of the character of the accused's prior service as reflected in the personnel records of the accused;evidence of prior convictions, military or civilian;evidence of aggravation; andevidence of rehabilitative potential.Victim's right to be reasonably heard. _See_ R.C.M. 1001A.Presentation by the defense of evidence in extenuation or mitigation or both.Rebuttal.Argument by trial counsel on sentence. Argument by defense counsel on sentence.Rebuttal arguments in the discretion of the military judge.Adjudging sentence.A sentence shall be adjudged in all cases without unreasonabledelay.Advice and inquiry.The military judge shall personally inform the accused of the right to present matters in extenuation and mitigation, including the right tomake a sworn or unsworn statement or to remain silent, and shall ask whetherthe accused chooses to exercise those rights.Matter to be presented by the prosecution.Service data from the charge sheet.Trial counsel shall inform the court-martial of the data on the charge sheet relating to the pay and service of the accused and the durationand nature of any pretrial restraint. In the discretion of the militaryjudge, this may be done by reading the material from the charge sheet orby giving the court-martial a written statement of such matter. If the defenseobjects to the data as being materially inaccurate or incomplete, or containingspecified objectionable matter, the military judge shall determine the issue. Objections not asserted are waived.Personal data and character of prior service of the accused.Under regulations of the Secretary concerned, trial counsel may obtain and introduce from the personnel records of the accused evidence ofthe accused's marital status; number of dependents, if any; and characterof prior service. Such evidence includes copies of reports reflecting thepast military efficiency, conduct, performance, and history of the accusedand evidence of any disciplinary actions including punishments under Article15. 

 "Personnel records of the accused" includes any records made or maintained in accordance with departmental regulations thatreflect the past military efficiency, conduct, performance, and historyof the accused. If the accused objects to a particular document as inaccurateor incomplete in a specified respect, or as containing matter that is notadmissible under the Military Rules of Evidence, the matter shall be determinedby the military judge. Objections not asserted are waived.Evidence of prior convictions of the accused.In general.The trial counsel may introduce evidence of military or civilian convictions of the accused. For purposes of this rule, there is a "conviction"in a court-martial case when a sentence has been adjudged. In a civiliancase, a "conviction" includes any disposition following an initialjudicial determination or assumption of guilt, such as when guilt has beenestablished by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, regardlessof the subsequent disposition, sentencing procedure, or final judgment. However,a "civilian conviction" does not include a diversion from the judicial process without a finding or admission of guilt; expunged convictions;juvenile adjudications; minor traffic violations; foreign convictions; tribalcourt convictions; or convictions reversed, vacated, invalidated or pardonedbecause of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exoneratingthe accused.DiscussionA vacation of a suspended sentence (_see_ R.C.M.1109) is not a conviction and is not admissible as such, but may be admissibleunder subsection (b)(2) of this rule as reflective of the character of theprior service of the accused. 

 Whether a civilian convictionis admissible is left to the discretion of the military judge. As statedin the rule, a civilian "conviction" includes any dispositionfollowing an initial judicial determination or assumption of guilt regardlessof the sentencing procedure and the final judgment following probation orother sentence. Therefore, convictions may be admissible regardless of whethera court ultimately suspended judgment upon discharge of the accused followingprobation, permitted withdrawal of the guilty plea, or applies some otherform of alternative sentencing. Additionally, the term "conviction"need not be taken to mean a final judgment of conviction and sentence.Pendency of appeal.The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence ofa conviction inadmissible except that a conviction by summary court-martialor special court-martial without a military judge may not be used for purposesof this rule until review has been completed pursuant to Article 64 or Article66, if applicable. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.Method of proof.Previous convictions may be proved by any evidence admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence. DiscussionNormally, previous convictions may be proved by use of the personnel records of the accused, by the record of the conviction, or by the order promulgating the result of trial. _See_ DD Form 493 (Extractof Military Records of Previous Convictions).Evidence in aggravation.The trial counsel may present evidence as to any aggravating circumstancesdirectly relating to or resulting from the offenses of which the accusedhas been found guilty. Evidence in aggravation includes, but is not limitedto, evidence of financial, social, psychological, and medical impact on orcost to any person or entity who was the victim of an offense committed bythe accused and evidence of significant adverse impact on the mission, discipline,or efficiency of the command directly and immediately resulting from theaccused's offense. In addition, evidence in aggravation may include evidencethat the accused intentionally selected any victim or any property as theobject of the offense because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion,national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation ofany person. Except in capital cases a written or oral deposition taken inaccordance with R.C.M. 702 is admissible in aggravation.Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 1004 concerning aggravating circumstancesin capital cases.Evidence of rehabilitative potential.Rehabilitative potential refers to the accused's potential to be restored, through vocational, correctional, or therapeutic training or other corrective measures to a useful and constructive place in society.In general.The trial counsel may present, by testimony or oral deposition in accordance with R.C.M. 702(g)(1), evidence in the form of opinions concerning the accused's previous performance as a servicemember and potential forrehabilitation. Foundation for opinion.The witness or deponent providing opinion evidence regarding the accused's rehabilitative potential must possess sufficient information and knowledge about the accused to offer a rationally-based opinion that ishelpful to the sentencing authority. Relevant information and knowledgeinclude, but are not limited to, information and knowledge about the accused's character, performance of duty, moral fiber, determination to be rehabilitated, and nature and severity of the offense or offenses.Discussion_See generally_ Mil. R. Evid. 701, Opinion testimony by lay witnesses. _See also_ Mil. R. Evid. 703, Bases ofopinion testimony by experts, if the witness or deponent is testifying asan expert. The types of information and knowledge reflected in this subparagraphare illustrative only.Bases for opinion.An opinion regarding the accused's rehabilitative potential mustbe based upon relevant information and knowledge possessed by the witnessor deponent, and must relate to the accused's personal circumstances. Theopinion of the witness or deponent regarding the severity or nature of theaccused's offense or offenses may not serve as the principal basis for anopinion of the accused's rehabilitative potential. Scope of opinion.An opinion offered under this rule is limited to whether the accused has rehabilitative potential and to the magnitude or quality of any such potential. A witness may not offer an opinion regarding the appropriatenessof a punitive discharge or whether the accused should be returned to theaccused's unit.DiscussionOn direct examination, a witness or deponent may respond affirmativelyor negatively regarding whether the accused has rehabilitative potential. The witness or deponent may also opine succinctly regarding the magnitudeor quality of the accused rehabilitative potential; for example, the witnessor deponent may opine that the accused has "great" or "little"rehabilitative potential. The witness or deponent, however, generally maynot further elaborate on the accused's rehabilitative potential, such asdescribing the particular reasons for forming the opinion.Cross-examination.On cross-examination, inquiry is permitted into relevant and specific instances of conduct. Redirect.Notwithstanding any other provision in this rule, the scope ofopinion testimony permitted on redirect may be expanded, depending upon thenature and scope of the cross-examination.DiscussionFor example, on redirect a witness or deponent may testify regarding specific instances of conduct when the cross-examination of the witness or deponent concerned specific instances of misconduct. Similarly, for example, on redirect a witness or deponent may offer an opinion on matters beyondthe scope of the accused's rehabilitative potential if an opinion about such matters was elicited during cross-examination of the witness or deponentand is otherwise admissible.Matter to be presented by the defense.In general.The defense may present matters in rebuttal of any material presentedby the prosecution and may present matters in extenuation and mitigationregardless whether the defense offered evidence before findings. Matter in extenuation.Matter in extenuation of an offense serves to explain the circumstancessurrounding the commission of an offense, including those reasons for committingthe offense which do not constitute a legal justification or excuse. Matter in mitigation.Matter in mitigation of an offense is introduced to lessen thepunishment to be adjudged by the court-martial, or to furnish grounds fora recommendation of clemency. It includes the fact that nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 has been imposed for an offense growing out of the sameact or omission that constitutes the offense of which the accused has beenfound guilty, particular acts of good conduct or bravery and evidence ofthe reputation or record of the accused in the service for efficiency, fidelity,subordination, temperance, courage, or any other trait that is desirablein a servicemember. Statement by the accused.In general.The accused may testify, make an unsworn statement, or both inextenuation, in mitigation or to rebut matters presented by the prosecution,or for all three purposes whether or not the accused testified prior to findings. The accused may limit such testimony or statement to any one or more of the specifications of which the accused has been found guilty. This subsectiondoes not permit the filing of an affidavit of the accused. Testimony of the accused.The accused may give sworn oral testimony under this paragraph and shall be subject to cross-examination concerning it by the trial counselor examination on it by the court-martial, or both. Unsworn statement.The accused may make an unsworn statement and may not be cross-examinedby the trial counsel upon it or examined upon it by the court-martial. Theprosecution may, however, rebut any statements of facts therein. The unswornstatement may be oral, written, or both, and may be made by the accused,by counsel, or both.DiscussionAn unsworn statement ordinarily should not include what is properly argument, but inclusion of such matter by the accused when personally makingan oral statement normally should not be grounds for stopping the statement.Rules of evidence relaxed.The military judge may, with respect to matters in extenuation or mitigation or both, relax the rules of evidence. This may include admitting letters, affidavits, certificates of military and civil officers, and otherwritings of similar authenticity and reliability. Rebuttal and surrebuttal.The prosecution may rebut matters presented by the defense. The defense in surrebuttal may then rebut any rebuttal offered by the prosecution. Rebuttal and surrebuttal may continue, in the discretion of the militaryjudge. If the Military Rules of Evidence were relaxed under subsection (c)(3)of this rule, they may be relaxed during rebuttal and surrebuttal to thesame degree. Production of witnesses.In general.During the presentence proceedings, there shall be much greater latitude than on the merits to receive information by means other than testimonypresented through the personal appearance of witnesses. Whether a witnessshall be produced to testify during presentence proceedings is a matter withinthe discretion of the military judge, subject to the limitations in subsection(e)(2) of this rule.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 703 concerning the procedures for productionof witnesses.Limitations.A witness may be produced to testify during presentence proceedings through a subpoena or travel orders at Government expense only if-The testimony expected to be offered by the witness is necessaryfor consideration of a matter of substantial significance to a determinationof an appropriate sentence, including evidence necessary to resolve an allegedinaccuracy or dispute as to a material fact; The weight or credibility of the testimony is of substantial significanceto the determination of an appropriate sentence; The other party refuses to enter into a stipulation of fact containingthe matters to which the witness is expected to testify, except in an extraordinarycase when such a stipulation of fact would be an insufficient substitutefor the testimony; Other forms of evidence, such as oral depositions, written interrogatories,former testimony, or testimony by remote means would not be sufficient to meet the needs of the court-martialin the determination of an appropriate sentence; and The significance of the personal appearance of the witness to the determination of an appropriate sentence, when balanced against the practicaldifficulties of producing the witness, favors production of the witness.Factors to be considered include the costs of producing the witness, thetiming of the request for production of the witness, the potential delayin the presentencing proceeding that may be caused by the production ofthe witness, and the likelihood of significant interference with militaryoperational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.DiscussionThe procedures for receiving testimony via remote means and the definition thereof are contained in R.C.M. 914B.Additional matters to be considered.In addition to matters introduced under this rule, the court-martial may consider-That a plea of guilty is a mitigating factor; andAny evidence properly introduced on the merits before findings, including:Evidence of other offenses or acts of misconduct even if introduced for a limited purpose; and Evidence relating to any mental impairment or deficiency of the accused.DiscussionThe fact that the accused is of low intelligence or that, becauseof a mental or neurological condition the accused's ability to adhere tothe right is diminished, may be extenuating. On the other hand, in determiningthe severity of a sentence, the court-martial may consider evidence tendingto show that an accused has little regard for the rights of others.Argument.After introduction of matters relating to sentence under this rule, counsel for the prosecution and defense may argue for an appropriate sentence.Trial counsel may not in argument purport to speak for the convening authorityor any higher authority, or refer to the views of such authorities or anypolicy directive relative to punishment or to any punishment or quantum ofpunishment greater than that court-martial may adjudge. Trial counsel may,however, recommend a specific lawful sentence and may also refer to generallyaccepted sentencing philosophies, including rehabilitation of the accused,general deterrence, specific deterrence of misconduct by the accused, andsocial retribution. Failure to object to improper argument before the militaryjudge begins to instruct the members on sentencing shall constitute waiverof the objection. Discussion A victim, victims' counsel, or designee has no right to present argument under this rule.Crime victims and presentencingIn general.A crime victim of an offense of which the accused has been found guilty has the right to be reasonably heard at a sentencing hearing relating to that offense. A victim under this rule is not considered a witness for purposes of Article 42(b). Trial counsel shall ensure the victim is aware of the opportunity to exercise that right. If the victim exercises the right to be reasonably heard, the victim shall be called by the court. This right is independent of whether the victim testified during findings or is called to testify under R.C.M. 1001.Definitions.Crime victim. For purposes of this rule, a "crime victim" is an individual who has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of an offense of which the accused was found guilty.Victim Impact. For the purposes of this rule, "victim impact" includes any financial, social, psychological, or medical impact on the victim directly relating to or arising from the offense of which the accused has been found guilty.Mitigation. For the purposes of this rule, "mitigation" includes a matter to lessen the punishment to be adjudged by the court-martial or to furnish grounds for a recommendation of clemency.Right to be reasonably heard.Capital cases. In capital cases, for purposes of this rule, the "right to be reasonably heard" means the right to make a sworn statement.Non-capital cases. In non-capital cases, for purposes of this rule, the "right to be reasonably heard" means the right to make a sworn or unsworn statement.Content of statement. The content of statements made under subsections (d) and (e) of this rule may include victim impact or matters in mitigation.Sworn statement. The victim may give a sworn statement under this rule and shall be subject to cross-examination concerning it by the trial counsel or defense counsel or examination on it by the court-martial, or all or any of the three. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the sworn statement may be made by the victim's designee appointed under R.C.M. 801(a)(6). Additionally, a victim under 18 years of age may elect to make a sworn statement.Unsworn statement. The victim may make an unsworn statement and may not be cross-examined by the trial counsel or defense counsel upon it or examined upon it by the court-martial. The prosecution or defense may, however, rebut any statements of facts therein. The unsworn statement may be oral, written, or both. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the unsworn statement may be made by the victim's designee appointed under R.C.M. 801(a)(6). Additionally, a victim under 18 years of age may elect to make an unsworn statement.Procedure for presenting unsworn statement. After the announcement of findings, a victim who would like to present an unsworn statement shall provide a copy to the trial counsel, defense counsel, and military judge. The military judge may waive this requirement for good cause shown.Discussion When the military judge waives the notice requirement under this rule, the military judge may conduct a session under Article 39(a) to ascertain the content of the victim's anticipated unsworn statement.Upon good cause shown, the military judge may permit the victim's counsel to deliver all or part of the victim's unsworn statement.Discussion If there are numerous victims, the military judge may reasonably limit the form of the statements provided.

 A victim's unsworn statement should not exceed what is permitted under R.C.M. 1001A(c) and may not include a recommendation of a specific sentence. Upon objection by either party or _sua sponte_, a military judge may stop or interrupt a victim's unsworn statement that includes matters outside the scope of R.C.M. 1001A(c). A victim, victim's counsel, or designee has no separate right to present argument under R.C.M. 1001(g).Sentence determinationSubject to limitations in this Manual, the sentence to be adjudgedis a matter within the discretion of the court-martial; except when a mandatoryminimum sentence is prescribed by the code, a court-martial may adjudgeany punishment authorized in this Manual, including the maximum punishmentor any lesser punishment, or may adjudge a sentence of no punishment.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning authorized punishmentsand limitations on punishments. _See also_ R.C.M. 1004 incapital cases.PunishmentsIn general.Subject to the limitations in this Manual, the punishments authorized in this rule may be adjudged in the case of any person found guilty of anoffense by a court-martial.Discussion"Any person" includes officers, enlisted persons, person in custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposed by a court-martial,and, insofar as the punishments are applicable, any other person subjectto the code. _See_ R.C.M. 202.Authorized punishments.Subject to the limitations in this Manual, a court-martial mayadjudge only the following punishments: Reprimand.A court-martial shall not specify the terms or wording of a reprimand.A reprimand, if approved, shall be issued, in writing, by the convening authority;DiscussionA reprimand adjudged by a court-martial is a punitive censure.Forfeiture of pay and allowances.Unless a total forfeiture is adjudged, a sentence to forfeitureshall state the exact amount in whole dollars to be forfeited each monthand the number of months the forfeitures will last. 

 Allowancesshall be subject to forfeiture only when the sentence includes forfeitureof all pay and allowances. The maximum authorized amount of a partial forfeitureshall be determined by using the basic pay, retired pay, or retainer pay,as applicable, or, in the case of reserve component personnel on inactive-duty,compensation for periods of inactive-duty training, authorized by the cumulativeyears of service of the accused, and, if no confinement is adjudged, anysea or hardship duty pay. If the sentence also includes reduction in grade,expressly or by operation of law, the maximum forfeiture shall be based onthe grade to which the accused is reduced.DiscussionA forfeiture deprives the accused of the amount of pay (and allowances)specified as it accrues. Forfeitures accrue to the United States. 

 Forfeituresof pay and allowances adjudged as part of a court-martial sentence, or occurring by operation of Article 58b are effective 14 days after the sentence isadjudged or when the sentence is approved by the convening authority, whicheveris earlier. 

 "Basic pay" does not include payfor special qualifications, such as diving pay, or incentive pay such asflying, parachuting, or duty on board a submarine. 

 Forfeitureof pay and allowances under Article 58b is not a part of the sentence, butis an administrative result thereof. 

 At general courts-martial,if both a punitive discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the operationof Article 58b results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances during thatperiod of confinement. If only confinement is adjudged, then if that confinement exceeds six months, the operation of Article 58b results in total forfeitureof pay and allowances during that period of confinement. If only a punitivedischarge is adjudged, Article 58b has no effect on pay and allowances.A death sentence results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances. 

 Ata special court-martial, if a bad-conduct discharge and confinement are adjudged,then the operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds ofpay only (not allowances) during that period of confinement. If only confinementis adjudged, and that confinement exceeds six months, then the operationof Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of pay only (not allowances)during the period of confinement. If only a bad conduct discharge is adjudged,Article 58b has no effect on pay. 

 If the sentence, as approvedby the convening authority or other competent authority, does not resultin forfeitures by the operation of Article 58b, then only adjudged forfeituresare effective. 

 Article 58b has no effect on summary courts-martial.Fine.Any court-martial may adjudge a fine in lieu of or in addition to forfeitures. In the case of a member of the armed forces, summary and special courts-martial may not adjudge any fine or combination of fine and forfeitures in excess of the total amount of forfeitures that may be adjudged in that case. In the case of a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, a summary court-martial may not adjudge a fine in excess of two-thirds of one month of the highest rate of enlisted pay, and a special court-martial may not adjudge a fine in excess of two-thirds of one year of the highest rate of officer pay. To enforce collection, a fine may be accompanied by a provision in the sentence that, in the event the fine is not paid, the person fined shall, in addition to any period of confinement adjudged, be further confined until a fixed period considered an equivalent punishment to the fine has expired. The total period of confinement so adjudged shall not exceed the jurisdictional limitations of the court-martial;DiscussionA fine is in the nature of a judgment and, when ordered executed, makes the accused immediately liable to the United States for the entire amount of money specified in the sentence. A fine normally should not be adjudged against a member of the armed forces unless the accused was unjustly enriched as a result of the offense of which convicted. In the case of a civilian subject to military law, a fine, rather than a forfeiture, is the proper monetary penalty to be adjudged, regardless of whether unjust enrichment is present.

 _See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(3) concerning imposition of confinement when theaccused fails to pay a fine. 

 Where the sentence adjudgedat a special court-martial includes a fine, see R.C.M. 1107(d)(5) for limitationson convening authority action on the sentence.Reduction in pay grade.Except as provided in R.C.M. 1301(d), a court-martial may sentencean enlisted member to be reduced to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade;DiscussionReduction under Article 58a is not a part of the sentence but isan administrative result thereof. Restriction to specified limits.Restriction may be adjudged for no more than 2 months for each month of authorized confinement and in no case for more than 2 months. Confinementand restriction may be adjudged in the same case, but they may not togetherexceed the maximum authorized period of confinement, calculating the equivalencyat the rate specified in this subsection;DiscussionRestriction does not exempt the person on whom it is imposed fromany military duty. Restriction and hard labor without confinement may beadjudged in the same case provided they do not exceed the maximum limits for each. _See_ subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii) of this rule. The sentence adjudged should specify the limits of the restriction.Hard labor without confinement.Hard labor without confinement may be adjudged for no more than1-1/2 months for each month of authorized confinement and in no case formore than three months. Hard labor without confinement may be adjudged only in the cases of enlisted members. The court-martial shall not specify thehard labor to be performed. Confinement and hard labor without confinementmay be adjudged in the same case, but they may not together exceed the maximumauthorized period of confinement, calculating the equivalency at the ratespecified in this subsection. DiscussionHard labor without confinement is performed in addition to other regular duties and does not excuse or relieve a person from performing regularduties. Ordinarily, the immediate commander of the accused will designate the amount and character of the labor to be performed. Upon completion ofthe daily assignment, the accused should be permitted to take leave or libertyto which entitled. 

 _See_ R.C.M. 1301(d) concerninglimitations on hard labor without confinement in summary courts-martial.Confinement.The place of confinement shall not be designated by the court-martial.When confinement for life is authorized, it may be with or without eligibilityfor parole. A court-martial shall not adjudge a sentence to solitary confinementor to confinement without hard labor;DiscussionThe authority executing a sentence to confinement may require hard labor whether or not the words "at hard labor" are includedin the sentence. _See_ Article 58(b). To promote uniformity,the words "at hard labor" should be omitted in a sentence toconfinement.Punitive separation.A court-martial may not adjudge an administrative separation fromthe service. There are three types of punitive separation. Dismissal.Dismissal applies only to commissioned officers, commissioned warrant officers, cadets, and midshipmen and may be adjudged only by a general court-martial.Regardless of the maximum punishment specified for an offense in Part IVof this Manual, a dismissal may be adjudged for any offense of which a commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, cadet, or midshipman has been found guilty; Dishonorable discharge.A dishonorable discharge applies only to enlisted persons and warrant officers who are not commissioned and may be adjudged only by a generalcourt-martial. Regardless of the maximum punishment specified for an offensein Part IV of this Manual, a dishonorable discharge may be adjudged for anyoffense of which a warrant officer who is not commissioned has been foundguilty. A dishonorable discharge should be reserved for those who shouldbe separated under conditions of dishonor, after having been convicted ofoffenses usually recognized in civilian jurisdictions as felonies, or ofoffenses of a military nature requiring severe punishment; andDiscussion _See also_ subsection (d)(1) of this rule regardingwhen a dishonorable discharge is authorized as an additional punishment. 

 _See_ Article 56a.Bad conduct discharge.A bad-conduct discharge applies only to enlisted persons and maybe adjudged by a general court-martial and by a special court-martial whichhas met the requirements of R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B). A bad-conduct dischargeis less severe than a dishonorable discharge and is designed as a punishmentfor bad-conduct rather than as a punishment for serious offenses of eithera civilian or military nature. It is also appropriate for an accused whohas been convicted repeatedly of minor offenses and whose punitive separation appears to be necessary;Discussion _See also_ subsections (d)(2) and (3) of this ruleregarding when a bad-conduct discharge is authorized as an additional punishment.Death.Death may be adjudged only in accordance with R.C.M. 1004; andPunishments under the law of war.In cases tried under the law of war, a general court-martial may adjudge any punishment not prohibited by the law of war. Limits on punishments.Based on offenses.Offenses listed in Part IV.Maximum punishment.The maximum limits for the authorized punishments of confinement, forfeitures and punitive discharge (if any) are set forth for each offenselisted in Part IV of this Manual. These limitations are for each separate offense, not for each charge. When a dishonorable discharge is authorized,a bad-conduct discharge is also authorized. Other punishments.Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Manual, the types of punishments listed in subsections (b)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7)of this rule may be adjudged in addition to or instead of confinement, forfeitures,a punitive discharge (if authorized), and death (if authorized). Offenses not listed Part IV.Included or related offenses.For an offense not listed in Part IV of this Manual which is included in or closely related to an offense listed therein the maximum punishmentshall be that of the offense listed; however if an offense not listed isincluded in a listed offense, and is closely related to another or is equallyclosely related to two or more listed offenses, the maximum punishment shallbe the same as the least severe of the listed offenses. Not included or related offenses.An offense not listed in Part IV and not included in or closely related to any offense listed therein is punishable as authorized by theUnited States Code, or as authorized by the custom of the service. When the United States Code provides for confinement for a specified period or notmore than a specified period the maximum punishment by court-martial shallinclude confinement for that period. If the period is 1 year or longer, the maximum punishment by court-martial also includes a dishonorable dischargeand forfeiture of all pay and allowances; if 6 months or more, a bad-conductdischarge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances; if less than 6 months, forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for the authorized period of confinement.Multiple Offenses.When the accused is found guilty of two or more offenses, the maximum authorized punishment may be imposed for each separate offense, unless the military judge finds that the offenses are either multiplicious or unreasonably multiplied.Multiplicity. A charge is multiplicious and must be dismissed if the proof of such charge also proves every element of another charged offense unless Congress intended to impose multiple punishments for the same act.Unreasonable Multiplication. If the military judge finds that there is an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to sentence, the maximum punishment for those offenses shall be the maximum authorized punishment for the offense carrying the greatest maximum punishment. The military judge may either merge the offenses for sentencing, or dismiss one or more of the charges.Discussion_See also_ R.C.M. 906(b)(12); 907(b)(3)(B).

 Even if charges are not multiplicious, a military judge may rule on a motion that the prosecutor abused his discretion under R.C.M. 307(c)(4) or a motion that an unreasonable multiplication of charges requires relief under R.C.M. 1003(b)(1). Rather than the "single impulse" test previously noted in this Discussion, "--LSQP--t--RSQP--he better approach is to allow the military judge, in his or her discretion, to merge the offenses for sentencing purposes..." by determining whether the Quiroz test is fulfilled._United States v. Campbell_, 71 M.J. 19 (C.A.A.F. 2012). (citing _United States v. Quiroz_, 55 M.J. 334, 338 (C.A.A.F. 2001).

 Multiplicity is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B). Unreasonable multiplication of charges is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12).Based on rank of accused.Commissioned or warrant officers, cadets, and midshipmen.A commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet, or midshipman maynot be reduced in grade by any court-martial. However, in time of war ornational emergency the Secretary concerned, or such Under Secretary or AssistantSecretary as may be designated by the Secretary concerned, may commute asentence of dismissal to reduction to any enlisted grade. Only a general court-martial may sentence a commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet, or midshipman to confinement. A commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet or midshipman may notbe sentenced to hard labor without confinement. Only a general court-martial, upon conviction of any offense in violation of the Code, may sentence a commissioned or warrant officer ora cadet or midshipman to be separated from the service with a punitive separation. In the case of commissioned officers, cadets, midshipmen, and commissioned warrant officers, the separation shall be by dismissal. In the case of allother warrant officers, the separation shall by dishonorable discharge.Enlisted persons. _See_ subsection (b)(9) of this rule and R.C.M.1301(d). Based on reserve status in certain circumstances.Restriction on liberty.A member of a reserve component whose order to active duty is approvedpursuant to Article 2(d)(5) may be required to serve any adjudged restrictionon liberty during that period of active duty. Other members of a reservecomponent ordered to active duty pursuant to Article 2(d)(1) or tried bysummary court-martial while on inactive duty training may not- by sentenced to confinement; or be required to serve a court-martial punishment consisting of any other restriction on liberty except during subsequent periods of inactive-dutytraining or active duty. Forfeiture.A sentence to forfeiture of pay of a member not retained on active duty after completion of disciplinary proceedings may be collected fromactive duty and inactive-duty training pay during subsequent periods of duty.DiscussionFor application of this subsection, _see_ R.C.M.204. At the conclusion of nonjudicial punishment proceedings or final adjournmentof the court-martial, the reserve component member who was ordered to activeduty for the purpose of conducting disciplinary proceedings should be releasedfrom active duty within one working day unless the order to active duty wasapproved by the Secretary concerned and confinement or other restrictionon liberty was adjudged. Unserved punishments may be carried over to subsequentperiods of inactive-duty training or active duty.Based on status as a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field.In the case of a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, no court-martial may adjudge forfeiture of pay and allowances, reduction in pay grade, hard labor without confinement, or a punitive separation.Based on other rules.The maximum limits on punishments in this rule may be further limited by other Rules of Courts-martial. DiscussionThe maximum punishment may be limited by: the jurisdictional limits of the court-martial (_see _ R.C.M. 201(f) and 1301(d)); thenature of the proceedings (_see_ R.C.M. 810(d) (sentencelimitations in rehearings, new trials, and other trials)); and by instructions by a convening authority (_see_ R.C.M. 601(e)(1)). _See also_ R.C.M. 1107(d)(4) concerning limits on the maximum punishmentwhich may be approved depending on the nature of the record.Circumstances permitting increased punishments.Three or more convictions.If an accused is found guilty of an offense or offenses for noneof which a dishonorable discharge is otherwise authorized, proof of threeor more previous convictions adjudged by a court-martial during the yearnext preceding the commission of any offense of which the accused standsconvicted shall authorize a dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of allpay and allowances and, if the confinement otherwise authorized is lessthan 1 year, confinement for 1 year. In computing the 1-year period precedingthe commission of any offense, periods of unauthorized absence shall be excluded.For purposes of this subsection, the court-martial convictions must be final.Two or more convictions.If an accused is found guilty of an offense or offenses for noneof which a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is otherwise authorized,proof of two or more previous convictions adjudged by a court-martial duringthe 3 years next preceding the commission of any offense of which the accusedstands convicted shall authorize a bad-conduct discharge and forfeiture ofall pay and allowances and, if the confinement otherwise authorized is lessthan 3 months, confinement for 3 months. In computing the 3 year period precedingthe commission of any offense, periods of unauthorized absence shall be excluded. For purposes of this subsection the court-martial convictions must be final.Two or more offenses.If an accused is found guilty of two or more offenses for none of which a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is otherwise authorized, thefact that the authorized confinement for these offenses totals 6 monthsor more shall, in addition, authorize a bad-conduct discharge and forfeitureof all pay and allowances. DiscussionAll of these increased punishments are subject to all other limitationson punishments set forth elsewhere in this rule. Convictions by summary court-martialmay not be used to increase the maximum punishment under this rule. Howeverthey may be admitted and considered under R.C.M. 1001.Capital casesIn general.Death may be adjudged only when: Death is expressly authorized under Part IV of this Manual for an offense of which the accused has been found guilty or is authorized underthe law of war for an offense of which the accused has been found guiltyunder the law of war; and The accused was convicted of such an offense by the concurrenceof all the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote wastaken; and The requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this rule have been met. Procedure.In addition to the provisions in R.C.M. 1001, the following proceduresshall apply in capital cases- Notice.Referral.The convening authority shall indicate that the case is to be tried as a capital case by including a special instruction in the referral block of the charge sheet. Failure to include this special instruction at the time of the referral shall not bar the convening authority from later adding the required special instruction, provided:that the convening authority has otherwise complied with the notice requirement of subsection (B); and that if the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure to include the special instruction, a continuance or a recess is an adequate remedy.Arraignment.Before arraignment, trial counsel shall give the defense written notice of which aggravating factors under subsection (c) of this rule theprosecution intends to prove. Failure to provide timely notice under this subsection of any aggravating factors under subsection (c) of this rule shall not bar later notice and proof of such additional aggravating factors unlessthe accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure and that acontinuance or a recess is not an adequate remedy.

Basis for findings.The findings in subsection (b)(4) of this rule may be based onevidence introduced before or after findings under R.C.M. 921, or both.Instructions.In addition to the instructions required under R.C.M. 1005, the military judge shall instruct the members of such aggravating factors undersubsection (c) of this rule as may be in issue in the case, and on the requirementsand procedures under subsections (b)(4), (5), (7), and (8) of this rule.The military judge shall instruct the members that they must consider allevidence in extenuation and mitigation before they may adjudge death. Voting.In closed session, before voting on a sentence, the members shall vote by secret written ballot separately on each aggravating factor undersubsection (c) of this rule on which they have been instructed. Death maynot be adjudged unless all members concur in a finding of the existence of at least one such aggravating factor. After voting on all the aggravatingfactors on which they have been instructed, the members shall vote on asentence in accordance with R.C.M. 1006. Announcement.If death is adjudged, the president shall, in addition to complying with R.C.M. 1007, announce which aggravating factors under subsection (c)of this rule were found by the members. Aggravating factors.Death may be adjudged only if the members find, beyond a reasonable doubt, one or more of the following aggravating factors: That the offense was committed before or in the presence of the enemy, except that this factor shall not apply in the case of a violationof Article 118 or 120;Discussion _See_ paragraph 23, Part IV, for a definition of"before or in the presence of the enemy."That in committing the offense the accused- Knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to the national security of the United States; or Knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to a mission, system, or function of the United States, provided that this subparagraphshall apply only if substantial damage to the national security of the UnitedStates would have resulted had the intended damage been effected; That the offense caused substantial damage to the national security of the United States, whether or not the accused intended such damage, exceptthat this factor shall not apply in case of a violation of Article 118 or120; That the offense was committed in such a way or under circumstances that the life of one or more persons other than the victim was unlawfullyand substantially endangered, except that this factor shall not apply toa violation of Articles 104, 106a, or 120; That the accused committed the offense with the intent to avoid hazardous duty; That, only in the case of a violation of Article 118 or 120, the offense was committed in time of war and in territory in which the UnitedStates or an ally of the United States was then an occupying power or inwhich the armed forces of the United States were then engaged in active hostilities;That, only in the case of a violation of Article 118(1): The accused was serving a sentence of confinement for 30 years or more or for life at the time of the murder; The murder was committed: while the accused was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of any robbery, rape, rape of a child, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, sexual abuse of a child, aggravated arson, forcible sodomy, burglary, kidnapping, mutiny, sedition, or piracy of an aircraft or vessel; or while the accused was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of any offense involving the wrongful distribution, manufacture, or introduction or possession, with intent to distribute, of a controlled substance; or, while the accused was engaged in flight or attempted flight after the commission or attempted commission of any such offense. The murder was committed for the purpose of receiving money or a thing of value; The accused procured another by means of compulsion, coercion, ora promise of an advantage, a service, or a thing of value to commit themurder; The murder was committed with the intent to avoid or to prevent lawful apprehension or effect an escape from custody or confinement; The victim was the President of the United States, the President-elect,the Vice President, or, if there was no Vice President, the officer in theorder of succession to the office of President of the United States, theVice-President-elect, or any individual who is acting as President underthe Constitution and laws of the United States, any Member of Congress (includinga Delegate to, or Resident Commissioner in, the Congress) or Member-of-Congresselect, justice or judge of the United States, a chief of state or head ofgovernment (or the political equivalent) of a foreign nation, or a foreignofficial (as such term is defined in section 1116(b)(3)(A) of title 18,United States Code), if the official was on official business at the timeof the offense and was in the United States or in a place described in Mil.R. Evid.315(c)(2), 315(c)(3); The accused then knew that the victim was any of the followingpersons in the execution of office: a commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned,or petty officer of the armed services of the United States; a member ofany law enforcement or security activity or agency, military or civilian,including correctional custody personnel; or any firefighter; The murder was committed with intent to obstruct justice; The murder was preceded by the intentional infliction of substantial physical harm or prolonged, substantial mental or physical pain and sufferingto the victim. For purposes of this section, "substantial physicalharm" means fractures or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn membersof the body, serious damage to internal organs, or other serious bodily injuries.The term "substantial physical harm" does not mean minor injuries,such as a black eye or bloody nose. The term "substantial mentalor physical pain or suffering" is accorded its common meaning and includestorture. The accused has been found guilty in the same case of another violationof Article 118; The victim of the murder was under 15 years of age. That only in the case of a violation of Article 118(4), the accused was the actual perpetrator of the killing or was a principal whose participation in the burglary, forcible sodomy, rape, rape of a child, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, sexual abuse of a child, robbery, or aggravated arson was major and who manifested a reckless indifference for human life.DiscussionConduct amounts to "reckless indifference" when itevinces a wanton disregard of consequences under circumstances involvinggrave danger to the life of another, although no harm is necessarily intended. The accused must have had actual knowledge of the grave danger to othersor knowledge of circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to realizethe highly dangerous character of such conduct. In determining whether participationin the offense was major, the accused's presence at the scene and the extentto which the accused aided, abetted, assisted, encouraged, or advised theother participants should be considered. _See United States v. Berg_, 31 M.J. 38 (C.M.A. 1990); _ United States v. McMonagle_ 38 M.J. 53 (C.M.A. 1993).That, in addition to the offense for which the accused is eligible for the death penalty, the accused has also been convicted of a sexual offense in which: Under Article 120b, the victim was under the age of 12; or Under Articles 120 or 120b, the accused maimed or attempted to kill the victim; That, only in the case of a violation of the law of war, death is authorized under the law of war for the offense; That, only in the case of a violation of Article 104 or 106a: The accused has been convicted of another offense involving espionage or treason for which either a sentence of death or imprisonment for lifewas authorized by statute; or That in committing the offense, the accused knowingly created agrave risk of death to a person other than the individual who was the victim. 

 Forpurposes of this rule, "national security" means the nationaldefense and foreign relations of the United States and specifically includes:a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations;a favorable foreign relations position; or a defense posture capable of successfullyresisting hostile or destructive action from within or without.DiscussionExamples of substantial damage of the national security of the United States include: impeding the performance of a combat mission or operation;impeding the performance of an important mission in a hostile fire or imminentdanger pay area (_see_ 37 U.S.C. --SECT-- 310(a)); and disclosingmilitary plans, capabilities, or intelligence such as to jeopardize any combatmission or operation of the armed services of the United States or its alliesor to materially aid an enemy of the United States.Spying.If the accused has been found guilty of spying under Article 106, subsections (a)(2), (b), and (c) of this rule and R.C.M. 1006 and 1007 shallnot apply. Sentencing proceedings in accordance with R.C.M. 1001 shall beconducted, but the military judge shall announce that by operation of lawa sentence of death has been adjudged. Other penalties.Except for a violation of Article 106, when death is an authorized punishment for an offense, all other punishments authorized under R.C.M.1003 are also authorized for that offense, including confinement for life, with or without eligibility for parole, and may be adjudged in lieu of the death penalty, subject to limitations specifically prescribed in this Manual.A sentence of death includes a dishonorable discharge or dismissal as appropriate.Confinement is a necessary incident of a sentence of death, but not a partof it.DiscussionA sentence of death may not be ordered executed until approved bythe President. _See_ R.C.M. 1207. A sentence to death whichhas been finally ordered executed will be carried out in the manner prescribedby the Secretary concerned. _See_ R.C.M. 1113(e)(1).Instructions on sentenceIn general.The military judge shall give the members appropriate instructionson sentence.DiscussionInstructions should be tailored to the facts and circumstances ofthe individual case.When given.Instructions on sentence shall be given after arguments by counsel and before the members close to deliberate on sentence, but the militaryjudge may, upon request of the members, any party, or _sua sponte_, give additional instructions at a later time. Requests for instructions.After presentation of matters relating to sentence or at such other time as the military judge may permit, any party may request that the militaryjudge instruct the members on the law as set forth in the request. The militaryjudge may require the requested instruction to be written. Each party shall be given the opportunity to be heard on any proposed instruction on sentence before it is given. The military judge shall inform the parties of the proposedaction on such requests before their closing arguments on sentence.DiscussionRequests for and objections to instructions should be resolved atan Article 39(a) session. _But see_ R.C.M. 801(e)(1)(C); 803. 

 Themilitary judge is not required to give the specific instruction requestedby counsel if the matter is adequately covered in the instructions. 

 Themilitary judge should not identify the source of any instruction when addressingthe members. 

 All written requests for instructions shouldbe marked as appellate exhibits, whether or not they are given.How given.Instructions on sentence shall be given orally on the record inthe presence of all parties and the members. Written copies of the instructions,or unless a party objects, portions of them, may also be given to the membersfor their use during deliberations.DiscussionA copy of any written instructions delivered to the members shouldbe marked as an appellate exhibit.Required instructions.Instructions on sentence shall include: A statement of the maximum authorized punishment that may be adjudged and of the mandatory minimum punishment, if any;DiscussionThe maximum punishment that may be adjudged is the lowest of the total permitted by the applicable paragraph(s) in Part IV for each separate offense of which the accused was convicted (_see also_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning additional limits on punishments and additional punishments which may be adjudged) or the jurisdictional limit of the court-martial (_see_ R.C.M. 201(f) and R.C.M. 1301(d)). _See also_ Discussion to R.C.M. 810(d). The military judge may upon request or when otherwise appropriate instruct on lesser punishments. _See_ R.C.M. 1003. If an additional punishment is authorized under R.C.M. 1003(d), the members must be informed of the basis for the increased punishment.

 A carefully drafted sentence worksheet ordinarily should be used and should include reference to all authorized punishments in the case.A statement of the effect any sentence announced including a punitive discharge and confinement, or confinement in excess of six months, willhave on the accused's entitlement to pay and allowances; A statement of the procedures for deliberation and voting on the sentence set out in R.C.M. 1006;Discussion _See also_ R.C.M. 1004 concerning additional instructions required in capital cases. A statement informing the members that they are solely responsible for selecting an appropriate sentence and may not rely on the possibilityof any mitigating action by the convening or higher authority; andDiscussion _See also_ R.C.M. 1002.A statement that the members should consider all matters in extenuation,mitigation, and aggravation, whether introduced before or after findings,and matters introduced under R.C.M. 1001(b)(1), (2), (3) and (5). DiscussionFor example, tailored instructions on sentencing should bring attentionto the reputation or record of the accused in the service for good conduct,efficiency, fidelity, courage, bravery, or other traits of good character,and any pretrial restraint imposed on the accused.Waiver.Failure to object to an instruction or to omission of an instruction before the members close to deliberate on the sentence constitutes waiverof the objection in the absence of plain error. The military judge may requirethe party objecting to specify in what respect the instructions were improper.The parties shall be given the opportunity to be heard on any objection outsidethe presence of the members. Deliberations and voting on sentenceIn general.The members shall deliberate and vote after the military judgeinstructs the members on sentence. Only the members shall be present duringdeliberations and voting. Superiority in rank shall not be used in any mannerto control the independence of members in the exercise of their judgment.Deliberations.Deliberations may properly include full and free discussion of the sentence to be imposed in the case. Unless otherwise directed by the militaryjudge, members may take with them in deliberations their notes, if any,any exhibits admitted in evidence, and any written instructions. Membersmay request that the court-martial be reopened and that portions of the recordbe read to them or additional evidence introduced. The military judge may,in the exercise of discretion, grant such requests. Proposal of sentences.Any member may propose a sentence. Each proposal shall be in writing and shall contain the complete sentence proposed. The junior member shallcollect the proposed sentences and submit them to the president.DiscussionA proposal should state completely each kind and, where appropriate, amount of authorized punishment proposed by that member. For example, aproposal of confinement for life would state whether it is with or withouteligibility for parole. _See_ R.C.M.1003(b).Voting.Duty of members.Each member has the duty to vote for a proper sentence for theoffenses of which the court-martial found the accused guilty, regardlessof the member's vote or opinion as to the guilt of the accused. Secret ballot. Proposed sentences shall be voted on by secret written ballot.Procedure.Order.All members shall vote on each proposed sentence in its entirety beginning with the least severe and continuing, as necessary, with the nextleast severe, until a sentence is adopted by the concurrence of the numberof members required under subsection (d)(4) of this rule. The process ofproposing sentences and voting on them may be repeated as necessary untila sentence is adopted. Counting votes. The junior member shall collect the ballots and count the votes.The president shall check the count and inform the other members of theresult.DiscussionA sentence adopted by the required number of members may be reconsideredonly in accordance with R.C.M. 1009.Number of votes required.Death.A sentence which includes death may be adjudged only if all members present vote for that sentence.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 1004.Confinement for life, with or without eligibility for parole, or more than 10 years.A sentence that includes confinement for life, with or withouteligibility for parole, or more than 10 years may be adjudged only if atleast three-fourths of the members present vote for that sentence. Other.A sentence other than those described in subsection (d)(4)(A) or(B) of this rule may be adjudged only if at least two-thirds of the memberspresent vote for that sentence.DiscussionIn computing the number of votes required to adopt a sentence, any fraction of a vote is rounded up to the next whole number. For example,if there are seven members, at least six would have to concur to impose a sentence requiring a three-fourths vote, while at least five would have to concur to impose a sentence requiring a two-thirds vote.Mandatory sentence.When a mandatory minimum is prescribed under Article 118 the members shall vote on a sentence in accordance with this rule. Effect of failure to agree.If the required number of members do not agree on a sentence aftera reasonable effort to do so, a mistrial may be declared as to the sentenceand the case shall be returned to the convening authority, who may ordera rehearing on sentence only or order that a sentence of no punishment beimposed. Action after a sentence is reached.After the members have agreed upon a sentence, the court-martial shall be opened and the president shall inform the military judge that asentence has been reached. The military judge may, in the presence of theparties, examine any writing which the president intends to read to announcethe sentence and may assist the members in putting the sentence in properform. Neither that writing nor any oral or written clarification or discussionconcerning it shall constitute announcement of the sentence.DiscussionOrdinarily a sentence worksheet should be provided to the membersas an aid to putting the sentence in proper form. _See_ Appendix11 for a format for forms of sentences. If a sentence worksheet has beenprovided, the military judge should examine it before the president announces the sentence. If the military judge intends to instruct the members aftersuch examination, counsel should be permitted to examine the worksheet andto be heard on any instructions the military judge may give. 

 Thepresident should not disclose any specific number of votes for or againstany sentence. 

 If the sentence is ambiguous or apparentlyillegal, _ see_ R.C.M. 1009.Announcement of sentenceIn general.The sentence shall be announced by the president or, in a court-martialcomposed of a military judge alone, by the military judge, in the presenceof all parties promptly after it has been determined.Discussion _See_ Appendix 11. 

 An elementof a sentence adjudged by members about which no instructions were givenand which is not listed on a sentence worksheet is not proper.Erroneous announcement.If the announced sentence is not the one actually determined bythe court-martial, the error may be corrected by a new announcement madebefore the record of trial is authenticated and forwarded to the conveningauthority. This action shall not constitute reconsideration of the sentence.If the court-martial has been adjourned before the error is discovered,the military judge may call the court-martial into session to correct theannouncement.DiscussionFor procedures governing reconsideration of the sentence, _ see_ R.C.M. 1009. _See also_ R.C.M. 1102 concerningthe action to be taken if the error in the announcement is discovered afterthe record is authenticated and forwarded to the convening authority.Polling prohibited.Except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 606, members may not otherwisebe questioned about their deliberations and voting. Impeachment of sentenceA sentence which is proper on its face may be impeached only when extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the attentionof a member, outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member,or unlawful command influence was brought to bear upon any member.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 923 Discussion concerning impeachmentof findings.Reconsideration of sentenceReconsideration.Subject to this rule, a sentence may be reconsidered at any time before such sentence is announced in open session of the court.Exceptions.If the sentence announced in open session was less than the mandatory minimum prescribed for an offense of which the accused has been found guilty,the court that announced the sentence may reconsider such sentence uponreconsideration in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule. If the sentence announced in open session exceeds the maximum permissiblepunishment for the offense or the jurisdictional limitation of the court-martial,the sentence may be reconsidered after announcement in accordance with subsection(e) of this rule. Clarification of sentence.A sentence may be clarified at any time prior to action of theconvening authority on the case. Sentence adjudged by the military judge.When a sentence adjudged by the military judge is ambiguous, the military judge shall call a session for clarification as soon as practicalafter the ambiguity is discovered. Sentence adjudged by members.When a sentence adjudged by members is ambiguous, the military judge shall bring the matter to the attention of the members if the matter isdiscovered before the court-martial is adjourned. If the matter is discovered after adjournment, the military judge may call a session for clarificationby the members who adjudged the sentence as soon as practical after the ambiguity is discovered. Action by the convening authority.When a sentence adjudged by the court-martial is ambiguous, the convening authority may return the matter to the court-martial for clarification. When a sentence adjudged by the court-martial is apparently illegal, theconvening authority may return the matter to the court-martial for reconsiderationor may approve a sentence no more severe than the legal, unambiguous portionsof the adjudged sentence. Reconsideration procedure.Any member of the court-martial may propose that a sentence reached by the members be reconsidered. Instructions.When a sentence has been reached by members and reconsiderationhas been initiated, the military judge shall instruct the members on theprocedure for reconsideration. Voting.The members shall vote by secret written ballot in closed session whether to reconsider a sentence already reached by them. Number of votes required.With a view to increasing.Subject to subsection (b) of this rule, members may reconsider a sentence with a view of increasing it only if at least a majority vote forreconsideration.With a view to decreasing.Members may reconsider a sentence with a view to decreasing it only if: In the case of a sentence which includes death, at least one member votes to reconsider; In the case of a sentence which includes confinement for life, with or without eligibility for parole, or more than 10 years, more than one-fourthof the members vote to reconsider; or; In the case of any other sentence, more than one-third of the members vote to reconsider.DiscussionAfter a sentence has been adopted by secret ballot vote in closed session, no other vote may be taken on the sentence unless a vote to reconsidersucceeds. 

 For example, if six of nine (two-thirds) membersadopt a sentence, a vote of at least five would be necessary to reconsiderto increase it; four would have to vote to reconsider in order to decreaseit. If seven of nine (three-fourths) members is required to adopt a sentence,a vote of at least five would be necessary to reconsider to increase it,while three would be necessary to reconsider to decrease it.Successful vote.If a vote to reconsider a sentence succeeds, the procedures in R.C.M. 1006 shall apply. Notice concerning post-trial and appellate rightsIn each general and special court-martial, prior to adjournment,the military judge shall ensure that the defense counsel has informed theaccused orally and in writing of: The right to submit matters to the convening authority to consider before taking action; The right to appellate review, as applicable, and the effect of waiver or withdrawal of such right; The right to apply for relief from the Judge Advocate General ifthe case is neither reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals nor reviewedby the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1); and The right to the advice and assistance of counsel in the exerciseof the foregoing rights or any decision to waive them. 

 The writtenadvice to the accused concerning post-trial and appellate rights shall besigned by the accused and the defense counsel and inserted in the recordof trial as an appellate exhibit.DiscussionThe post-trial duties of the defense counsel concerning the appellate rights of the accused are set forth in paragraph (E)(iv) of the Discussionaccompanying R.C.M. 502(d)(6). The defense counsel shall explain the appellaterights to the accused and prepare the written document of such advisementprior to or during trial.AdjournmentThe military judge may adjourn the court-martial at the end of the trial of an accused or proceed to trial of other cases referred to thatcourt-martial. Such an adjournment may be for a definite or indefinite period.DiscussionA court-martial and its personnel have certain powers and responsibilitiesfollowing the trial. _See_, for example, R.C.M. 502(d)(5) Discussion(F); 502(d)(6) Discussion (E); 808; 1007; 1009; Chapter XI.POST-TRIAL PROCEDUREReport of result of trial; post-trial restraint; deferment of confinement, forfeitures and reduction in grade; waiver of Article 58b forfeituresReport of the result of trial.After final adjournment of the court-martial in a case, the trial counsel shall promptly notify the accused's immediate commander, the conveningauthority or the convening authority's designee, and, if appropriate, theofficer in charge of the confinement facility of the findings and sentence.Post-trial confinement.In general.An accused may be placed in post-trial confinement if the sentence adjudged by the court-martial includes death or confinement. Who may order confinement.Unless limited by superior authority, a commander of the accusedmay order the accused into post-trial confinement when post-trial confinementis authorized under subsection (b)(1) of this rule. A commander authorized to order post-trial confinement under this subsection may delegate thisauthority to the trial counsel.DiscussionThe commander may release the accused, order confinement, or order other appropriate restraint. Regardless whether the accused is ordered intoconfinement, a sentence to confinement begins to run on the date it is adjudgedunless it is deferred under subsection (c) of this rule. _See_ Article57.Confinement on other grounds.Nothing in this rule shall prohibit confinement of a person aftera court-martial on proper grounds other than the offenses for which theaccused was tried at the court-martial.Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 304, 305, and paragraph 5b(2), PartV, for other grounds for confinement. Deferment of confinement, forfeitures or reduction in grade.In general.Deferment of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reductionin grade is a postponement of the running of the sentence.DiscussionDeferment is not suspension of the sentence or a form of clemency.Who may defer.The convening authority or, if the accused is no longer in theconvening authority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martialjurisdiction over the command to which the accused is assigned, may, uponwritten application of the accused, at any time after the adjournment ofthe court-martial, defer the accused's service of a sentence to confinement,forfeitures, or reduction in grade that has not been ordered executed.Action on deferment request.The authority acting on the deferment request may, in that authority'sdiscretion, defer service of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reductionin grade. The accused shall have the burden of showing that the interestsof the accused and the community in deferral outweigh the community's interestsin imposition of the punishment on its effective date. Factors that the authorityacting on a deferment request may consider in determining whether to grantthe deferment request include, where applicable: the probability of the accused's flight; the probability of the accused's commission of other offenses,intimidation of witnesses, or interference with the administration of justice;the nature of the offenses (including the effect on the victim) of whichthe accused was convicted; the sentence adjudged; the command's immediateneed for the accused; the effect of deferment on good order and disciplinein the command; the accused's character, mental condition, family situation,and service record. The decision of the authority acting on the deferment request shall be subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion.The action of the authority acting on the deferment request shall be inwriting and a copy shall be provided to the accused.DiscussionThe deferment request and the action on the request must be attached to the record of trial. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(D). If therequest for deferment is denied, the basis for the denial should be in writingand attached to the record of trial.Orders.The action granting deferment shall be reported in the convening authority's action under R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E) and shall include the dateof the action on the request when it occurs prior to or concurrently withthe action. Action granting deferment after the convening authority's actionunder R.C.M. 1107 shall be reported in orders under R.C.M. 1114 and includedin the record of trial. Restraint when deferment is granted.When deferment of confinement is granted, no form of restraint or other limitation on the accused's liberty may be ordered as a substituteform of punishment. An accused may, however, be restricted to specifiedlimits or conditions may be placed on the accused's liberty during the period of deferment for any other proper reason, including a ground for restraintunder R.C.M. 304. End of deferment.Deferment of a sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reductionin grade ends when: The convening authority takes action under R.C.M. 1107, unless the convening authority specifies in the action that service of confinementafter the action is deferred; The confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade are suspended;The deferment expires by its own terms; or The deferment is otherwise rescinded in accordance with subsection (c)(7) of this rule. Deferment of confinement may not continue after theconviction is final under R.C.M. 1209.DiscussionWhen the sentence is ordered executed, forfeitures or reductionin grade may be suspended, but may not be deferred; deferral of confinementmay continue after action in accordance with R.C.M. 1107. A form of punishmentcannot be both deferred and suspended at the same time. When deferment ofconfinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade ends, the sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade begins to run or resumes running, asappropriate. When the convening authority has specified in the action thatconfinement will be deferred after the action, the deferment may not be terminated,except under subsections (6)(B), (C), or (D), until the conviction is finalunder R.C.M. 1209. 

 See R.C.M. 1203 for deferment of a sentenceto confinement pending review under Article 67(a)(2). Rescission of deferment.Who may rescind.The authority who granted the deferment or, if the accused is no longer within that authority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising generalcourt-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is assigned,may rescind the deferment. Action.Deferment of confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade maybe rescinded when additional information is presented to a proper authoritywhich, when considered with all other information in the case, that authorityfinds, in that authority's discretion, is grounds for denial of defermentunder subsection (c)(3) of this rule. The accused shall promptly be informedof the basis for the rescission and of the right to submit written mattersin the accused's behalf and to request that the rescission be reconsidered. However, the accused may be required to serve the sentence to confinement, forfeitures, or reduction in grade pending this action. Execution.When deferment of confinement is rescinded after the conveningauthority's action under R.C.M. 1107, the confinement may be ordered executed.However, no such order to rescind a deferment of confinement may be issuedwithin 7 days of notice of the rescission of a deferment of confinement tothe accused under subsection (c)(7)(B) of this rule, to afford the accusedan opportunity to respond. The authority rescinding the deferment may extendthis period for good cause shown. The accused shall be credited with anyconfinement actually served during this period. Orders.Rescission of a deferment before or concurrently with the initial action in the case shall be reported in the action under R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E),which action shall include the dates of the granting of the deferment andthe rescission. Rescission of a deferment of confinement after the conveningauthority's action shall be reported in supplementary orders in accordancewith R.C.M. 1114 and shall state whether the approved period of confinement is to be executed or whether all or part of it is to be suspended.Discussion _See_ Appendix 16 for forms.Waiving forfeitures resulting from a sentence to confinement to provide for dependent support.With respect to forfeiture of pay and allowances resulting onlyby operation of law and not adjudged by the court, the convening authoritymay waive, for a period not to exceed six months, all or part of the forfeituresfor the purpose of providing support to the accused's dependent(s). Theconvening authority may waive and direct payment of any such forfeitureswhen they become effective by operation of Article 57(a). Factors that may be considered by the convening authority in determiningthe amount of forfeitures, if any, to be waived include, but are not limitedto, the length of the accused's confinement, the number and age(s) of theaccused's family members, whether the accused requested waiver, any debtsowed by the accused, the ability of the accused's family members to findemployment, and the availability of transitional compensation for abuseddependents permitted under 10 U.S.C. 1059. For the purposes of this Rule, a "dependent" means any person qualifying as a "dependent" under 37 U.S.C. 401.DiscussionForfeitures resulting by operation of law, rather than those adjudged as part of a sentence, may be waived for six months or for the durationof the period of confinement, whichever is less. The waived forfeituresare paid as support to dependent(s) designated by the convening authority. When directing waiver and payment, the convening authority should identifyby name the dependent(s) to whom the payments will be made and state thenumber of months for which the waiver and payment shall apply. In caseswhere the amount to be waived and paid is less than the jurisdictional limitof the court, the monthly dollar amount of the waiver and payment shouldbe stated.Post-trial sessionsIn general.Post-trial sessions may be proceedings in revision or Article 39(a) sessions. Such sessions may be directed by the military judge or the conveningauthority in accordance with this rule. Purpose.Proceedings in revision.Proceedings in revision may be directed to correct an apparent error, omission, or improper or inconsistent action by the court-martial, whichcan be rectified by reopening the proceedings without material prejudiceto the accused.DiscussionBecause the action at a proceeding in revision is corrective, a proceeding in revision may not be conducted for the purpose of presentingadditional evidence. 

 Examples when a proceeding in revisionis appropriate include: correction of an ambiguous or apparently illegalaction by the court-martial; inquiry into the terms of a pretrial agreement;and inquiry to establish the accused's awareness of certain rights. 

 _See also_ R.C.M. 1104(d) concerning correction of the record by certificate of correction.Article 39(a) sessions.An Article 39(a) session under this rule may be called, upon motion of either party or _sua sponte_ by the military judge, for the purpose of inquiring into, and, when appropriate, resolving any matter that arises after trial and that substantially affects the legal sufficiency of any findings of guilty or the sentence. The military judge may also call an Article 39(a) session, upon motion of either party or sua sponte, to reconsider any trial ruling that substantially affects the legal sufficiency of any findings of guilty or the sentence. The military judge may, _sua sponte_, at any time prior to authentication of the record of trial, enter a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses charged, or may enter a finding of not guilty of a part of a specification as long as a lesser offense charged is alleged in the remaining portion of the specification. Prior to entering such a finding or findings, the military judge shall give each party an opportunity to be heard on the matter in a post-trial Article 39(a) session.DiscussionFor example, an Article 39(a) session may be called to permit a military judge to reconsider a trial ruling, or to examine allegations ofmisconduct by a counsel, a member, or a witness. _See_ R.C.M. 917(d) forthe standard to be used to determine the legal sufficiency of evidence.Matters not subject to post-trial sessions.Post-trial session may not be directed: For reconsideration of a finding of not guilty of any specification, or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not guilty; For reconsideration of a finding of not guilty of any charge, unless the record shows a finding of guilty under a specification laid under thatcharge, which sufficiently alleges a violation of some article of the code;or For increasing the severity of the sentence unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. When directed.The military judge may direct a post-trial session any time before the record is authenticated. The convening authority may direct a post-trialsession any time before the convening authority takes initial action onthe case or at such later time as the convening authority is authorized todo so by a reviewing authority. Procedure.Personnel.The requirements of R.C.M. 505 and 805 shall apply at post-trial sessions except that- For a proceeding in revision, if trial was before members and the matter subject to the proceeding in revision requires the presence of members:The absence of any members does not invalidate the proceedings if,in the case of a general court-martial, at least five members are present,or, in the case of a special court-martial, at least three members are present;and A different military judge may be detailed, subject to R.C.M. 502(c) and 902, if the military judge who presided at the earlier proceedings isnot reasonably available. For an Article 39(a) session, a different military judge may be detailed, subject to R.C.M. 502(c) and 902, for good cause. Action.The military judge shall take such action as may be appropriate, including appropriate instructions when members are present. The membersmay deliberate in closed session, if necessary, to determine what correctiveaction, if any, to take. Prior to the military judge _sua sponte_ entering a finding of not guilty of one or more offenses charged or entering a finding of not guilty of a part of a specification as long as a lesser offense charged is alleged in the remaining portion of the specification, the military judge shall give each party an opportunity to be heard on the matter.Record.All post-trial sessions, except any deliberations by the members, shall be held in open session. The record of the post-trial sessions shallbe prepared, authenticated, and served in accordance with R.C.M. 1103 and1104 and shall be included in the record of the prior proceedings.

With respect to any other offense, the accusedhas the burden of such proof by a preponderance of the evidence. If, after the hearing, the military judge finds the accused has satisfied the standard specified in subsection (3) of this section, themilitary judge shall inform the general court-martial convening authority of this result and the accused shall be released. If, however, the military judge finds after the hearing that the accused has not satisfied the standardspecified in subsection (3) of this section, then the military judge shallinform the general court-martial convening authority of this result and thatauthority may commit the accused to the custody of the Attorney General.Preparation of record of trialIn general.Each general, special, and summary court-martial shall keep a separaterecord of the proceedings in each case brought before it.

 Substituteauthentication is authorized only in emergencies. A brief, temporary absenceof the military judge from the situs of the preparation of the record oftrial does not justify a substitute authentication. Prolonged absence, includingpermanent change of station, ordinarily justifies substitute authentication. 

 Theperson who authenticates the record of trial instead of the military judgeshould attach to the record of trial an explanation for the substitute authentication. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3) (E).Summary courts-martial.The summary court-martial shall authenticate the summary court-martialrecord of trial as prescribed in R.C.M. 1305(a).

A statement shall be attached to the record explaining why the accused was not served personally. If the accused was found guilty of any offense that resulted in direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm to a victim or victims, a separate copy of the recommendation will be served on that victim or those victims. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, deceased, or otherwise unavailable, service shall be made on one of the following (in order of precedence): the victim's attorney, spouse, legal guardian, parent, child, sibling, or similarly situated family member. For a victim that is an institutional entity, service shall be made on an authorized representative of the entity.DiscussionThe method of service and the form of the proof of service are not prescribed and may be by any appropriate means. _See_ R.C.M.1103(b)(3)(G). For example, a certificate of service, attached to the recordof trial, would be appropriate when the accused is served personally.Counsel for the accused.The accused may, at trial or in writing to the staff judge advocate or legal officer before the recommendation has been served under this rule,designate which counsel (detailed, individual military, or civilian) willbe served with the recommendation. In the absence of such designation, thestaff judge advocate or legal officer shall cause the recommendation to beserved in the following order of precedence, as applicable, on: (1) civiliancounsel; (2) individual military counsel; or (3) detailed defense counsel.If the accused has not retained civilian counsel and the detailed defensecounsel and individual military counsel, if any, have been relieved or arenot reasonably available to represent the accused, substitute military counselto represent the accused shall be detailed by an appropriate authority. Substitutecounsel shall enter into an attorney-client relationship with the accusedbefore examining the recommendation and preparing any response.DiscussionWhen the accused is represented by more than one counsel, the militaryjudge should inquire of the accused and counsel before the end of the court-martialas to who will act for the accused under this rule.Record of trial.The staff judge advocate or legal officer shall, upon request of counsel for the accused served with the recommendation, provide that counselwith a copy of the record of trial for use while preparing the responseto the recommendation. Response.Counsel for the accused may submit, in writing, corrections or rebuttal to any matter in the recommendation and its enclosures believed to be erroneous, inadequate, or misleading, and may comment on any other matter.Discussion _See also_ R.C.M. 1105.Time period.Counsel for the accused shall be given 10 days from service of the record of trial under R.C.M. 1104(b) or receipt of the recommendation, whicheveris later, in which to submit comments on the recommendation.

"New matter" does not ordinarily include any discussion by the staff judge advocate or legal officer of the correctness of the initial defense comments on the recommendation. The method of service and the form of the proof of service are not prescribed and may be by any appropriate means. _See_ R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(G). For example, a certificate of service, attached to the record of trial, would be appropriate when the accused is served personally.

The convening authority who convenedthe court-martial may take action on the case regardless whether the accusedis a member of or present in the convening authority's command. 

 Itwould be impracticable for the convening authority to take initial actionwhen, for example, a command has been decommissioned or inactivated beforethe convening authority's action; when a command has been alerted for immediateoverseas movement; or when the convening authority is disqualified because the convening authority has other than an official interest in the case or because a member of the court-martial which tried the accused later becamethe convening authority. 

 If the convening authority forwardsthe case to an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction forinitial review and action, the record should include a statement of the reasonswhy the convening authority did not act.General considerations.Discretion of convening authority.Any action to be taken on the findings and sentence is within the sole discretion of the convening authority. The convening authority is not required to review the case for legal errors or factual sufficiency.DiscussionThe action is taken in the interests of justice, discipline, mission requirements, clemency, and other appropriate reasons. If errors are noticedby the convening authority, the convening authority may take correctiveaction under this rule.When action may be taken.The convening authority may take action only after the applicable time periods under R.C.M. 1105(c) have expired or the accused has waivedthe right to present matters under R.C.M. 1105(d), whichever is earlier,subject to regulations of the Secretary concerned. Matters considered.Required matters.Before taking action, the convening authority shall consider: The result of trial;Discussion _See_ R.C.M. 1101(a).The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officerunder R.C.M. 1106, if applicable; and Any matters submitted by the accused under R.C.M. 1105 or, if applicable, R.C.M. 1106(f);Any statement submitted by a crime victim pursuant to R.C.M. 1105A and subsection (C) below.Additional matters.Before taking action the convening authority may consider: The record of trial, subject to the provisions of R.C.M. 1103A and subsection (C) below;The personnel records of the accused; and Such other matters as the convening authority deems appropriate. However, if the convening authority considers matters adverse to the accusedfrom outside the record, with knowledge of which the accused is not chargeable,the accused shall be notified and given an opportunity to rebut. Prohibited matters.The convening authority shall not consider any matters that relate to the character of a victim unless such matters were presented as evidence at trial and not excluded at trial.When proceedings resulted in finding of not guilty or not guilty onlyby reason of lack of mental responsibility, or there was a ruling amountingto a finding of not guilty.The convening authority shall not take action disapproving a finding of not guilty, a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mentalresponsibility, or a ruling amounting to a finding of not guilty. When anaccused is found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility,the convening authority, however, shall commit the accused to a suitablefacility pending a hearing and disposition in accordance with R.C.M. 1102A.DiscussionCommitment of the accused to the custody of the Attorney Generalfor hospitalization is discretionary.Action when accused lacks mental capacity.The convening authority may not approve a sentence while the accused lacks mental capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligentlyin the post-trial proceedings. In the absence of substantial evidence tothe contrary, the accused is presumed to have the capacity to understandand to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the post-trial proceedings.If a substantial question is raised as to the requisite mental capacityof the accused, the convening authority may direct an examination of theaccused in accordance with R.C.M. 706 before deciding whether the accusedlacks mental capacity, but the examination may be limited to determining the accused's present capacity to understand and cooperate in the post-trial proceedings. The convening authority may approve the sentence unless itis established, by a preponderance of the evidence-including mattersoutside the record of trial-that the accused does not have the requisitemental capacity. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the conveningauthority from disapproving the findings of guilty and sentence. Action on findings.Action on the findings is not required. However, the convening authority may take action subject to the following limitations:For offenses charged under subsection (a) or (b) of Article 120; offenses charged under Article 120b; and offenses charged under Article 125.The convening authority is prohibited from:Setting aside any finding of guilt or dismissing a specification; orChanging a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification.The convening authority may direct a rehearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule.For offenses other than those listed in subsection (c)(1) for which the maximum sentence of confinement that may be adjudged does not exceed two years without regard to the jurisdictional limits of the court; and the sentence adjudged does not include dismissal, a dishonorable discharge, bad-conduct discharge, or confinement for more than six months: The convening authority may change a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification; orSet aside any finding of guilty and:Dismiss the specification and, if appropriate, the charge; orDirect a rehearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule.If the convening authority acts to dismiss or change any charge or specification for an offense, the convening authority shall provide, at the same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.Action on the sentence.In general.The convening authority may not disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, any portion of an adjudged sentence of confinement for more than six months.The convening authority may not disapprove, commute, or suspend that portion of an adjudged sentence that includes a dismissal, dishonorable discharge, or bad-conduct discharge.The convening authority may disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, any portion of an adjudged sentence not explicitly prohibited by this rule, to include reduction in pay grade, forfeitures of pay and allowances, fines, reprimands, restrictions, and hard labor without confinement.The convening authority shall not disapprove, commute, or suspend any mandatory minimum sentence of dismissal or dishonorable discharge except in accordance with subsection (E) below. Exceptions. Trial counsel recommendation. Upon the recommendation of the trial counsel, in recognition of the substantial assistance by the accused in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section shall have the authority to disapprove, commute, or suspend the adjudged sentence, in whole or in part, even with respect to an offense for which a mandatory minimum sentence exists.Discussion The phrase "investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense" includes offenses under the UCMJ or other Federal, State, local, or foreign criminal statutes.Pretrial agreement. If a pretrial agreement has been entered into by the convening authority and the accused as authorized by R.C.M. 705, the convening authority shall have the authority to approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend a sentence, in whole or in part, pursuant to the terms of the pretrial agreement. The convening authority may commute a mandatory sentence of a dishonorable discharge to a bad-conduct discharge pursuant to the terms of the pretrial agreement. If the convening authority acts to disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, the sentence of the court-martial for an offense, the convening authority shall provide, at the same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.Discussion A sentence adjudged by a court-martial may be approved if it was within the jurisdiction of the court-martial to adjudge (_see_ R.C.M.201(f)) and did not exceed the maximum limits prescribed in Part IV and Chapter X of this Part for the offense(s) of which the accused legally has been found guilty.

 When mitigating forfeitures, the duration and amounts of forfeiture may be changed as long as the total amount forfeited is not increased and neither the amount nor duration of the forfeitures exceeds the jurisdiction of the court-martial. When mitigating confinement or hard labor without confinement, the convening authority should use the equivalencies atR.C.M. 1003(b)(5)-(6), as appropriate.

 Unless prohibited by this rule, the convening authority may disapprove, mitigate or change to a less severe punishment any individual component of a sentence. For example, if an accused is found guilty of assault consummated by a battery and sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, three months of confinement, and reduction to E-1, without a pre-trial agreement and without being able to apply the substantial assistance exception, the convening authority may disapprove or reduce any part of the sentence except the bad-conduct discharge.Determining what sentence should be approved. The convening authority shall, subject to the limitations in subsection (d)(1) above, approve that sentence which is warranted by the circumstances of the offense and appropriate for the accused.Discussion In determining what sentence should be approved, the convening authority should consider all relevant and permissible factors including the possibility of rehabilitation, the deterrent effect of the sentence, and all matters relating to clemency, such as pretrial confinement. _See also_ R.C.M. 1001- 1004.

 When an accused is not serving confinement, the accused should not be deprived of more than two-thirds pay for any month as a result of one or more sentences by court-martial and other stoppages or involuntary deductions, unless requested by the accused. Since court-martial forfeitures constitute a loss of entitlement of the pay concerned, they take precedence over all debts.Deferring service of a sentence to confinement.In a case in which a court-martial sentences an accused referredto in subsection (B), below, to confinement, the convening authority maydefer service of a sentence to confinement by a court-martial, without theconsent of the accused, until after the accused has been permanently releasedto the armed forces by a state or foreign country. Subsection (A) applies to an accused who, while in custody of astate or foreign country, is temporarily returned by that state or foreigncountry to the armed forces for trial by court-martial; and after the court-martial,is returned to that state or foreign country under the authority of a mutual agreement or treaty, as the case may be. As used in subsection (d)(3), the term "state" meansa state of the United States, the District of Columbia, a territory, anda possession of the United States.DiscussionThe convening authority's decision to postpone service of a court-martialsentence to confinement normally should be reflected in the action.Limitations on sentence based on record of trial.If the record of trial does not meet the requirements of R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(B) or (c)(1), the convening authority may not approve a sentencein excess of that which may be adjudged by a special court-martial, or onethat includes a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months,forfeiture of pay exceeding two-thirds pay per month, or any forfeiture ofpay for more than six months.Discussion _See also_ R.C.M. 1103(f).Limitations on sentence of a special court-martial where a fine hasbeen adjudged.A convening authority may not approve in its entirety a sentence adjudged at a special court-martial when, if approved, the cumulative impactof the fine and forfeitures, whether adjudged or by operation of Article58b, would exceed the jurisdictional maximum dollar amount of forfeituresthat may be adjudged at that court-martial. Ordering rehearing or other trial.Rehearing.In general.Subject to subsections (e)(1)(B) through (e)(1)(E) of this rule,the convening authority may in the convening authority's discretion ordera rehearing. A rehearing may be ordered as to some or all offenses of which findings of guilty were entered and the sentence, or as to sentence only.DiscussionA rehearing may be appropriate when an error substantially affecting the findings or sentence is noticed by the convening authority. The severityof the findings or the sentence of the original court-martial may not be increased at a rehearing unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. _See_ R.C.M. 810(d). If the accused is placedunder restraint pending a rehearing, _ see_ R.C.M. 304; 305.When the convening authority may order a rehearing.The convening authority may order a rehearing: When taking action on the court-martial under this rule; In cases subject to review by the Court of Criminal Appeals, before the case is forwarded under R.C.M. 1111(a)(1) or (b)(1), but only as to any sentence which was approved or findings of guilty as we not disapproved in any earlier action. In cases of rehearing under paragraph (c)(2), a supplemental action disapproving the sentence and some or all of the findings , as appropriate, shall be taken; orWhen authorized to do so by superior competent authority.If the convening authority finds a rehearing as to any offenses impracticable, the convening authority may dismiss those specificationsand, when appropriate, charges.DiscussionA sentence rehearing, rather than a reassessment, may be more appropriatein cases where a significant part of the government's case has been dismissed. The convening authority may not take any actions inconsistent with directivesof superior competent authority. Where that directive is unclear, appropriateclarification should be sought from the authority issuing the original directive.Sentence reassessment.If a superior authority has approved some of the findings of guiltyand has authorized a rehearing as to other offenses and the sentence, theconvening authority may, unless otherwise directed, reassess the sentencebased on the approved findings of guilty and dismiss the remaining charges. Reassessment is appropriate only where the convening authority determinesthat the accused's sentence would have been at least of a certain magnitudehad the prejudicial error not been committed and the reassessed sentence isappropriate in relation to the affirmed findings of guilty.Limitations.Sentence approved.A rehearing shall not be ordered if, in the same action, a sentence is approved. Rehearing on sentence only.A rehearing on sentence only shall not be referred to a different kind of court-martial from that which made the original findings. If theconvening authority determines a rehearing on sentence is impracticable, the convening authority may approve a sentence of no punishment withoutconducting a rehearing. Additional charges.Additional charges may be referred for trial together with chargesas to which a rehearing has been directed. Lesser included offenses.If at a previous trial the accused was convicted of a lesser included offense, a rehearing may be ordered only as to that included offense oras to an offense included in that found. If, however, a rehearing is orderedimproperly on the original offense charged and the accused is convicted ofthat offense at the rehearing, the finding as to the lesser included offenseof which the accused was convicted at the original trial may neverthelessbe approved.

The convening authority may also recall and modify any action at any time prior to forwarding the record for review, as long as the modification does not result in action less favorable to the accused than the earlier action. In addition, in any special court-martial, the convening authority may recall and correct an illegal, erroneous, incomplete, or ambiguous action at any time before completion of review under R.C.M. 1112, as long as the correction does not result in action less favorable to the accused than the earlier action. When so directed by a higher reviewing authority or the Judge Advocate General, the convening authority shall modify any incomplete, ambiguous, void, or inaccurate action noted in review of the record of trial under Articles 64, 66, 67, or examination of the record of trial under Article 69. The convening authority shall personally sign any supplementary or corrective action. A written explanation is required for any modification of initial action which: 1) sets aside any finding of guilt or dismisses or changes any charge or specification for an offense; or 2) disapproves, commutes, or suspends, in whole or in part, the sentence. The written explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.DiscussionFor purposes of this rule, a record is considered to have beenforwarded for review when the convening authority has either delivered itin person or has entrusted it for delivery to a third party over whom the convening authority exercises no lawful control (_e.g._, the United States Postal Service).Findings of guilty.If any findings of guilty are disapproved, the action shall so state. If a rehearing is not ordered, the affected charges and specifications shallbe dismissed by the convening authority in the action. If a rehearing orother trial is directed, the reasons for the disapproval shall be set forth in the action.DiscussionIf a rehearing or other trial is not directed, the reasons fordisapproval need not be stated in the action, but they may be when appropriate.It may be appropriate to state them when the reasons may affect administrativedisposition of the accused; for example, when the finding is disapprovedbecause of the lack of mental responsibility of the accused or the runningof the statute of limitations. 

 No express action is necessaryto approve findings of guilty. _See_ subsection (c) of thisrule.Action on sentence.In general.The action shall state whether the sentence adjudged by the court-martialis approved. If only part of the sentence is approved, the action shall statewhich parts are approved. A rehearing may not be directed if any sentenceis approved.Discussion _See_ Appendix 16 for forms.

The convening authoritymay approve a sentence adjudged upon a rehearing or other trial regardlesswhether any kind or amount of the punishment adjudged at the former trialhas been served or executed. However, in computing the term or amount of punishmentto be actually served or executed under the new sentence, the accused shallbe credited with any kind or amount of the former sentence included withinthe new sentence that was served or executed before the time it was disapprovedor set aside. The convening authority shall, if any part of a sentence adjudgedupon a rehearing or other trial is approved, direct in the action that anypart or amount of the former sentence served or executed between the dateit was adjudged and the date it was disapproved or set aside shall be credited to the accused. If, in the action on the record of a rehearing, the convening authority disapproves the findings of guilty of all charges and specificationswhich were tried at the former hearing and that part of the sentence whichwas based on these findings, the convening authority shall, unless a further rehearing is ordered, provide in the action that all rights, privileges,and property affected by any executed portion of the sentence adjudged atthe former hearing shall be restored.

When the action of the convening authority or of a higher authority is incomplete or ambiguous or contains error, the authority who took the incomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous action may be instructed by an authority acting under Articles 64, 66, 67, 67a, or 69 to withdraw the original action and substitute a corrected action.Service on accused.A copy of the convening authority's action shall be served on the accused or on defense counsel. If the action is served on defense counsel, defense counsel shall, by expeditious means, provide the accused with acopy.DiscussionIf the promulgating order is prepared promptly, service of it will satisfy subsection (h).Suspension of execution of sentence; remissionIn general.Suspension of a sentence grants the accused a probationary period during which the suspended part of an approved sentence is not executed,and upon the accused's successful completion of which the suspended partof the sentence shall be remitted.

The commander of the accused who has the authority to convene a court-martial of the kind that adjudged the sentence may suspend or remit any part of the unexecuted part of any sentence by summary court-martial or of any sentence by special court-martial that does not include a bad-conduct discharge regardless of whether the person acting has previously approved the sentence. The "unexecuted part of any sentence" is that part that has been approved and ordered executed but that has not actually been carried out.Discussion_See_ R.C.M. 1113 (execution of sentences); R.C.M. 1201 (action by the Judge Advocate General); R.C.M. 1206 (powers and responsibilitiesof the Secretary).

Restriction; hard labor without confinement.When restriction and hard labor without confinement are includedin the same sentence, they shall, unless one is suspended, be executed concurrently.More than one sentence.If at the time forfeitures may be ordered executed, the accusedis already serving a sentence to forfeitures by another court-martial, theauthority taking action may order that the later forfeitures will be executedwhen the earlier sentence to forfeitures is completed.

Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned asummary court-martial shall be of the same armed force as the accused. Summary courts-martial shall be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the military service to which the accused belongs. Whenever practicable, a summary court-martial should be an officer whose grade isnot below lieutenant of the Navy or Coast Guard or captain of the Army,Air Force, or Marine Corps. When only one commissioned officer is present with a command or detachment, that officer shall be the summary court-martial of that command or detachment. When more than one commissioned officer ispresent with a command or detachment, the convening authority may not bethe summary court-martial of that command or detachment. Function.The function of the summary court-martial is to promptly adjudicate minor offenses under a simple procedure. The summary court-martial shallthoroughly and impartially inquire into both sides of the matter and shallensure that the interests of both the Government and the accused are safeguardedand that justice is done. A summary court-martial may seek advice from ajudge advocate or legal officer on questions of law, but the summary court-martialmay not seek advice from any person on factual conclusions which should bedrawn from evidence or the sentence which should be imposed, as the summary court-martial has the independent duty to make these determinations.DiscussionFor a definition of "minor offenses," _see_paragraph 1e, Part V.Jurisdiction.**--LSQP--Note: R.C.M. 1301(c) applies to offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014.--RSQP--**Subject to Chapter II, summary courts-martial have the power totry persons subject to the code, except commissioned officers, warrant officers,cadets, aviation cadets, and midshipmen, for any noncapital offense madepunishable by the code.Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1) above, summary courts-martial do not have jurisdiction over offenses under Articles 120(a), 120(b), 120b(a), 120b(b), forcible sodomy under Article 125, and attempts thereof under Article 80, UCMJ.

 A summary court-martialmay not suspend all or part of a sentence, although the summary court-martialmay recommend to the convening authority that all or part of a sentence besuspended. If a sentence includes both reduction in grade and forfeitures,the maximum forfeiture is calculated at the reduced pay grade. _Seealso_ R.C.M. 1003 concerning other punishments which may be adjudged,the effects of certain types of punishment, and combination of certain typesof punishment. The summary court-martial should ascertain the effect ofArticle 58a in that armed force.Limitations-pay grade.In the case of enlisted members above the fourth enlisted pay grade, summary courts-martial may not adjudge confinement, hard labor without confinement,or reduction except to the next pay grade.DiscussionThe provisions of this subsection apply to an accused in the fifth enlisted pay grade who is reduced to the fourth enlisted pay grade by thesummary court-martial.Counsel.The accused at a summary court-martial does not have the right to counsel. If the accused has civilian counsel provided by the accused andqualified under R.C.M. 502(d)(3), that counsel shall be permitted to representthe accused at the summary court-martial if such appearance will not unreasonablydelay the proceedings and if military exigencies do not preclude it.DiscussionNeither the Constitution nor any statute establishes any right to counsel at summary courts-martial. Therefore, it is not error to deny anaccused the opportunity to be represented by counsel at a summary court-martial.However, appearance of counsel is not prohibited.
