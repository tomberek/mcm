PUNITIVE ARTICLES

(Statutory text of each Article is in bold)Discussion--LSQP--Note: To state an offense under Article 134, practitioners should expressly allege at least one of the three terminal elements, i.e., that the alleged conduct was: prejudicial to good order and discipline; service discrediting; or a crime or offense not capital. _See United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012). _See also_ paragraph 60c(6)(a) in this part and R.C.M. 307(c)(3).--RSQP--

 --LSQP--Note: In 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces examined Article 79 and clarified the legal test for lesser included offenses. _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). An offense under Article 79 is "necessarily included" in the offense charged only if the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the greater offense alleged. _See_ discussion following paragraph 3b(1)(c) in this part and the related analysis in Appendix 23 of this Manual.--RSQP--

 Part IV of the Manual addresses the punitive articles, 10 U.S.C. --SECT----SECT-- 877-934. Part IV is organized by paragraph beginning with Article 77; therefore, each paragraph number is associated with an article. For example, paragraph 45 addresses Article 120, Rape and sexual assault generally. Article 77, Principals, and Article 79, Lesser included offenses, are located in the punitive article subchapter of Title 10 but are not chargeable offenses as such.

 Other than Articles 77 and 79, the punitive articles of the code are discussed using the following sequence:Text of the article Elements of the offense or offenses Explanation Lesser included offenses Maximum punishment Sample specifications  Lesser included offenses are established in subparagraph d of each paragraph of Part IV and are defined and explained under Article 79. Practitioners are advised, however, to read and comply with _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). _See_ note above.

 Sample specifications are provided in subparagraph f of each paragraph in Part IV and are meant to serve as a guide. The specifications may be varied in form and content as necessary. R.C.M. 307 prescribes rules for preferral of charges and for drafting specifications. The discussion under that rule explains how to allege violations under the code using the format of charge and specification; however, practitioners are advised to read and comply with _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011) and _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). _See_ two notes above and R.C.M. 307(c)(3).

 The term "elements," as used in Part IV, includes both the statutory elements of the offense and any aggravating factors listed under the President's authority which increases the maximum permissible punishment when specified aggravating factors are pleaded and proven.

 The prescriptions of maximum punishments in subparagraph e of each paragraph of Part IV must be read in conjunction with R.C.M. 1003, which prescribes additional punishments that may be available and additional limitations on punishments.Article 77-PrincipalsText of statute.

 **Any person punishable under this chapter who-****commits an offense punishable by this chapter, or aids, abets,counsels, commands, or procures its commission; or****causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him wouldbe punishable by this chapter; is a principal.**Explanation.Purpose.Article 77 does not define an offense. Its purpose is to make clear that a person need not personally perform the acts necessary to constitutean offense to be guilty of it. A person who aids, abets, counsels, commands,or procures the commission of an offense, or who causes an act to be donewhich, if done by that person directly, would be an offense is equally guiltyof the offense as one who commits it directly, and may be punished to thesame extent. 

 Article 77 eliminates the common law distinctionsbetween principal in the first degree ("perpetrator"); principalin the second degree (one who aids, counsels, commands, or encourages thecommission of an offense and who is present at the scene of the crime-commonlyknown as an "aider and abettor"); and accessory before the fact(one who aids, counsels, commands, or encourages the commission of an offenseand who is not present at the scene of the crime). All of these are now "principals."Who may be liable for an offense.Perpetrator.A perpetrator is one who actually commits the offense, either bythe perpetrator's own hand, or by causing an offense to be committed byknowingly or intentionally inducing or setting in motion acts by an animateor inanimate agency or instrumentality which result in the commission ofan offense. For example, a person who knowingly conceals contraband drugsin an automobile, and then induces another person, who is unaware and hasno reason to know of the presence of drugs, to drive the automobile ontoa military installation, is, although not present in the automobile, guiltyof wrongful introduction of drugs onto a military installation. (On thesefacts, the driver would be guilty of no crime.) Similarly, if, upon ordersof a superior, a soldier shot a person who appeared to the soldier to bean enemy, but was known to the superior as a friend, the superior wouldbe guilty of murder (but the soldier would be guilty of no offense). Other Parties. If one is not a perpetrator, to be guilty of an offense committedby the perpetrator, the person must: Assist, encourage, advise, instigate, counsel, command, or procure another to commit, or assist, encourage, advise, counsel, or command anotherin the commission of the offense; and Share in the criminal purpose or design. 

 One who,without knowledge of the criminal venture or plan, unwittingly encouragesor renders assistance to another in the commission of an offense is not guiltyof a crime. _See_ the parentheticals in the examples in paragraph1b(2)(a) above. In some circumstances, inaction may make one liable as aparty, where there is a duty to act. If a person (for example, a securityguard) has a duty to interfere in the commission of an offense, but doesnot interfere, that person is a party to the crime _if_ sucha noninterference is intended to and does operate as an aid or encouragementto the actual perpetrator. Presence.Not necessary.Presence at the scene of the crime is not necessary to make onea party to the crime and liable as a principal. For example, one who, knowingthat a person intends to shoot another person and intending that such an assaultbe carried out, provides the person with a pistol, is guilty of assault whenthe offense is committed, even though not present at the scene. Not sufficient.Mere presence at the scene of a crime does not make one a principal unless the requirements of paragraph 1b(2)(a) or (b) have been met. Parties whose intent differs from the perpetrator's.When an offense charged requires proof of a specific intent orparticular state of mind as an element, the evidence must prove that theaccused had that intent or state of mind, whether the accused is chargedas a perpetrator or an "other party" to crime. It is possiblefor a party to have a state of mind more or less culpable than the perpetratorof the offense. In such a case, the party may be guilty of a more or lessserious offense than that committed by the perpetrator. For example, whena homicide is committed, the perpetrator may act in the heat of sudden passioncaused by adequate provocation and be guilty of manslaughter, while theparty who, without such passion, hands the perpetrator a weapon and encourages the perpetrator to kill the victim, would be guilty of murder. On the other hand, if a party assists a perpetrator in an assault on a person who, knownonly to the perpetrator, is an officer, the party would be guilty only ofassault, while the perpetrator would be guilty of assault on an officer.Responsibility for other crimes.A principal may be convicted of crimes committed by another principal if such crimes are likely to result as a natural and probable consequenceof the criminal venture or design. For example, the accused who is a partyto a burglary is guilty as a principal not only of the offense of burglary,but also, if the perpetrator kills an occupant in the course of the burglary,of murder. (_See also_ paragraph 5 concerning liability foroffenses committed by co-conspirators.) Principals independently liable.One may be a principal, even if the perpetrator is not identifiedor prosecuted, or is acquitted. Withdrawal.A person may withdraw from a common venture or design and avoid liability for any offenses committed after the withdrawal. To be effective,the withdrawal must meet the following requirements: It must occur before the offense is committed; The assistance, encouragement, advice, instigation, counsel, command, or procurement given by the person must be effectively countermanded ornegated; and The withdrawal must be clearly communicated to the would-be perpetratorsor to appropriate law enforcement authorities in time for the perpetratorsto abandon the plan or for law enforcement authorities to prevent the offense.Article 78-Accessory after the factText of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, knowing that anoffense punishable by this chapter has been committed, receives, comforts,or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial, or punishment shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.** Elements.That an offense punishable by the code was committed by a certain person; That the accused knew that this person had committed such offense;That thereafter the accused received, comforted, or assisted the offender; and That the accused did so for the purpose of hindering or preventing the apprehension, trial, or punishment of the offender. Explanation.In general.The assistance given a principal by an accessory after the factis not limited to assistance designed to effect the escape or concealmentof the principal, but also includes acts performed to conceal the commission of the offense by the principal (for example, by concealing evidence of the offense). Failure to report offense.The mere failure to report a known offense will not make one an accessory after the fact. Such failure may violate a general order or regulation,however, and thus constitute an offense under Article 92. _See_ paragraph16. If the offense involved is a serious offense, failure to report it may constitute the offense of misprision of a serious offense, under Article134. _See_ paragraph 95. Offense punishable by the code.The term "offense punishable by this chapter" in thetext of the article means any offense described in the code. Status of principal.The principal who committed the offense in question need not be subject to the code, but the offense committed must be punishable by thecode. Conviction or acquittal of principal.The prosecution must prove that a principal committed the offenseto which the accused is allegedly an accessory after the fact. However,evidence of the conviction or acquittal of the principal in a separate trialis not admissible to show that the principal did or did not commit the offense.Furthermore, an accused may be convicted as an accessory after the fact despitethe acquittal in a separate trial of the principal whom the accused allegedlycomforted, received, or assisted. Accessory after the fact not a lesser included offense.The offense of being an accessory after the fact is not a lesser included offense of the primary offense. Actual knowledge.Actual knowledge is required but may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Any person subject to the code who is found guilty as an accessory after the fact to an offense punishable by the code shall be subject tothe maximum punishment authorized for the principal offense, except thatin no case shall the death penalty nor more than one-half of the maximumconfinement authorized for that offense be adjudged, nor shall the periodof confinement exceed 10 years in any case, including offenses for whichlife imprisonment may be adjudged.

Article 79-Conviction of lesser included offensesText of statute.

 **An accused may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit either the offensecharged or an offense necessarily included therein.** Explanation.In general.A lesser offense is "necessarily included" in a charged offense when the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the charged offense, thereby putting the accused on notice to defend against the lesser offense in addition to the offense specifically charged. A lesser offense may be "necessarily included" when:All of the elements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, and the common elements are identical (for example, larceny as a lesser included offense of robbery);All of the elements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, but at least one element is a subset by being legally less serious (for example, housebreaking as a lesser included offense of burglary); orAll of the elements of the lesser offense are "included and necessary" parts of the greater offense, but the mental element is a subset by being legally less serious (for example, wrongful appropriation as a lesser included offense of larceny).DiscussionThe "elements test" is the proper method for determining lesser included offenses. _See United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010); _Schmuck v. United States_, 489 U.S. 705 (1989); Appendix 23 of this Manual, Art. 79. Paragraph 3.b.(1) was amended to comport with the elements test, which requires that the elements of the lesser offense must be a subset of the elements of the charged offense. The elements test does not require identical statutory language, and use of normal principles of statutory interpretation is permitted. The elements test is necessary to safeguard the due process requirement of notice to a criminal defendant.Sua sponte duty.A military judge must instruct panel members on lesser included offenses reasonably raised by the evidence. Multiple lesser included offenses.When the offense charged is a compound offense comprising two or more lesser included offenses, an accused may be found guilty of any or all of the offenses included in the offense charged. For example, robbery includes both larceny and assault. Therefore, in a proper case, a court-martial may find an accused not guilty of robbery, but guilty of wrongful appropriation and assault.Findings of guilty to a lesser included offense.A court-martial may find an accused not guilty of the offense charged, but guilty of a lesser included offense by the process of exception and substitution. The court-martial may except (that is, delete) the words in the specification that pertain to the offense charged and, if necessary, substitute language appropriate to the lesser included offense. For example, the accused is charged with murder in violation of Article 118, but found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in violation of Article 119. Such a finding may be worded as follows:

 Of the Specification: Guilty, except the word "murder" substituting therefor the words "willfully and unlawfully kill," of the excepted word, not guilty, of the substituted words, guilty.

 Of the Charge: Not guilty, but guilty of a violation of Article 119.

 If a court-martial finds an accused guilty of a lesser included offense, the finding as to the charge shall state a violation of the specific punitive article violated and not a violation of Article 79.Specific lesser included offenses.Specific lesser included offenses, if any, are listed for each offense in Appendix 12A, but the list is merely guidance to practitioners, is not all-inclusive, and is not binding on military courts.Discussion Practitioners must consider lesser included offenses on a case-by-case basis. _See United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010); United States v. Alston, 69 M.J. 214 (C.A.A.F. 2010); discussion following paragraph 3.b.(1)(c) above. The lesser included offenses listed in Appendix 12A were amended in 2015 to comport with the elements test; however, practitioners must analyze each lesser included offense on a case-by-case basis. _See_ Appendix 23 of this Manual, Art. 79.Article 80-AttemptsText of statute.**An act, done with specific intent to commit an offense under this chapter, amounting to more than mere preparation and tending, even though failing, to effect its commission, is an attempt to commit that offense.****Any person subject to this chapter who attempts to commit any offense punishable by this chapter shall be punished as a court-martial may direct, unless otherwise specifically prescribed.****Any person subject to this chapter may be convicted of an attemptto commit an offense although it appears on the trial that the offense was consummated.**Elements.That the accused did a certain overt act;That the act was done with the specific intent to commit a certain offense under the code; That the act amounted to more than mere preparation; and That the act apparently tended to effect the commission of theintended offense. Explanation.In general.To constitute an attempt there must be a specific intent to commit the offense accompanied by an overt act which directly tends to accomplishthe unlawful purpose. More than preparation.Preparation consists of devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the offense. The overt act required goesbeyond preparatory steps and is a direct movement toward the commissionof the offense. For example, a purchase of matches with the intent to burna haystack is not an attempt to commit arson, but it is an attempt to commitarson to applying a burning match to a haystack, even if no fire results.The overt act need not be the last act essential to the consummation of theoffense. For example, an accused could commit an overt act, and then voluntarilydecide not to go through with the intended offense. An attempt would neverthelesshave been committed, for the combination of a specific intent to commitan offense, plus the commission of an overt act directly tending to accomplishit, constitutes the offense of attempt. Failure to complete the offense,whatever the cause, is not a defense. Factual impossibility.A person who purposely engages in conduct which would constitutethe offense if the attendant circumstances were as that person believedthem to be is guilty of an attempt. For example, if A, without justificationor excuse and with intent to kill B, points a gun at B and pulls the trigger,A is guilty of attempt to murder, even though, unknown to A, the gun is defectiveand will not fire. Similarly, a person who reaches into the pocket of anotherwith the intent to steal that person's billfold is guilty of an attemptto commit larceny, even though the pocket is empty. Voluntary abandonment.It is a defense to an attempt offense that the person voluntarilyand completely abandoned the intended crime, solely because of the person'sown sense that it was wrong, prior to the completion of the crime. Thevoluntary abandonment defense is not allowed if the abandonment results,in whole or in part, from other reasons, for example, the person feared detectionor apprehension, decided to await a better opportunity for success, wasunable to complete the crime, or encountered unanticipated difficulties or unexpected resistance. A person who is entitled to the defense of voluntary abandonment may nonetheless be guilty of a lesser included, completed offense. For example, a person who voluntarily abandoned an attempted armed robberymay nonetheless be guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon. Solicitation. Soliciting another to commit an offense does not constitute an attempt. _See_ paragraph 6 for a discussion of Article 82,solicitation. Attempts not under Article 80. While most attempts should be charged under Article 80, the following attempts are specifically addressed by some other article, and should becharged accordingly: Article 85-desertion Article 94-mutiny or sedition. Article 100-subordinate compelling Article 104-aiding the enemy Article 106a-espionage Article 119a-attempting to kill an unborn childArticle 128-assault Regulations.An attempt to commit conduct which would violate a lawful general order or regulation under Article 92 (_see_ paragraph 16)should be charged under Article 80. It is not necessary in such cases toprove that the accused intended to violate the order or regulation, but itmust be proved that the accused intended to commit the prohibited conduct.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Any person subject to the code who is found guilty of an attempt under Article 80 to commit any offense punishable by the code shall be subjectto the same maximum punishment authorized for the commission of the offenseattempted, except that in no case shall the death penalty be adjudged, norshall any mandatory minimum punishment provisions apply; and in no case,other than attempted murder, shall confinement exceeding 20 years be adjudged.Sample specification. 

 In that  (personal jurisdiction data) did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data,if required), on or about  20 , attempt to (describe offense with sufficient detail to include expresslyor by necessary implication every element). Article 81-ConspiracyText of statute.

 (a) Any person subject to this chapter who conspires with any other person to commit an offense under this chapter shall, if one or more of the conspirators does an act to effect the object of the conspiracy, be punished as a court-martial may direct.

 (b) Any person subject to this chapter who conspires with any other person to commit an offense under the law of war, and who knowingly does an overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy, shall be punished, if death results to one or more of the victims, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial or military commission may direct, and, if death does not result to any of the victims, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial or military commission may direct.Elements.Conspiracy.That the accused entered into an agreement with one or more persons to commit an offense under the UCMJ; and That, while the agreement continued to exist, and while the accused remained a party to the agreement, the accused or at least one of the co-conspirators performed an overt act for the purpose of bringing about the object of the conspiracy.Conspiracy when offense is an offense under the law of war resulting in the death of one or more victims.That the accused entered into an agreement with one or more persons to commit an offense under the law of war;That, while the agreement continued to exist, and while the accused remained a party to the agreement, the accused knowingly performed an overt act for the purpose of bringing about the object of the conspiracy; andThat death resulted to one or more victims.Explanation.Co-conspirators.Two or more persons are required in order to have a conspiracy. Knowledge of the identity of co-conspirators and their particular connectionwith the criminal purpose need not be established. The accused must be subjectto the code, but the other co-conspirators need not be. A person may be guiltyof conspiracy although incapable of committing the intended offense. Forexample, a bedridden conspirator may knowingly furnish the car to be usedin a robbery. The joining of another conspirator after the conspiracy hasbeen established does not create a new conspiracy or affect the status ofthe other conspirators. However, the conspirator who joined an existingconspiracy can be convicted of this offense only if, at or after the timeof joining the conspiracy, an overt act in furtherance of the object of theagreement is committed. Agreement.The agreement in a conspiracy need not be in any particular formor manifested in any formal words. It is sufficient if the minds of theparties arrive at a common understanding to accomplish the object of theconspiracy, and this may be shown by the conduct of the parties. The agreementneed not state the means by which the conspiracy is to be accomplished orwhat part each conspirator is to play. Object of the agreement.The object of the agreement must, at least in part, involve the commission of one or more offenses under the code. An agreement to commitseveral offenses is ordinarily but a single conspiracy. Some offenses requiretwo or more culpable actors acting in concert. There can be no conspiracywhere the agreement exists only between the persons necessary to commit suchan offense. Examples include dueling, bigamy, incest, adultery, and bribery.Overt act.The overt act must be independent of the agreement to commit the offense; must take place at the time of or after the agreement; must bedone by one or more of the conspirators, but not necessarily the accused; and must be done to effectuate the object of the agreement. The overt act need not be in itself criminal, but it must be amanifestation that the agreement is being executed. Although committing theintended offense may constitute the overt act, it is not essential thatthe object offense be committed. Any overt act is enough, no matter how preliminaryor preparatory in nature, as long as it is a manifestation that the agreementis being executed. An overt act by one conspirator becomes the act of all without any new agreement specifically directed to that act and each conspirator isequally guilty even though each does not participate in, or have knowledge of, all of the details of the execution of the conspiracy. Liability for offenses.Each conspirator is liable for all offenses committed pursuant tothe conspiracy by any of the co-conspirators while the conspiracy continuesand the person remains a party to it. Withdrawal.A party to the conspiracy who abandons or withdraws from the agreementto commit the offense before the commission of an overt act by any conspiratoris not guilty of conspiracy. An effective withdrawal or abandonment mustconsist of affirmative conduct which is wholly inconsistent with adherenceto the unlawful agreement and which shows that the party has severed allconnection with the conspiracy. A conspirator who effectively abandons orwithdraws from the conspiracy after the performance of an overt act by oneof the conspirators remains guilty of conspiracy and of any offenses committed pursuant to the conspiracy up to the time of the abandonment or withdrawal.However, a person who has abandoned or withdrawn from the conspiracy isnot liable for offenses committed thereafter by the remaining conspirators. The withdrawal of a conspirator from the conspiracy does not affect thestatus of the remaining members. Factual impossibility.It is not a defense that the means adopted by the conspirators to achieve their object, if apparently adapted to that end, were actually notcapable of success, or that the conspirators were not physically able to accomplish their intended object. Conspiracy as a separate offense.A conspiracy to commit an offense is a separate and distinct offense from the offense which is the object of the conspiracy, and both the conspiracyand the consummated offense which was its object may be charged, tried,and punished. The commission of the intended offense may also constitutethe overt act which is an element of the conspiracy to commit that offense.Special conspiracies under Article 134.The United States Code prohibits conspiracies to commit certain specific offenses which do not require an overt act. These conspiraciesshould be charged under Article 134. Examples include conspiracies to impedeor injure any Federal officer in the discharge of duties under 18 U.S.C.--SECT-- 372, conspiracies against civil rights under 18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 241,and certain drug conspiracies under 21 U.S.C. --SECT-- 846. _See_ paragraph 60c(4)(c)(ii). Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Any person subject to the code who is found guilty of conspiracy shall be subject to the maximum punishment authorized for the offense which is the object of the conspiracy. However, with the exception noted below, if death is an authorized punishment for the offense which is the object of the conspiracy, the maximum punishment shall be dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for life without eligibility for parole. If the offense which is the object of the conspiracy is an offense under the law of war, the person knowingly performed an overt act for the purpose of bringing about the object of the conspiracy, and death results to one or more victims, the death penalty shall be an available punishment.Sample specification.Conspiracy.

Explanation.Instantaneous offense.The offense is complete when a solicitation is made or advice is given with the specific wrongful intent to influence another or others to commit any of the four offenses named in Article 82. It is not necessarythat the person or persons solicited or advised agree to or act upon thesolicitation or advice. Form of solicitation.Solicitation may be by means other than word of mouth or writing.Any act or conduct which reasonably may be construed as a serious requestor advice to commit one of the four offenses named in Article 82 may constitutesolicitation. It is not necessary that the accused act alone in the solicitationor in the advising; the accused may act through other persons in committingthis offense. Solicitations in violation of Article 134.Solicitation to commit offenses other than violations of the four offenses named in Article 82 may be charged as violations of Article 134. _See_ paragraph 105. However, some offenses require, as an elementof proof, some act of solicitation by the accused. These offenses are separateand distinct from solicitations under Articles 82 and 134. When the accused'sact of solicitation constitutes, by itself, a separate offense, the accusedshould be charged with that separate, distinct offense-for example,pandering (_see_ paragraph 97) and obstruction of justice(_see_ paragraph 96) in violation of Article 134. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.If the offense solicited or advised is committed or (in the caseof soliciting desertion or mutiny) attempted, then the accused shall bepunished with the punishment provided for the commission of the offensesolicited or advised. If the offense solicited or advised is not committedor (in the case of soliciting desertion or mutiny) attempted, then the followingpunishment may be imposed: To desert-Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 3 years. To mutiny-Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 10 years. To commit an act of misbehavior before the enemy-Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 10years. To commit an act of sedition-Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 10 years.

Fraudulent separation.That the accused was separated from an armed force; That the accused knowingly misrepresented or deliberately concealeda certain material fact or facts about the accused's eligibility for separation;and That the accused's separation was obtained or procured by thatknowingly false representation or deliberate concealment. Explanation.In general.A fraudulent enlistment, appointment, or separation is one procured by either a knowingly false representation as to any of the qualificationsprescribed by law, regulation, or orders for the specific enlistment, appointment, or separation, or a deliberate concealment as to any of those disqualifications.Matters that may be material to an enlistment, appointment, or separationinclude any information used by the recruiting, appointing, or separating officer in reaching a decision as to enlistment, appointment, or separationin any particular case, and any information that normally would have beenso considered had it been provided to that officer. Receipt of pay or allowances.A member of the armed forces who enlists or accepts an appointment without being regularly separated from a prior enlistment or appointmentshould be charged under Article 83 only if that member has received payor allowances under the fraudulent enlistment or appointment. Acceptance of food, clothing, shelter, or transportation from the government constitutesreceipt of allowances. However, whatever is furnished the accused while in custody, confinement, arrest, or other restraint pending trial for fraudulent enlistment or appointment is not considered an allowance. The receipt ofpay or allowances may be proved by circumstantial evidence. One offense.One who procures one's own enlistment, appointment, or separationby several misrepresentations or concealment as to qualifications for theone enlistment, appointment, or separation so procured, commits only oneoffense under Article 83.

--LSQP--Note: Paragraph 9a(a)(3) above has been held not tostate a separate offense by the United States Court ofMilitary Appeals in _United States v. Huff_, 22 C.M.R.37 (1956)--RSQP--

Elements.Desertion with intent to remain away permanently.That the accused absented himself or herself from his or her unit,organization, or place of duty;That such absence was without authority;That the accused, at the time the absence began or at some time during the absence, intended to remain away from his or her unit, organization,or place of duty permanently; andThat the accused remained absent until the date alleged.--LSQP--Note: If the absence was terminated by apprehension, addthe following element--RSQP--That the accused's absence was terminated by apprehension. Desertion with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.That the accused quit his or her unit, organization, or other place of duty;That the accused did so with the intent to avoid a certain dutyor shirk a certain service;That the duty to be performed was hazardous or the service important;That the accused knew that he or she would be required for suchduty or service; andThat the accused remained absent until the date alleged.Desertion before notice of acceptance of resignation.That the accused was a commissioned officer of an armed force ofthe United States, and had tendered his or her resignation;That before he or she received notice of the acceptance of theresignation, the accused quit his or her post or proper duties;That the accused did so with the intent to remain away permanently from his or her post or proper duties; andThat the accused remained absent until the date alleged.--LSQP--Note: If the absence was terminated by apprehension, add the following element--RSQP--That the accused's absence was terminated by apprehension.Attempted desertion.That the accused did a certain overt act;That the act was done with the specific intent to desert;That the act amounted to more than mere preparation; andThat the act apparently tended to effect the commission of theoffense of desertion.Explanation.Desertion with intent to remain away permanently.In general.Desertion with intent to remain away permanently is complete whenthe person absents himself or herself without authority from his or herunit, organization, or place of duty, with the intent to remain away therefrompermanently. A prompt repentance and return, while material in extenuation,is no defense. It is not necessary that the person be absent entirely frommilitary jurisdiction and control. Absence without authority-inception, duration, termination. _See_ paragraph10c.Intent to remain away permanently.The intent to remain away permanently from the unit, organization, or place of duty may be formed any time during the unauthorized absence.The intent need not exist throughout the absence, or for any particularperiod of time, as long as it exists at some time during the absence.The accused must have intended to remain away permanently from the unit, organization, or place of duty. When the accused had such an intent,it is no defense that the accused also intended to report for duty elsewhere,or to enlist or accept an appointment in the same or a different armed force.The intent to remain away permanently may be established by circumstantialevidence. Among the circumstances from which an inference may be drawn thatan accused intended to remain absent permanently are: that the period of absencewas lengthy; that the accused attempted to, or did, dispose of uniformsor other military property; that the accused purchased a ticket for a distantpoint or was arrested, apprehended, or surrendered a considerable distance from the accused's station; that the accused could have conveniently surrenderedto military control but did not; that the accused was dissatisfied with theaccused's unit, ship, or with military service; that the accused made remarksindicating an intention to desert; that the accused was under charges or had escaped from confinement at the time of the absence; that the accusedmade preparations indicative of an intent not to return (for example, financialarrangements); or that the accused enlisted or accepted an appointment inthe same or another armed force without disclosing the fact that the accused had not been regularly separated, or entered any foreign armed service without being authorized by the United States. On the other hand, the followingare included in the circumstances which may tend to negate an inferencethat the accused intended to remain away permanently: previous long and excellent service; that the accused left valuable personal property in the unit oron the ship; or that the accused was under the influence of alcohol or drugsduring the absence. These lists are illustrative only. Entries on documents, such as personnel accountability records,which administratively refer to an accused as a "deserter" arenot evidence of intent to desert. Proof of, or a plea of guilty to, an unauthorized absence, evenof extended duration, does not, without more, prove guilt of desertion.Effect of enlistment or appointment in the same or a different armed force.Article 85a(3) does not state a separate offense. Rather, it isa rule of evidence by which the prosecution may prove intent to remain awaypermanently. Proof of an enlistment or acceptance of an appointment in aservice without disclosing a preexisting duty status in the same or a different service provides the basis from which an inference of intent to permanently remain away from the earlier unit, organization, or place of duty may bedrawn. Furthermore, if a person, without being regularly separated fromone of the armed forces, enlists or accepts an appointment in the same oranother armed force, the person's presence in the military service undersuch an enlistment or appointment is not a return to military control anddoes not terminate any desertion or absence without authority from the earlierunit or organization, unless the facts of the earlier period of service areknown to military authorities. If a person, while in desertion, enlists oraccepts an appointment in the same or another armed force, and deserts whileserving the enlistment or appointment, the person may be tried and convictedfor each desertion.Quitting unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.Hazardous duty or important service."Hazardous duty" or "important service"may include service such as duty in a combat or other dangerous area; embarkationfor certain foreign or sea duty; movement to a port of embarkation for thatpurpose; entrainment for duty on the border or coast in time of war or threatenedinvasion or other disturbances; strike or riot duty; or employment in aidof the civil power in, for example, protecting property, or quelling or preventingdisorder in times of great public disaster. Such services as drill, targetpractice, maneuvers, and practice marches are not ordinarily "hazardousduty or important service." Whether a duty is hazardous or a serviceis important depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and isa question of fact for the court-martial to decide.Quits."Quits" in Article 85 means "goes absent without authority." Actual knowledge.Article 85 _a_(2) requires proof that the accused actually knew of the hazardous duty or important service. Actual knowledgemay be proved by circumstantial evidence. Attempting to desert.Once the attempt is made, the fact that the person desists, voluntarilyor otherwise, does not cancel the offense. The offense is complete, for example,if the person, intending to desert, hides in an empty freight car on a militaryreservation, intending to escape by being taken away in the car. Enteringthe car with the intent to desert is the overt act. For a more detaileddiscussion of attempts, _see_ paragraph 4. For an explanation concerning intent to remain away permanently, _see_ paragraph9c(1)(c). Prisoner with executed punitive discharge.A prisoner whose dismissal or dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge has been executed is not a "member of the armed forces" withinthe meaning of Articles 85 or 86, although the prisoner may still be subjectto military law under Article 2(_a_)(7). If the facts warrant,such a prisoner could be charged with escape from confinement under Article95 or an offense under Article 134.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Completed or attempted desertion with intent to avoid hazardous dutyor to shirk important service.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years. Other cases of completed or attempted desertion.Terminated by apprehension.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 3 years. Terminated otherwise.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years. In time of war. Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.Sample specifications.Desertion with intent to remain away permanently.

 **Any member of the armed forces who, without authority-****fails to go to his appointed place of duty at the time prescribed;****goes from that place; or****absents himself or remains absent from his unit, organization, or place of duty at which he is required to be at the time prescribed; 

shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**Elements.Failure to go to appointed place of duty.That a certain authority appointed a certain time and place of duty for the accused;That the accused knew of that time and place; andThat the accused, without authority, failed to go to the appointed place of duty at the time prescribed.Going from appointed place of duty.That a certain authority appointed a certain time and place of duty for the accused;That the accused knew of that time and place; andThat the accused, without authority, went from the appointed placeof duty after having reported at such place.Absence from unit, organization, or place of duty.That the accused absented himself or herself from his or her unit, organization, or place of duty at which he or she was required to be;That the absence was without authority from anyone competent togive him or her leave; andThat the absence was for a certain period of time.--LSQP--Note: if the absence was terminated by apprehension, addthe following element--RSQP--That the absence was terminated by apprehension.Abandoning watch or guard.That the accused was a member of a guard, watch, or duty; That the accused absented himself or herself from his or her guard, watch, or duty section;That absence of the accused was without authority; and--LSQP--Note: If the absence was with intent to abandon the accused's guard, watch, or duty section, add the following element--RSQP-- That the accused intended to abandon his or her guard, watch, orduty section. Absence from unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoidmaneuvers or field exercises.That the accused absented himself or herself from his or her unit, organization, or place of duty at which he or she was required to be;That the absence of the accused was without authority;That the absence was for a certain period of time;That the accused knew that the absence would occur during a partof a period of maneuvers or field exercises; andThat the accused intended to avoid all or part of a period of maneuvers or field exercises.Explanation.In general.This article is designed to cover every case not elsewhere provided for in which any member of the armed forces is through the member's ownfault not at the place where the member is required to be at a prescribedtime. It is not necessary that the person be absent entirely from military jurisdiction and control. The first part of this article-relating tothe appointed place of duty-applies whether the place is appointedas a rendezvous for several or for one only. Actual knowledge.The offenses of failure to go to and going from appointed placeof duty require proof that the accused actually knew of the appointed timeand place of duty. The offense of absence from unit, organization, or placeof duty with intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises requires proofthat the accused actually knew that the absence would occur during a partof a period of maneuvers or field exercises. Actual knowledge may be provedby circumstantial evidence.Intent.Specific intent is not an element of unauthorized absence. Specific intent is an element for certain aggravated unauthorized absences.Aggravated forms of unauthorized absence.There are variations of unauthorized absence under Article 86(3) which are more serious because of aggravating circumstances such as durationof the absence, a special type of duty from which the accused absents himselfor herself, and a particular specific intent which accompanies the absence.These circumstances are not essential elements of a violation of Article86. They simply constitute special matters in aggravation. The followingare aggravated unauthorized absences:Unauthorized absence for more than 3 days (duration).Unauthorized absence for more than 30 days (duration).Unauthorized absence from a guard, watch, or duty (special typeof duty). Unauthorized absence from guard, watch, or duty section with the intent to abandon it (special type of duty and specific intent).Unauthorized absence with the intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises (special type of duty and specific intent).Control by civilian authorities.A member of the armed forces turned over to the civilian authorities upon request under Article 14 (_see_ R.C.M. 106) is not absentwithout leave while held by them under that delivery. When a member of thearmed forces, being absent with leave, or absent without leave, is held,tried, and acquitted by civilian authorities, the member's status as absentwith leave, or absent without leave, is not thereby changed, regardlesshow long held. The fact that a member of the armed forces is convicted by the civilian authorities, or adjudicated to be a juvenile offender, or the case is "diverted" out of the regular criminal process for aprobationary period does not excuse any unauthorized absence, because themember's inability to return was the result of willful misconduct. If a memberis released by the civilian authorities without trial, and was on authorizedleave at the time of arrest or detention, the member may be found guiltyof unauthorized absence only if it is proved that the member actually committed the offense for which detained, thus establishing that the absence was the result of the member's own misconduct. Inability to return.The status of absence without leave is not changed by an inabilityto return through sickness, lack of transportation facilities, or otherdisabilities. But the fact that all or part of a period of unauthorizedabsence was in a sense enforced or involuntary is a factor in extenuationand should be given due weight when considering the initial disposition ofthe offense. When, however, a person on authorized leave, without fault,is unable to return at the expiration thereof, that person has not committedthe offense of absence without leave.Determining the unit or organization of an accused.A person undergoing transfer between activities is ordinarily consideredto be attached to the activity to which ordered to report. A person on temporaryadditional duty continues as a member of the regularly assigned unit andif the person is absent from the temporary duty assignment, the person becomesabsent without leave from both units, and may be charged with being absentwithout leave from either unit.Duration.Unauthorized absence under Article 86(3) is an instantaneous offense. It is complete at the instant an accused absents himself or herself withoutauthority. Duration of the absence is a matter in aggravation for the purposeof increasing the maximum punishment authorized for the offense. Even if the duration of the absence is not over 3 days, it is ordinarily allegedin an Article 86(3) specification. If the duration is not alleged or ifalleged but not proved, an accused can be convicted of and punished foronly 1 day of unauthorized absence.Computation of duration.In computing the duration of an unauthorized absence, any one continuousperiod of absence found that totals not more than 24 hours is counted as1 day; any such period that totals more than 24 hours and not more than48 hours is counted as 2 days, and so on. The hours of departure and return on different dates are assumed to be the same if not alleged and proved.For example, if an accused is found guilty of unauthorized absence from0600 hours, 4 April, to 1000 hours, 7 April of the same year (76 hours),the maximum punishment would be based on an absence of 4 days. However, ifthe accused is found guilty simply of unauthorized absence from 4 April to7 April, the maximum punishment would be based on an absence of 3 days.Termination-methods of return to military control.Surrender to military authority.A surrender occurs when a person presents himself or herself toany military authority, whether or not a member of the same armed force,notifies that authority of his or her unauthorized absence status, and submitsor demonstrates a willingness to submit to military control. Such a surrenderterminates the unauthorized absence.Apprehension by military authority.Apprehension by military authority of a known absentee terminatesan unauthorized absence. Delivery to military authority.Delivery of a known absentee by anyone to military authority terminatesthe unauthorized absence. Apprehension by civilian authorities at the request of the military.When an absentee is taken into custody by civilian authorities atthe request of military authorities, the absence is terminated.Apprehension by civilian authorities without prior military request.When an absentee is in the hands of civilian authorities for other reasons and these authorities make the absentee available for return tomilitary control, the absence is terminated when the military authoritiesare informed of the absentee's availability.Findings of more than one absence under one specification.An accused may properly be found guilty of two or more separate unauthorized absences under one specification, provided that each absenceis included within the period alleged in the specification and providedthat the accused was not misled. If an accused is found guilty of two ormore unauthorized absences under a single specification, the maximum authorizedpunishment shall not exceed that authorized if the accused had been foundguilty as charged in the specification.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Failing to go to, or going from, the appointed place of duty. Confinement for 1 month and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for 1 month. Absence from unit, organization, or other place of duty.For not more than 3 days. Confinement for 1 month and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for 1 month.For more than 3 days but not more than 30 days.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who throughneglect or design misses the movement of a ship, aircraft, or unit withwhich he is required in the course of duty to move shall be punished asa court-martial may direct.**Elements.That the accused was required in the course of duty to move witha ship, aircraft or unit;That the accused knew of the prospective movement of the ship,aircraft or unit; That the accused missed the movement of the ship, aircraft or unit; and That the accused missed the movement through design or neglect.Explanation.Movement."Movement" as used in Article 87 includes a move, transfer,or shift of a ship, aircraft, or unit involving a substantial distance andperiod of time. Whether a particular movement is substantial is a questionto be determined by the court-martial considering all the circumstances. Changes which do not constitute a "movement" include practice marches of a short duration with a return to the point of departure, andminor changes in location of ships, aircraft, or units, as when a ship isshifted from one berth to another in the same shipyard or harbor or whena unit is moved from one barracks to another on the same post.Mode of movement.Unit.If a person is required in the course of duty to move with a unit, the mode of travel is not important, whether it be military or commercial,and includes travel by ship, train, aircraft, truck, bus, or walking. Theword "unit" is not limited to any specific technical categorysuch as those listed in a table of organization and equipment, but also includesunits which are created before the movement with the intention that theyhave organizational continuity upon arrival at their destination regardlessof their technical designation, and units intended to be disbanded upon arrivalat their destination. Ship, aircraft.If a person is assigned as a crew member or is ordered to move asa passenger aboard a particular ship or aircraft, military or chartered,then missing the particular sailing or flight is essential to establishthe offense of missing movement. Design."Design" means on purpose, intentionally, or according to plan and requires specific intent to miss the movement. Neglect."Neglect" means the omission to take such measures asare appropriate under the circumstances to assure presence with a ship,aircraft, or unit at the time of a scheduled movement, or doing some actwithout giving attention to its probable consequences in connection withthe prospective movement, such as a departure from the vicinity of the prospectivemovement to such a distance as would make it likely that one could not returnin time for the movement.Actual knowledge.In order to be guilty of the offense, the accused must have actually known of the prospective movement that was missed. Knowledge of the exacthour or even of the exact date of the scheduled movement is not required.It is sufficient if the approximate date was known by the accused as longas there is a causal connection between the conduct of the accused and themissing of the scheduled movement. Knowledge may be proved by circumstantialevidence.Proof of absence. That the accused actually missed the movement may be proved by documentary evidence, as by a proper entry in a log or a morning report.This fact may also be proved by the testimony of personnel of the ship,aircraft, or unit (or by other evidence) that the movement occurred at acertain time, together with evidence that the accused was physically elsewhereat that time.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Design.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years. Neglect.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year. Sample specification. 

 In that  (personal jurisdictiondata), did, (at/on board-location), on orabout  20 , through (neglect) (design) miss the movement of(Aircraft No.  ) (Flight  ) (theUSS  ) (Company A, 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry) ( ) with which he/she was required in the course of dutyto move.Article 88-Contempt toward officialsText of statute. 

 **Any commissioned officer who uses contemptuouswords against the President, the Vice President, Congress, the Secretaryof Defense, the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Homeland Security,or the Governor or legislature of any State, Territory, Commonwealth, or possession in which he is on duty or present shall be punished as a court-martialmay direct.** Elements.That the accused was a commissioned officer of the United Statesarmed forces;That the accused used certain words against an official or legislature named in the article;That by an act of the accused these words came to the knowledgeof a person other than the accused; andThat the words used were contemptuous, either in themselves or by virtue of the circumstances under which they were used.--LSQP--Note: If the words were against a Governor or legislature,add the following element--RSQP--That the accused was then present in the State, Territory, Commonwealth,or possession of the Governor or legislature concerned.Explanation.The official or legislature against whom the words are used mustbe occupying one of the offices or be one of the legislatures named in Article88 at the time of the offense. Neither "Congress" nor "legislature"includes its members individually. "Governor" does not include "lieutenant governor." It is immaterial whether the words areused against the official in an official or private capacity. If not personallycontemptuous, adverse criticism of one of the officials or legislaturesnamed in the article in the course of a political discussion, even thoughemphatically expressed, may not be charged as a violation of the article.Similarly, expressions of opinion made in a purely private conversationshould not ordinarily be charged. Giving broad circulation to a written publicationcontaining contemptuous words of the kind made punishable by this article,or the utterance of contemptuous words of this kind in the presence of militarysubordinates, aggravates the offense. The truth or falsity of the statements is immaterial.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who behaveswith disrespect toward his superior commissioned officer shall be punishedas a court-martial may direct.**Elements.That the accused did or omitted certain acts or used certain language to or concerning a certain commissioned officer;That such behavior or language was directed toward that officer;That the officer toward whom the acts, omissions, or words were directed was the superior commissioned officer of the accused;That the accused then knew that the commissioned officer towardwhom the acts, omissions, or words were directed was the accused's superior commissioned officer; andThat, under the circumstances, the behavior or language was disrespectful to that commissioned officer.Explanation.Superior commissioned officer.Accused and victim in same uniformed service.If the accused and the victim are in the same uniformed service, the victim is a "superior commissioned officer" of the accused when eithersuperior in rank or command to the accused; however, the victim is not a"superior commissioned officer" of the accused if the victim is inferior in command, even though superior in rank.Accused and victim in different uniformed service.If the accused and the victim are in different uniformed services, the victim is a "superior commissioned officer" of the accused whenthe victim is a commissioned officer and superior in the chain of commandover the accused or when the victim, not a medical officer or a chaplain,is senior in grade to the accused and both are detained by a hostile entityso that recourse to the normal chain of command is prevented. The victimis not a "superior commissioned officer" of the accused merely because the victim is superior in grade to the accused.Execution of office.It is not necessary that the "superior commissioned officer"be in the execution of office at the time of the disrespectful behavior.Knowledge.If the accused did not know that the person against whom the actsor words were directed was the accused's superior commissioned officer,the accused may not be convicted of a violation of this article. Knowledgemay be proved by circumstantial evidence.Disrespect.Disrespectful behavior is that which detracts from the respect due the authority and person of a superior commissioned officer. It may consistof acts or language, however expressed, and it is immaterial whether theyrefer to the superior as an officer or as a private individual. Disrespectby words may be conveyed by abusive epithets or other contemptuous or denunciatorylanguage. Truth is no defense. Disrespect by acts includes neglecting thecustomary salute, or showing a marked disdain, indifference, insolence,impertinence, undue familiarity, or other rudeness in the presence of the superior officer.Presence.It is not essential that the disrespectful behavior be in the presenceof the superior, but ordinarily one should not be held accountable underthis article for what was said or done in a purely private conversation.Special defense-unprotected victim.A superior commissioned officer whose conduct in relation to the accused under all the circumstances departs substantially from the requiredstandards appropriate to that officer's rank or position under similar circumstancesloses the protection of this article. That accused may not be convictedof being disrespectful to the officer who has so lost the entitlement torespect protected by Article 89.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.Sample specification.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who-****strikes his superior commissioned officer or draws or lifts upany weapon or offers any violence against him while he is in the executionof his office; or****willfully disobeys a lawful command of his superior commissioned officer; 

shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time ofwar, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, andif the offense is committed at any other time, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct.**Elements.Striking or assaulting superior commissioned officer.That the accused struck, drew, or lifted up a weapon against, or offered violence against, a certain commissioned officer;That the officer was the superior commissioned officer of the accused;That the accused then knew that the officer was the accused's superior commissioned officer; andThat the superior commissioned officer was then in the executionof office. Disobeying superior commissioned officer.That the accused received a lawful command from a certain commissionedofficer; That this officer was the superior commissioned officer of theaccused; That the accused then knew that this officer was the accused'ssuperior commissioned officer; andThat the accused willfully disobeyed the lawful command.Explanation.Striking or assaulting superior commissioned officer.Definitions.Superior commissioned officer.The definitions in paragraph13c(1)(_a_) and (_b_) apply here and in subparagraph c(2).Strikes."Strikes" means an intentional blow, and includes any offensive touching of the person of an officer, however slight.Draws or lifts up any weapon against.The phrase "draws or lifts up any weapon against" covers any simple assault committed in the manner stated. The drawing of any weaponin an aggressive manner or the raising or brandishing of the same in a threateningmanner in the presence of and at the superior is the sort of act proscribed.The raising in a threatening manner of a firearm, whether or not loaded,of a club, or of anything by which a serious blow or injury could be givenis included in "lifts up."Offers any violence against.The phrase "offers any violence against" includes any form of battery or of mere assault not embraced in the preceding more specificterms "strikes" and "draws or lifts up." If notexecuted, the violence must be physically attempted or menaced. A mere threateningin words is not an offering of violence in the sense of this article.Execution of office.An officer is in the execution of office when engaged in any actor service required or authorized by treaty, statute, regulation, the orderof a superior, or military usage. In general, any striking or use of violenceagainst any superior officer by a person over whom it is the duty of thatofficer to maintain discipline at the time, would be striking or using violenceagainst the officer in the execution of office. The commanding officer onboard a ship or the commanding officer of a unit in the field is generallyconsidered to be on duty at all times.Knowledge.If the accused did not know the officer was the accused's superior commissioned officer, the accused may not be convicted of this offense.Knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence.Defenses.In a prosecution for striking or assaulting a superior commissioned officer in violation of this article, it is a defense that the accused actedin the proper discharge of some duty, or that the victim behaved in a mannertoward the accused such as to lose the protection of this article(_see_ paragraph 13c(5)). For example, if the victim initiated an unlawfulattack on the accused, this would deprive the victim of the protection ofthis article, and, in addition, could excuse any lesser included offenseof assault as done in self-defense, depending on the circumstances(_see_ paragraph 54c; R.C.M. 916(_e_)).Disobeying superior commissioned officer.Lawfulness of the order.Inference of lawfulness.An order requiring the performance of a military duty or act maybe inferred to be lawful and it is disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate.This inference does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as one thatdirects the commission of a crime.Determination of lawfulness.The lawfulness of an order is a question of law to be determined by the military judge.Authority of issuing officer.The commissioned officer issuing the order must have authority to give such an order. Authorization may be based on law, regulation, or customof the service.Relationship to military duty.The order must relate to military duty, which includes all activities reasonably necessary to accomplish a military mission, or safeguard or promotethe morale, discipline, and usefulness of members of a command and directlyconnected with the maintenance of good order in the service. The order maynot, without such a valid military purpose, interfere with private rightsor personal affairs. However, the dictates of a person's conscience, religion,or personal philosophy cannot justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwiselawful order. Disobedience of an order which has for its sole object theattainment of some private end, or which is given for the sole purpose ofincreasing the penalty for an offense which it is expected the accused maycommit, is not punishable under this article.Relationship to statutory or constitutional rights.The order must not conflict with the statutory or constitutional rights of the person receiving the order.Personal nature of the order.The order must be directed specifically to the subordinate. Violationsof regulations, standing orders or directives, or failure to perform previouslyestablished duties are not punishable under this article, but may violateArticle 92.Form and transmission of the order.As long as the order is understandable, the form of the order is immaterial, as is the method by which it is transmitted to the accused.Specificity of the order.The order must be a specific mandate to do or not to do a specific act. An exhortation to "obey the law" or to perform one's militaryduty does not constitute an order under this article. Knowledge.The accused must have actual knowledge of the order and of the fact that the person issuing the order was the accused's superior commissionedofficer. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Nature of the disobedience."Willful disobedience" is an intentional defiance of authority. Failure to comply with an order through heedlessness, remissness,or forgetfulness is not a violation of this article but may violate Article92.Time for compliance.When an order requires immediate compliance, an accused's declared intent not to obey and the failure to make any move to comply constitutes disobedience. Immediate compliance is required for any order that does not explicitly or implicitly indicate that delayed compliance is authorized or directed. If an order requires performance in the future, an accused's present statement of intention to disobey the order does not constitute disobedience of that order, although carrying out that intention may.

Unlike Articles89 and 90, however, this article does not require a superior-subordinaterelationship as an element of any of the offenses denounced. This articledoes not protect an acting noncommissioned officer or acting petty officer,nor does it protect military police or members of the shore patrol who arenot warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officers. Knowledge.All of the offenses prohibited by Article 91 require that the accused have actual knowledge that the victim was a warrant, noncommissioned, orpetty officer. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence.Striking or assaulting a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer.For a discussion of "strikes" and "in the execution of office," _see_ paragraph 14c.

 (Note: In cases where the dereliction of duty resulted in death or grievous bodily harm, add the following as applicable)That such dereliction of duty resulted in death or grievous bodily harm to a person other than the accused.Explanation.Violation of or failure to obey a lawful general order or regulation. Authority to issue general orders and regulations.General orders or regulations are those orders or regulations generallyapplicable to an armed force which are properly published by the Presidentor the Secretary of Defense, of Homeland Security, or of a military department,and those orders or regulations generally applicable to the command of theofficer issuing them throughout the command or a particular subdivision thereofwhich are issued by:an officer having general court-martial jurisdiction;a general or flag officer in command; ora commander superior to (i) or (ii). Effect of change of command on validity of order.A general order or regulation issued by a commander with authority under Article 92(1) retains its character as a general order or regulationwhen another officer takes command, until it expires by its own terms oris rescinded by separate action, even if it is issued by an officer who isa general or flag officer in command and command is assumed by another officerwho is not a general or flag officer. Lawfulness.A general order or regulation is lawful unless it is contrary tothe Constitution, the laws of the United States, or lawful superior ordersor for some other reason is beyond the authority of the official issuingit. _See_ the discussion of lawfulness in paragraph 14c(2)(a).Knowledge.Knowledge of a general order or regulation need not be alleged or proved, as knowledge is not an element of this offense and a lack of knowledgedoes not constitute a defense.Enforceability.Not all provisions in general orders or regulations can be enforced under Article 92(1). Regulations which only supply general guidelines oradvice for conducting military functions may not be enforceable under Article92(1).Violation of or failure to obey other lawful order.Scope.Article 92(2) includes all other lawful orders which may be issuedby a member of the armed forces, violations of which are not chargeableunder Article 90, 91, or 92(1). It includes the violation of written regulationswhich are not general regulations. _See also_ subparagraph(1)(e) above as applicable. Knowledge.In order to be guilty of this offense, a person must have had actual knowledge of the order or regulation. Knowledge of the order may be provedby circumstantial evidence.Duty to obey order.From a superior.A member of one armed force who is senior in rank to a member of another armed force is the superior of that member with authority to issueorders which that member has a duty to obey under the same circumstances as a commissioned officer of one armed force is the superior commissioned officer of a member of another armed force for the purposes of Articles89 and 90. _See_ paragraph 13c(1).From one not a superior.Failure to obey the lawful order of one not a superior is an offense under Article 92(2), provided the accused had a duty to obey the order,such as one issued by a sentinel or a member of the armed forces police. _See_ paragraph 15b(2) if the order was issued by a warrant, noncommissioned,or petty officer in the execution of office.Dereliction in the performance of duties.Duty.A duty may be imposed by treaty, statute, regulation, lawful order, standard operating procedure, or custom of the service.Knowledge.Actual knowledge of duties may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Actual knowledge need not be shown if the individual reasonably should haveknown of the duties. This may be demonstrated by regulations, training oroperating manuals, customs of the service, academic literature or testimony,testimony of persons who have held similar or superior positions, or similarevidence.Derelict.A person is derelict in the performance of duties when that person willfully or negligently fails to perform that person's duties or when thatperson performs them in a culpably inefficient manner. "Willfully"means intentionally. It refers to the doing of an act knowingly and purposely, specifically intending the natural and probable consequences of the act. "Negligently" means an act or omission of a person who is undera duty to use due care which exhibits a lack of that degree of care whicha reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similarcircumstances. "Culpable inefficiency" is inefficiency for whichthere is no reasonable or just excuse. Ineptitude.A person is not derelict in the performance of duties if the failure to perform those duties is caused by ineptitude rather than by willfulness,negligence, or culpable inefficiency, and may not be charged under thisarticle, or otherwise punished. For example, a recruit who has tried earnestlyduring rifle training and throughout record firing is not derelict in theperformance of duties if the recruit fails to qualify with the weapon.Grievous bodily harm. "Grievous bodily harm" means serious bodily injury. It does not include minor injuries, such as a black eye or a bloody nose, but does include fractured or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members of the body, serious damage to internal organs, and other serious bodily injuries.Where the dereliction of duty resulted in death or grievous bodily harm, an intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm is not required.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Violation of or failure to obey lawful general order or regulation.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years. Violation of or failure to obey other lawful order.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 6 months.--LSQP--Note: For (1) and (2), above, the punishment set forth doesnot apply in the following cases: if in the absence of the order or regulation which was violated or not obeyed the accused would on the same facts besubject to conviction for another specific offense for which a lesser punishmentis prescribed; or if the violation or failure to obey is a breach of restraintimposed as a result of an order. In these instances, the maximum punishmentis that specifically prescribed elsewhere for that particular offense.--RSQP--Dereliction in the performance of duties.Through neglect or culpable inefficiency.Forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for 3 months and confinement for 3 months.Through neglect or culpable inefficiency resulting in death or grievous bodily harm.

(Note: For (1) and (2) above, the punishment set forth does not apply in the following cases: if, in the absence of the order or regulation which was violated or not obeyed, the accused would on the same facts be subject to conviction for another specific offense for which a lesser punishment is prescribed; or if the violation or failure to obey is a breach of restraint imposed as a result of an order. In these instances, the maximum punishment is that specifically prescribed elsewhere for that particular offense.)Discussion If the dereliction of duty resulted in death, the accused may also be charged under Article 119 or Article 134 (negligent homicide), as applicable.Sample specifications.Violation or failure to obey lawful general order or regulation.

Assault, improper punishment,and sexual harassment may constitute this offense. Sexual harassment includesinfluencing, offering to influence, or threatening the career, pay, or jobof another person in exchange for sexual favors, and deliberate or repeated offensive comments or gestures of a sexual nature.

This concert of insubordinationneed not be preconceived, nor is it necessary that the insubordination beactive or violent. It may consist simply of a persistent and concerted refusalor omission to obey orders, or to do duty, with an insubordinate intent,that is, with an intent to usurp or override lawful military authority.The intent may be declared in words or inferred from acts, omissions, orsurrounding circumstances. Sedition.Sedition requires a concert of action in resistance to civil authority.This differs from mutiny by creating violence or disturbance. _See_ subparagraph c(1)(_a_) above. Failure to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition."Utmost" means taking those measures to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition which may properly be called for by the circumstances,including the rank, responsibilities, or employment of the person concerned."Utmost" includes the use of such force, including deadly force,as may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances to prevent and suppressa mutiny or sedition.Failure to report a mutiny or sedition.Failure to "take all reasonable means to inform" includes failure to take the most expeditious means available. When the circumstancesknown to the accused would have caused a reasonable person in similar circumstancesto believe that a mutiny or sedition was occurring, this may establish thatthe accused had such "reason to believe" that mutiny or seditionwas occurring. Failure to report an impending mutiny or sedition is not anoffense in violation of Article 94. _But see _ paragraph 16c(3)(dereliction of duty).Attempted mutiny.For a discussion of attempts, see paragraph 4.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.For all offenses under Article 94, death or such other punishmentas a court-martial may direct. Sample specifications.Mutiny by creating violence or disturbance.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who-****resists apprehension;****flees from apprehension;****breaks arrest; or****escapes from custody or confinement;

shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.** Elements.Resisting apprehension.That a certain person attempted to apprehend the accused;That said person was authorized to apprehend the accused; andThat the accused actively resisted the apprehension.Flight from apprehension.That a certain person attempted to apprehend the accused;That said person was authorized to apprehend the accused; andThat the accused fled from the appre- hension.Breaking arrest.That a certain person ordered the accused into arrest;That said person was authorized to order the accused into arrest;and That the accused went beyond the limits of arrest before beingreleased from that arrest by proper authority.Escape from custody.That a certain person apprehended the accused;That said person was authorized to apprehend the accused; andThat the accused freed himself or herself from custody before being released by proper authority.Escape from confinement.That a certain person ordered the accused into confinement;That said person was authorized to order the accused into confinement;and That the accused freed himself or herself from confinement before being released by proper authority.--LSQP--Note: If the escape was post-trial confinement, add the following element--RSQP-- That the confinement was the result of a court-martial conviction.Explanation.Resisting apprehension.Apprehension.Apprehension is the taking of a person into custody. _ See_ R.C.M. 302.Authority to apprehend. _See_ R.C.M. 302(_b_) concerningwho may apprehend. Whether the status of a person authorized that personto apprehend the accused is a question of law to be decided by the militaryjudge. Whether the person who attempted to make an apprehension had sucha status is a question of fact to be decided by the factfinder.Nature of the resistance.The resistance must be active, such as assaulting the person attemptingto apprehend. Mere words of opposition, argument, or abuse, and attemptsto escape from custody after the apprehension is complete, do not constitutethe offense of resisting apprehension although they may constitute otheroffenses.Mistake.It is a defense that the accused held a reasonable belief that the person attempting to apprehend did not have authority to do so. However,the accused's belief at the time that no basis exists for the apprehension is not a defense.Illegal apprehension.A person may not be convicted of resisting apprehension if theattempted apprehension is illegal, but may be convicted of other offenses,such as assault, depending on all the circumstances. An attempted apprehensionby a person authorized to apprehend is presumed to be legal in the absenceof evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily the legality of an apprehension isa question of law to be decided by the military judge. Flight from apprehension.The flight must be active, such as running or driving away.Breaking arrest.Arrest.There are two types of arrest: pretrial arrest under Article 9(_see_ R.C.M. 304) and arrest under Article 15 (_see_ paragraph 5c(3), Part V, MCM). This article prohibits breakingany arrest.Authority to order arrest. _See_ R.C.M. 304(b) and paragraphs 2 and 5b, PartV, MCM concerning authority to order arrest.Nature of restraint imposed by arrest.In arrest, the restraint is moral restraint imposed by orders fixing the limits of arrest. Breaking.Breaking arrest is committed when the person in arrest infringesthe limits set by orders. The reason for the infringement is immaterial.For example, innocence of the offense with respect to which an arrest mayhave been imposed is not a defense.Illegal arrest.A person may not be convicted of breaking arrest if the arrest is illegal. An arrest ordered by one authorized to do so is presumed to belegal in the absence of some evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily, the legalityof an arrest is a question of law to be decided by the military judge.Escape from custody.Custody."Custody" is restraint of free locomotion imposed by lawful apprehension. The restraint may be physical or, once there has beena submission to apprehension or a forcible taking into custody, it may consistof control exercised in the presence of the prisoner by official acts ororders. Custody is temporary restraint intended to continue until other restraint(arrest, restriction, confinement) is imposed or the person is released.Authority to apprehend. _See_ subparagraph (1)(_b_) above.Escape.For a discussion of escape, _see_ subparagraphc(5)(_c_), below. Illegal custody.A person may not be convicted of this offense if the custody was illegal. An apprehension effected by one authorized to apprehend is presumedto be lawful in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily, thelegality of an apprehension is a question of law to be decided by the militaryjudge.Correctional custody. _See_ paragraph 70.Escape from confinement.Confinement.Confinement is physical restraint imposed under R.C.M. 305, 1101,or paragraph 5b, Part V, MCM. For purposes of the element of post-trialconfinement (subparagraph b(5)(d), above) and increased punishment therefrom(subparagraph e(4), below), the confinement must have been imposed pursuantto an adjudged sentence of a court-martial and not as a result of pretrialrestraint or nonjudicial punishment.Authority to order confinement. _See_ R.C.M. 304(b); 1101; andparagraphs 2 and 5b, Part V, MCM concerning who may order confinement.Escape.An escape may be either with or without force or artifice, and either with or without the consent of the custodian. However, where a prisoneris released by one with apparent authority to do so, the prisoner may notbe convicted of escape from confinement. _See also_ paragraph20c(1)(b). Any completed casting off of the restraint of confinement, beforerelease by proper authority, is an escape, and lack of effectiveness ofthe restraint imposed is immaterial. An escape is not complete until theprisoner is momentarily free from the restraint. If the movement toward escapeis opposed, or before it is completed, an immediate pursuit follows, thereis no escape until opposition is overcome or pursuit is eluded.Status when temporarily outside confinement facility.A prisoner who is temporarily escorted outside a confinement facility for a work detail or other reason by a guard, who has both the duty andmeans to prevent that prisoner from escaping, remains in confinement. Legality of confinement.A person may not be convicted of escape from confinement if the confinement is illegal. Confinement ordered by one authorized to do so ispresumed to be lawful in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily,the legality of confinement is a question of law to be decided by the militaryjudge.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Resisting apprehension.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.Flight from apprehension.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.Breaking arrest.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 6 months.Escape from custody, pretrial confinement, or confinement on breadand water or diminished rations imposed pursuant to Article 15.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.Escape from post-trial confinement.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years.Sample specifications.Resisting apprehension.

Article 96-Releasing prisoner without proper authorityText of statute. 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, withoutproper authority, releases any prisoner committed to his charge, or whothrough neglect or design suffers any such prisoner to escape, shall bepunished as a court-martial may direct, whether or not the prisoner was committedin strict compliance with law.**Elements.Releasing a prisoner without proper authority.That a certain prisoner was committed to the charge of the accused;andThat the accused released the prisoner without proper authority.Suffering a prisoner to escape through neglect.That a certain prisoner was committed to the charge of the accused;That the prisoner escaped;That the accused did not take such care to prevent the escape asa reasonably careful person, acting in the capacity in which the accusedwas acting, would have taken in the same or similar circumstances; andThat the escape was the proximate result of the neglect.Suffering a prisoner to escape through design.That a certain prisoner was committed to the charge of the accused;That the design of the accused was to suffer the escape of that prisoner; and That the prisoner escaped as a result of the carrying out of the design of the accused.Explanation.Releasing a prisoner without proper authority.Prisoner."Prisoner" includes a civilian or military person whohas been confined.Release.The release of a prisoner is removal of restraint by the custodian rather than by the prisoner. Authority to release. _See_ R.C.M. 305(_g_) as to who mayrelease pretrial prisoners. Normally, the lowest authority competent toorder release of a post-trial prisoner is the commander who convened thecourt-martial which sentenced the prisoner or the officer exercising generalcourt-martial jurisdiction over the prisoner. _See also_ R.C.M. 1101.Committed.Once a prisoner has been confined, the prisoner has been "committed"in the sense of Article 96, and only a competent authority (_see_subparagraph (c)) may order release, regardless of failureto follow procedures prescribed by the code, this Manual, or other law.Suffering a prisoner to escape through neglect.Suffer."Suffer" means to allow or permit; not to forbid or hinder.Neglect."Neglect" is a relative term. It is the absence ofconduct which would have been taken by a reasonably careful person in thesame or similar circumstances.Escape.Escape is defined in paragraph 19.c.(4)(c).Status of prisoner after escape not a defense.After escape, the fact that a prisoner returns, is captured, killed, or otherwise dies is not a defense. Suffering a prisoner to escape through design.An escape is suffered through design when it is intended. Such intent may be inferred from conduct so wantonly devoid of care that the only reasonableinference which may be drawn is that the escape was contemplated as a probableresult.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, exceptas provided by law, apprehends, arrests, or confines any person shall bepunished as a court-martial may direct.** Elements.That the accused apprehended, arrested, or confined a certain person; and That the accused unlawfully exercised the accused's authority todo so. Explanation.Scope.This article prohibits improper acts by those empowered by the code to arrest, apprehend, or confine. _See_ Articles 7 and 9;R.C.M. 302, 304, 305, and 1101, and paragraphs 2 and 5b, Part V.

Enemy."Enemy" includes organized forces of the enemy in timeof war, any hostile body that our forces may be opposing, such as a rebelliousmob or a band of renegades, and includes civilians as well as members ofmilitary organizations. "Enemy" is not restricted to the enemygovernment or its armed forces. All the citizens of one belligerent are enemiesof the government and all the citizens of the other. Before the enemy.Whether a person is "before the enemy" is a questionof tactical relation, not distance. For example, a member of an antiaircraftgun crew charged with opposing anticipated attack from the air, or a memberof a unit about to move into combat may be before the enemy although milesfrom the enemy lines. On the other hand, an organization some distance fromthe front or immediate area of combat which is not a part of a tacticaloperation then going on or in immediate prospect is not "before orin the presence of the enemy" within the meaning of this article.Shamefully abandoning, surrendering, or delivering up of command.Scope.This provision concerns primarily commanders chargeable with responsibilityfor defending a command, unit, place, ship or military property.

Fear.Fear is a natural feeling of apprehension when going into battle.The mere display of apprehension does not constitute this offense. Nature of offense.Refusal or abandonment of a performance of duty before or in the presence of the enemy as a result of fear constitutes this offense. Defense.Genuine and extreme illness, not generated by cowardice, is a defense.Quitting place of duty to plunder or pillage.Place of duty."Place of duty" includes any place of duty, whether permanent or temporary, fixed or mobile. Plunder or pillage."Plunder or pillage" means to seize or appropriate public or private property unlawfully. Nature of offense.The essence of this offense is quitting the place of duty with intent to plunder or pillage. Merely quitting with that purpose is sufficient,even if the intended misconduct is not done. Causing false alarms.This provision covers spreading of false or disturbing rumors or reports, as well as the false giving of established alarm signals. Willfully failing to do utmost to encounter enemy.Willfully refusing a lawful order to go on a combat patrol mayviolate this provision.

Article 100-Subordinate compelling surrenderText of statute. 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who compelsor attempts to compel the commander of any place, vessel, aircraft, or othermilitary property, or of any body of members of the armed forces, to giveit up to an enemy or to abandon it, or who strikes the colors or flag toan enemy without proper authority, shall be punished by death or such otherpunishment as a court-martial may direct.** Elements.Compelling surrender.That a certain person was in command of a certain place, vessel, aircraft, or other military property or of a body of members of the armedforces; That the accused did an overt act which was intended to and did compel that commander to give it up to the enemy or abandon it; and That the place, vessel, aircraft, or other military property orbody of members of the armed forces was actually given up to the enemy orabandoned.

Striking the colors or flag.That there was an offer of surrender to an enemy; That this offer was made by striking the colors or flag to the enemy or in some other manner; That the accused made or was responsible for the offer; and That the accused did not have proper authority to make the offer.Explanation.Compelling surrender.Nature of offense.The offenses under this article are similar to mutiny or attempted mutiny designed to bring about surrender or abandonment. Unlike some casesof mutiny, however, concert of action is not an essential element of theoffenses under this article. The offense is not complete until the place,military property, or command is actually abandoned or given up to the enemy.Surrender."Surrender" and "to give it up to an enemy" are synonymous. Acts required.The surrender or abandonment must be compelled or attempted to be compelled by acts rather than words. Attempting to compel surrender.The offense of attempting to compel a surrender or abandonment does not require actual abandonment or surrender, but there must be some actdone with this purpose in view, even if it does not accomplish the purpose.Striking the colors or flag.In general.To "strike the colors or flag" is to haul down the colors or flag in the face of the enemy or to make any other offer of surrender.It is traditional wording for an act of surrender. Nature of offense.The offense is committed when one assumes the authority to surrender a military force or position when not authorized to do so either by competentauthority or by the necessities of battle. If continued battle has becomefruitless and it is impossible to communicate with higher authority, thosefacts will constitute proper authority to surrender. The offense may be committed whenever there is sufficient contact with the enemy to give the opportunityof making an offer of surrender and it is not necessary that an engagementwith the enemy be in progress. It is unnecessary to prove that the offerwas received by the enemy or that it was rejected or accepted. The sendingof an emissary charged with making the offer or surrender is an act sufficientto prove the offer, even though the emissary does not reach the enemy.

Before disclosing sucha word, a person subject to military law must determine at that person'speril that the recipient is a person authorized to receive it. Intent, motive, negligence, mistake, ignorance not defense.The accused's intent or motive in disclosing the countersign or parole is immaterial to the issue of guilt, as is the fact that the disclosurewas negligent or inadvertent.

Explanation.In time of war. _See_ R.C.M. 103(19). Enemy.For a discussion of "enemy," _see_ paragraph23c(1)(b). Scope of offense.The words "any person" bring within the jurisdictionof general courts-martial and military commissions all persons of whatevernationality or status who commit spying. Nature of offense.A person can be a spy only when, acting clandestinely or under false pretenses, that person obtains or seeks to obtain information with the intentto convey it to a hostile party. It is not essential that the accused obtainthe information sought or that it be communicated. The offense is completewith lurking or acting clandestinely or under false pretenses with intentto accomplish these objects. Intent.It is necessary to prove an intent to convey information to the enemy. This intent may be inferred from evidence of a deceptive insinuationof the accused among our forces, but evidence that the person had come withinthe lines for a comparatively innocent purpose, as to visit family or toreach friendly lines by assuming a disguise, is admissible to rebut thisinference. Persons not included under "spying."Members of a military organization not wearing a disguise, dispatch drivers, whether members of a military organization or civilians, and personsin ships or aircraft who carry out their missions openly and who have penetratedenemy lines are not spies because, while they may have resorted to concealment,they have not acted under false pretenses. A spy who, after rejoining the armed forces to which the spy belongs, is later captured by the enemy incurs no responsibility for previous actsof espionage. A person living in occupied territory who, without lurking, or acting clandestinely or under false pretenses, merely reports what is seen or heard through agents to the enemy may be charged under Article 104 with givingintelligence to or communicating with the enemy, but may not be chargedunder this article as being a spy.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, withoutproper authority-****sells or otherwise disposes of;****willfully or through neglect damages, destroys, or loses; or****willfully or through neglect suffers to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of, any military property of the United States,shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**Elements.Selling or otherwise disposing of military property.That the accused sold or otherwise disposed of certain property (which was a firearm or explosive); That the sale or disposition was without proper authority; That the property was military property of the United States; andThat the property was of a certain value. Damaging, destroying, or losing military property.That the accused, without proper authority, damaged or destroyed certain property in a certain way, or lost certain property; That the property was military property of the United States; That the damage, destruction, or loss was willfully caused by the accused or was the result of neglect by the accused; and That the property was of a certain value or the damage was of a certain amount. Suffering military property to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of.That certain property (which was a firearm or explosive) was lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of; That the property was military property of the United States; That the loss, damage, destruction, sale, or wrongful dispositionwas suffered by the accused, without proper authority, through a certainomission of duty by the accused; That the omission was willful or negligent; and That the property was of a certain value or the damage was of a certain amount. Explanation.Military property.Military property is all property, real or personal, owned, held, or used by one of the armed forces of the United States. Military property is a term of art, and should not be confused with government property. The terms are not interchangeable. While all military property is government property, not all government property is military property. An item of government property is not military property unless the item in question meets the definition provided above. It is immaterial whether the property sold, disposed, destroyed, lost, or damaged had been issued to the accused, to someone else, or even issued at all. If it is proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence that items of individual issue were issued to the accused, it may be inferred, depending on all the evidence, that the damage, destruction, or loss proved was due to the neglect of the accused. Retail merchandise of service exchange stores is not military property under this article.Suffering military property to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold,or wrongfully disposed of."To suffer" means to allow or permit. The willful or negligent sufferance specified by this article includes: deliberate violationor intentional disregard of some specific law, regulation, or order; recklessor unwarranted personal use of the property; causing or allowing it to remainexposed to the weather, insecurely housed, or not guarded; permitting itto be consumed, wasted, or injured by other persons; or loaning it to aperson, known to be irresponsible, by whom it is damaged. Value and damage.In the case of loss, destruction, sale, or wrongful disposition,the value of the property controls the maximum punishment which may be adjudged.In the case of damage, the amount of damage controls. As a general rule,the amount of damage is the estimated or actual cost of repair by the governmentagency normally employed in such work, or the cost of replacement, as shownby government price lists or otherwise, whichever is less. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Selling or otherwise disposing of military property.Of a value of $500.00 or less.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year. Of a value of more than $500.00 or any firearm or explosive.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 10 years.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who willfullyor recklessly wastes, spoils, or otherwise willfully and wrongfully destroysor damages any property other than military property of the United Statesshall be punished as a court-martial may direct.** Elements.Wasting or spoiling of non-military property.That the accused willfully or recklessly wasted or spoiled certainreal property in a certain manner; That the property was that of another person; and That the property was of a certain value. Destroying or damaging non-military property.That the accused willfully and wrongfully destroyed or damaged certain personal property in a certain manner; That the property was that of another person; and That the property was of a certain value or the damage was of a certain amount. Explanation.Wasting or spoiling non-military property.This portion of Article 109 proscribes willful or reckless wasteor spoliation of the real property of another. The terms "wastes"and "spoils" as used in this article refer to such wrongfulacts of voluntary destruction of or permanent damage to real property asburning down buildings, burning piers, tearing down fences, or cutting downtrees. This destruction in punishable whether done willfully, that is intentionally,or recklessly, that is through a culpable disregard of the foreseeable consequences of some voluntary act. Destroying or damaging non-military property.This portion of Article 109 proscribes the willful and wrongful destruction or damage of the personal property of another. To be destroyed,the property need not be completely demolished or annihilated, but mustbe sufficiently injured to be useless for its intended purpose. Damage consistsof any physical injury to the property. To constitute an offense under thissection, the destruction or damage of the property must have been willfuland wrongful. As used in this section "willfully" means intentionallyand "wrongfully" means contrary to law, regulation, lawful order,or custom. Willfulness may be proved by circumstantial evidence, such asthe manner in which the acts were done. Value and damage.In the case of destruction, the value of the property destroyed controls the maximum punishment which may be adjudged. In the case of damage,the amount of the damage controls. As a general rule, the amount of damageis the estimated or actual cost of repair by artisans employed in this workwho are available to the community wherein the owner resides, or the replacementcost, whichever is less. _See also_ paragraph 46c(1)(g).

Article 110-Improper hazarding of vesselText of statute.**Any person subject to this chapter who willfully and wrongfully hazards or suffers to be hazarded any vessel of the armed forces shall suffer death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.****Any person subject to this chapter who negligently hazards orsuffers to be hazarded any vessel of the armed forces shall be punished asa court-martial may direct.**Elements.That a vessel of the armed forces was hazarded in a certain manner;and That the accused by certain acts or omissions, willfully and wrongfully, or negligently, caused or suffered the vessel to be hazarded. Explanation.Hazard."Hazard" means to put in danger of loss or injury. Actual damage to, or loss of, a vessel of the armed forces by collision, stranding,running upon a shoal or a rock, or by any other cause, is conclusive evidencethat the vessel was hazarded but not of the fact of culpability on the partof any particular person. "Stranded" means run aground so thatthe vessel is fast for a time. If the vessel "touches and goes,"she is not stranded; if she "touches and sticks," she is. A shoalis a sand, mud, or gravel bank or bar that makes the water shallow. Willfully and wrongfully.As used in this article, "willfully" means intentionally and "wrongfully" means contrary to law, regulation, lawful order,or custom. Negligence."Negligence" as used in this article means the failureto exercise the care, prudence, or attention to duties, which the interestsof the government require a prudent and reasonable person to exercise underthe circumstances. This negligence may consist of the omission to do somethingthe prudent and reasonable person would have done, or the doing of somethingwhich such a person would not have done under the circumstances. No personis relieved of culpability who fails to perform such duties as are imposedby the general responsibilities of that person's grade or rank, or by thecustoms of the service for the safety and protection of vessels of the armedforces, simply because these duties are not specifically enumerated in a regulation or order. However, a mere error in judgment that a reasonablyable person might have committed under the same circumstances does not constitutean offense under this article. Suffer."To suffer" means to allow or permit. A ship is willfully suffered to be hazarded by one who, although not in direct control of thevessel, knows a danger to be imminent but takes no steps to prevent it,as by a plotting officer of a ship under way who fails to report to the officerof the deck a radar target which is observed to be on a collision coursewith, and dangerously close to, the ship. A suffering through neglect impliesan omission to take such measures as were appropriate under the circumstancesto prevent a foreseeable danger. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Hazarding or suffering to be hazarded any vessel of the armed forces:Willfully and wrongfully.Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct. Negligently.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years.

**(a) Any person subject to this chapter who-****operates or physically controls any vehicle, aircraft, or vessel in a reckless or wanton manner or while impaired by a substance described in section 912a(b) of this title (Article 112a(b)); or****operates or is in actual physical control of any vehicle, aircraft, or vessel while drunk or when the alcohol concentration in the person's blood or breath is equal to or exceeds the applicable limit under subsection (b), shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.****(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a), the applicable limit on the alcohol concentration in a person's blood or breath is as follows:** **(A) In the case of the operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel in the United States, such limit is the lesser of-** **(i) the blood alcohol content limit under the law of the State in which the conduct occurred, except as may be provided under paragraph (2) for conduct on a military installation that is in more than one State; or** **(ii) the blood alcohol content limit specified in paragraph (3).** **(B) In the case of the operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel outside the United States, the applicable blood alcohol content limit is the blood alcohol content limit specified in paragraph (3) or such lower limit as the Secretary of Defense may by regulation prescribe.****(2) In the case of a military installation that is in more than one State, if those States have different blood alcohol content limits under their respective State laws, the Secretary may select one such blood alcohol content limit to apply uniformly on that installation.****(3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the blood alcohol content limit with respect to alcohol concentration in a person's blood is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood and with respect to alcohol concentration in a person's breath is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, as shown by chemical analysis.****(4) In this subsection:** **(A) The term "blood alcohol content limit" means the amount of alcohol concentration in a person's blood or breath at which operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel is prohibited.** **(B) The term "United States" includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa and the term "State" includes each of those jurisdictions.**Elements.That the accused was operating or in physical control of a vehicle,aircraft, or vessel; andThat while operating or in physical control of a vehicle, aircraft,or vessel, the accused:did so in a wanton or reckless manner, orwas drunk or impaired, orthe alcohol concentration in the accused's blood or breath equaled or exceeded the applicable limit under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 35a. --LSQP--NOTE: If injury resulted add the following element--RSQP--That the accused thereby caused the vehicle, aircraft, or vesselto injure a person. Explanation.Vehicle._See_ 1 U.S.C. --SECT-- 4. Vessel._See._ 1 U.S.C. --SECT-- 3. Aircraft.Any contrivance used or designed for transportation in the air.Operates.Operating a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel includes not only driving or guiding a vehicle, aircraft or vessel while it is in motion, either inperson or through the agency of another, but also setting of its motivepower in action or the manipulation of its controls so as to cause the particularvehicle, aircraft or vessel to move. Physical control and actual physical control.These terms as used in the statute are synonymous. They describethe present capability and power to dominate, direct or regulate the vehicle,vessel, or aircraft, either in person or through the agency of another,regardless of whether such vehicle, aircraft, or vessel is operated. Forexample, the intoxicated person seated behind the steering wheel of a vehiclewith the keys of the vehicle in or near the ignition but with the enginenot turned on could be deemed in actual physical control of that vehicle.However, the person asleep in the back seat with the keys in his or her pocketwould not be deemed in actual physical control. Physical control necessarilyencompasses operation. Drunk or impaired."Drunk" and "impaired" mean any intoxication which is sufficient to impair the rational and full exercise of the mentalor physical faculties. The term drunk is used in relation to intoxicationby alcohol. The term impaired is used in relation to intoxication by a substancedescribed in Article 112(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice. Reckless.The operation or physical control of a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is "reckless" when it exhibits a culpable disregard of foreseeableconsequences to others from the act or omission involved. Recklessness isnot determined solely by reason of the happening of an injury, or the invasionof the rights of another, nor by proof alone of excessive speed or erraticoperation, but all these factors may be admissible and relevant as bearingupon the ultimate question: whether, under all the circumstances, the accused'smanner of operation or physical control of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraftwas of that heedless nature which made it actually or imminently dangerousto the occupants, or to the rights or safety of others. It is operatingor physically controlling a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft with such a highdegree of negligence that if death were caused, the accused would have committedinvoluntary manslaughter, at least. The nature of the conditions in whichthe vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is operated or controlled, the time of dayor night, the proximity and number of other vehicles, vessels, or aircraftand the condition of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, are often mattersof importance in the proof of an offense charged under this article and, where they are of importance, may properly be alleged. Wanton."Wanton" includes "reckless," but in describingthe operation or physical control of a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft "wanton"may, in a proper case, connote willfulness, or a disregard of probable consequences,and thus describe a more aggravated offense. Causation.The accused's drunken or reckless driving must be a proximate cause of injury for the accused to be guilty of drunken or reckless driving resultingin personal injury. To be proximate, the accused's actions need not bethe sole cause of the injury, nor must they be the immediate cause of theinjury, that is, the latest in time and space preceding the injury. A contributingcause is deemed proximate only if it plays a material role in the victim'sinjury. Separate offenses.While the same course of conduct may constitute violations of both subsections (1) and (2) of the Article, e.g., both drunken and recklessoperation or physical control, this article proscribes the conduct describedin both subsections as separate offenses, which may be charged separately. However, as recklessness is a relative matter, evidence of all the surroundingcircumstances that made the operation dangerous, whether alleged or not,may be admissible. Thus, on a charge of reckless driving, for example, evidenceof drunkenness might be admissible as establishing one aspect of the recklessness,and evidence that the vehicle exceeded a safe speed, at a relevant priorpoint and time, might be admissible as corroborating other evidence of the specific recklessness charged. Similarly, on a charge of drunken driving, relevant evidence of recklessness might have probative value as corroboratingother proof of drunkenness. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Resulting in personal injury.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 18 months. No personal injury involved.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 6 months. Sample specification.

 **Any person subject to this chapter other thansentinel or look-out, who is found drunk on duty, shall be punished as acourt-martial may direct.** Elements.That the accused was on a certain duty; and That the accused was found drunk while on this duty. Explanation.Drunk._See_ paragraph 35c(6). Duty."Duty" as used in this article means military duty.Every duty which an officer or enlisted person may legally be required bysuperior authority to execute is necessarily a military duty. Within themeaning of this article, when in the actual exercise of command, the commanderof a post, or of a command, or of a detachment in the field is constantlyon duty, as is the commanding officer on board a ship. In the case of otherofficers or enlisted persons, "on duty" relates to duties orroutine or detail, in garrison, at a station, or in the field, and does notrelate to those periods when, no duty being required of them by orders orregulations, officers and enlisted persons occupy the status of leisureknown as "off duty" or "on liberty." In a region of active hostilities, the circumstances are often such that all members ofa command may properly be considered as being continuously on duty within the meaning of this article. So also, an officer of the day and members ofthe guard, or of the watch, are on duty during their entire tour withinthe meaning of this article. Nature of offense.It is necessary that the accused be found drunk while actually onthe duty alleged, and the fact the accused became drunk before going onduty, although material in extenuation, does not affect the question ofguilt. If, however, the accused does not undertake the responsibility orenter upon the duty at all, the accused's conduct does not fall within theterms of this article, nor does that of a person who absents himself orherself from duty and is found drunk while so absent. Included within thearticle is drunkenness while on duty of an anticipatory nature such as thatof an aircraft crew ordered to stand by for flight duty, or of an enlistedperson ordered to stand by for guard duty. Defenses.If the accused is known by superior authorities to be drunk at the time a duty is assigned, and the accused is thereafter allowed to assumethat duty anyway, or if the drunkenness results from an accidental overdosage administered for medicinal purposes, the accused will have a defenseto this offense. _But see_ paragraph 76 (incapacitation forduty). Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 9 months. Sample specification.

Wrongful use of controlled substance.That the accused used a controlled substance; and That the use by the accused was wrongful. Wrongful distribution of controlled substance.That the accused distributed a certain amount of a controlled substance;and That the distribution by the accused was wrongful. Wrongful introduction of a controlled substance.That the accused introduced onto a vessel, aircraft, vehicle, or installation used by the armed forces or under the control of the armedforces a certain amount of a controlled substance; and That the introduction was wrongful. Wrongful manufacture of a controlled substance.That the accused manufactured a certain amount of a controlledsubstance; and That the manufacture was wrongful. Wrongful possession, manufacture, or introduction of a controlledsubstance with intent to distribute.That the accused (possessed) (manufactured) (introduced) a certain amount of a controlled substance; That the (possession) (manufacture) (introduction) was wrongful;and That the (possession) (manufacture) (introduction) was with the intent to distribute. Wrongful importation or exportation of a controlled substance.That the accused (imported into the customs territory of) (exported from) the United States a certain amount of a controlled substance; andThat the (importation) (exportation) was wrongful.--LSQP--Note: When any of the aggravating circumstances listed in subparagraph e is alleged, it must be listed as an element.--RSQP-- Explanation.Controlled substance."Controlled substance" means amphetamine, cocaine,heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide, marijuana, methamphetamine, opium, phencyclidine,and barbituric acid, including phenobarbital and secobarbital. "Controlledsubstance" also means any substance which is included in SchedulesI through V established by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C.812). Possess."Possess" means to exercise control of something. Possessionmay be direct physical custody like holding an item in one's hand, or itmay be constructive, as in the case of a person who hides an item in a lockeror car to which that person may return to retrieve it. Possession must beknowing and conscious. Possession inherently includes the power or authorityto preclude control by others. It is possible, however, for more than one person to possess an item simultaneously, as when several people share controlof an item. An accused may not be convicted of possession of a controlledsubstance if the accused did not know that the substance was present underthe accused's control. Awareness of the presence of a controlled substancemay be inferred from circumstantial evidence. Distribute."Distribute" means to deliver to the possession ofanother. "Deliver" means the actual, constructive, or attemptedtransfer of an item, whether or not there exists an agency relationship.Manufacture."Manufacture" means the production, preparation, propagation,compounding, or processing of a drug or other substance, either directlyor indirectly or by extraction from substances of natural origin, or independentlyby means of chemical synthesis or by a combination of extraction and chemicalsynthesis, and includes any packaging or repackaging of such substance orlabeling or relabeling of its container. "Production," as usedin this subparagraph, includes the planting, cultivating, growing, or harvesting of a drug or other substance. Wrongfulness.To be punishable under Article 112a, possession, use, distribution, introduction, or manufacture of a controlled substance must be wrongful.Possession, use, distribution, introduction, or manufacture of a controlledsubstance is wrongful if it is without legal justification or authorization.Possession, distribution, introduction, or manufacture of a controlled substanceis not wrongful if such act or acts are: (A) done pursuant to legitimatelaw enforcement activities (for example, an informant who receives drugsas part of an undercover operation is not in wrongful possession); (B) doneby authorized personnel in the performance of medical duties; or (C) withoutknowledge of the contraband nature of the substance (for example, a personwho possesses cocaine, but actually believes it to be sugar, is not guiltyof wrongful possession of cocaine). Possession, use, distribution, introduction,or manufacture of a controlled substance may be inferred to be wrongfulin the absence of evidence to the contrary. The burden of going forward with evidence with respect to any such exception in any court-martial or otherproceeding under the code shall be upon the person claiming its benefit.If such an issue is raised by the evidence presented, then the burden ofproof is upon the United States to establish that the use, possession, distribution,manufacture, or introduction was wrongful. Intent to distribute.Intent to distribute may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. Examples of evidence which may tend to support an inference of intent todistribute are: possession of a quantity of substance in excess of thatwhich one would be likely to have for personal use; market value of the substance;the manner in which the substance is packaged; and that the accused is nota user of the substance. On the other hand, evidence that the accused isaddicted to or is a heavy user of the substance may tend to negate an inferenceof intent to distribute. Certain amount.When a specific amount of a controlled substance is believed tohave been possessed, distributed, introduced, or manufactured by an accused,the specific amount should ordinarily be alleged in the specification. Itis not necessary to allege a specific amount, however, and a specification is sufficient if it alleges that an accused possessed, distributed, introduced,or manufactured "some," "traces of," or "anunknown quantity of" a controlled substance. Missile launch facility.A "missile launch facility" includes the place fromwhich missiles are fired and launch control facilities from which the launchof a missile is initiated or controlled after launch. Customs territory of the United States."Customs territory of the United States" includes only the States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Use."Use" means to inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce into the human body, any controlled substance. Knowledge of thepresence of the controlled substance is a required component of use. Knowledgeof the presence of the controlled substance may be inferred from the presenceof the controlled substance in the accused's body or from other circumstantialevidence.

Article 113-Misbehavior of sentinel or lookoutText of statute. 

 **Any sentinel or look-out who is found drunkor sleeping upon his post, or leaves it before he is regularly relieved,shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death orsuch other punishment as a court-martial may direct, but if the offense is committed at any other time, by such punishment other than death as a court-martialmay direct.** Elements.That the accused was posted or on post as a sentinel or lookout;That the accused was found drunk while on post, was found sleeping while on post, or left post before being regularly relieved.--LSQP--Note: If the offense was committed in time of war or whilethe accused was receiving special pay under 37 U.S.C. --SECT-- 310, add thefollowing element--RSQP--That the offense was committed (in time of war) (while the accused was receiving special pay under 37 U.S.C. --SECT-- 310). Explanation.In general.This article defines three kinds of misbehavior committed by sentinelsor lookouts: being found drunk or sleeping upon post, or leaving it beforebeing regularly relieved. This article does not include an officer or enlistedperson of the guard, or of a ship's watch, not posted or performing the dutiesof a sentinel or lookout, nor does it include a person whose duties as awatchman or attendant do not require constant alertness. Post."Post" is the area where the sentinel or lookout is required to be for the performance of duties. It is not limited by an imaginaryline, but includes, according to orders or circumstances, such surrounding area as may be necessary for the proper performance of the duties for which the sentinel or lookout was posted. The offense of leaving post is not committedwhen a sentinel or lookout goes an immaterial distance from the post, unlessit is such a distance that the ability to fully perform the duty for whichposted is impaired. On post.A sentinel or lookout becomes "on post" after havingbeen given a lawful order to go "on post" as a sentinel or lookoutand being formally or informally posted. The fact that a sentinel or lookoutis not posted in the regular way is not a defense. It is sufficient, forexample, if the sentinel or lookout has taken the post in accordance withproper instruction, whether or not formally given. A sentinel or lookoutis on post within the meaning of the article not only when at a post physicallydefined, as is ordinarily the case in garrison or aboard ship, but also,for example, when stationed in observation against the approach of an enemy,or detailed to use any equipment designed to locate friend, foe, or possibledanger, or at a designated place to maintain internal discipline, or to guardstores, or to guard prisoners while in confinement or at work. Sentinel or lookout.A sentinel or a lookout is a person whose duties include the requirementto maintain constant alertness, be vigilant, and remain awake, in order toobserve for the possible approach of the enemy, or to guard persons, property,or a place and to sound the alert, if necessary. Drunk.For an explanation of "drunk," _see_paragraph 35c(3). Sleeping.As used in this article, "sleeping" is that conditionof insentience which is sufficient sensibly to impair the full exerciseof the mental and physical faculties of a sentinel or lookout. It is notnecessary to show that the accused was in a wholly comatose condition. Thefact that the accused's sleeping resulted from a physical incapacity causedby disease or accident is an affirmative defense. _See_ R.C.M.916(i). Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.In time of war.Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.

 **Any person subject to this chapter whofights or promotes, or is concerned in or connives at fighting a duel, orwho, having knowledge of a challenge sent or about to be sent, fails toreport the fact promptly to the proper authority, shall be punished as acourt-martial may direct.** Elements.Dueling.That the accused fought another person with deadly weapons; That the combat was for private reasons; and That the combat was by prior agreement. Promoting a duel.That the accused promoted a duel between certain persons; and That the accused did so in a certain manner. Conniving at fighting a duel.That certain persons intended to and were about to engage in a duel;That the accused had knowledge of the planned duel; and That the accused connived at the fighting of the duel in a certain manner. Failure to report a duel.That a challenge to fight a duel had been sent or was about to be sent; That the accused had knowledge of this challenge; and That the accused failed to report this fact promptly to properauthority. Explanation.Duel.A duel is combat between two persons for private reasons foughtwith deadly weapons by prior agreement. Promoting a duel.Urging or taunting another to challenge or to accept a challengeto duel, acting as a second or as carrier of a challenge or acceptance,or otherwise furthering or contributing to the fighting of a duel are examplesof promoting a duel. Conniving at fighting a duel.Anyone who has knowledge that steps are being taken or have been taken toward arranging or fighting a duel and who fails to take reasonablepreventive action thereby connives at the fighting of a duel. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

Article 115-MalingeringText of statute. 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who for thepurpose of avoiding work, duty, or service- ****feigns illness, physical disablement, mental lapse or derangement;or ****intentionally inflicts self-injury;

shall be punished as a court-martialmay direct. **Elements.That the accused was assigned to, or was aware of prospective assignmentto, or availability for, the performance of work, duty, or service; That the accused feigned illness, physical disablement, mental lapse or derangement, or intentionally inflicted injury upon himself or herself;and That the accused's purpose or intent in doing so was to avoid the work, duty, or service.--LSQP--Note: If the offense was committed in time of war or in ahostile fire pay zone, add the following element--RSQP--That the offense was committed (in time of war) (in a hostile fire pay zone). Explanation.Nature of offense.The essence of this offense is the design to avoid performance ofany work, duty, or service which may properly or normally be expected ofone in the military service. Whether to avoid all duty, or only a particularjob, it is the purpose to shirk which characterizes the offense. Hence,the nature or permanency of a self-inflicted injury is not material on thequestion of guilt, nor is the seriousness of a physical or mental disabilitywhich is a sham. Evidence of the extent of the self-inflicted injury orfeigned disability may, however, be relevant as a factor indicating the presenceor absence of the purpose. How injury inflicted.The injury may be inflicted by nonviolent as well as by violentmeans and may be accomplished by any act or omission which produces, prolongs,or aggravates any sickness or disability. Thus, voluntary starvation whichresults in debility is a self-inflicted injury and when done for the purposeof avoiding work, duty, or service constitutes a violation of this article.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Feigning illness, physical disablement, mental lapse, or derangement.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.

 **Any person subject to this chapter whocauses or participates in any riot or breach of the peace shall be punishedas a court-martial may direct.** Elements.Riot.That the accused was a member of an assembly of three or more persons;That the accused and at least two other members of this group mutuallyintended to assist one another against anyone who might oppose them in doingan act for some private purpose; That the group or some of its members, in furtherance of such purpose,unlawfully committed a tumultuous disturbance of the peace in a violent orturbulent manner; and That these acts terrorized the public in general in that they caused or were intended to cause public alarm or terror. Breach of the peace.That the accused caused or participated in a certain act of a violent or turbulent nature; and That the peace was thereby unlawfully disturbed. Explanation.Riot."Riot" is a tumultuous disturbance of the peace by three or more persons assembled together in furtherance of a common purpose toexecute some enterprise of a private nature by concerted action againstanyone who might oppose them, committed in such a violent and turbulent manner as to cause or be calculated to cause public terror. The gravamen of theoffense of riot is terrorization of the public. It is immaterial whether the act intended was lawful. Furthermore, it is not necessary that the common purpose be determined before the assembly. It is sufficient if the assemblybegins to execute in a tumultuous manner a common purpose formed after itassembled. Breach of the peace.A "breach of the peace" is an unlawful disturbance ofthe peace by an outward demonstration of a violent or turbulent nature.The acts or conduct contemplated by this article are those which disturbthe public tranquility or impinge upon the peace and good order to whichthe community is entitled. Engaging in an affray and unlawful dischargeof firearms in a public street are examples of conduct which may constitutea breach of the peace. Loud speech and unruly conduct may also constitutea breach of the peace by the speaker. A speaker may also by guilty of causinga breach of the peace if the speaker uses language which can reasonably beexpected to produce a violent or turbulent response and a breach of the peaceresults. The fact that the words are true or used under provocation is nota defense, nor is tumultuous conduct excusable because incited by others.Community and public."Community" and "public" include a military organization, post, camp, ship, aircraft, or station.

--LSQP--Note: This statute was amended by Public Law 112-81 (FY12 NDAA), effective 28 June 2012, to reflect the modified names of sexual offenses in Articles 120 and 120b.--RSQP--Elements.Premeditated murder.That a certain named or described person is dead; That the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;That the killing was unlawful; and That, at the time of the killing, the accused had a premeditated design to kill. Intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.That a certain named or described person is dead; That the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;That the killing was unlawful; and That, at the time of the killing, the accused had the intent tokill or inflict great bodily harm upon a person. Act inherently dangerous to another.That a certain named or described person is dead; That the death resulted from the intentional act of the accused;That this act was inherently dangerous to another and showed a wanton disregard for human life; That the accused knew that death or great bodily harm was a probable consequence of the act; and That the killing was unlawful. During certain offenses.That a certain named or described person is dead; That the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;That the killing was unlawful; and That, at the time of the killing, the accused was engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of burglary, sodomy, rape, rape of a child, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, aggravated sexual abuse of a child, aggravated sexual contact with a child, robbery, or aggravated arson.Explanation.In general.Killing a human being is unlawful when done without justificationor excuse. _See_ R.C.M. 916. Whether an unlawful killing constitutesmurder or a lesser offense depends upon the circumstances. The offense iscommitted at the place of the act or omission although the victim may havedied elsewhere. Whether death occurs at the time of the accused's act oromission, or at some time thereafter, it must have followed from an injury received by the victim which resulted from the act or omission. Premeditated murder.Premeditation.A murder is not premeditated unless the thought of taking life was consciously conceived and the act or omission by which it was taken wasintended. Premeditated murder is murder committed after the formation ofa specific intent to kill someone and consideration of the act intended.It is not necessary that the intention to kill have been entertained forany particular or considerable length of time. When a fixed purpose to killhas been deliberately formed, it is immaterial how soon afterwards it isput into execution. The existence of premeditation may be inferred from thecircumstances. Transferred premeditation.When an accused with a premeditated design attempted to unlawfully kill a certain person, but, by mistake or inadvertence, killed another person,the accused is still criminally responsible for a premeditated murder, becausethe premeditated design to kill is transferred from the intended victim tothe actual victim. Intoxication.Voluntary intoxication (_see_ R.C.M.916(1)(2)) not amounting to legal insanity may reduce premeditatedmurder (Article 118(1)) to unpremeditated murder (Article 118(2) or (3))but it does not reduce either premeditated murder or unpremeditated murderto manslaughter (Article 119) or any other lesser offense. Intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.Intent.An unlawful killing without premeditation is also murder when the accused had either an intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm. It maybe inferred that a person intends the natural and probable consequencesof an act purposely done. Hence, if a person does an intentional act likelyto result in death or great bodily injury, it may be inferred that deathor great bodily injury was intended. The intent need not be directed towardthe person killed, or exist for any particular time before commission ofthe act, or have previously existed at all. It is sufficient that it existedat the time of the act or omission (except if death is inflicted in theheat of a sudden passion caused by adequate provocation- _see_ paragraph 44). For example, a person committing housebreaking whostrikes and kills the householder attempting to prevent flight can be guiltyof murder even if the householder was not seen until the moment before striking the fatal blow. Great bodily harm."Great bodily harm" means serious injury; it does not include minor injuries such as a black eye or a bloody nose, but it doesinclude fractured or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members of the body, serious damage to internal organs, and other serious bodily injuries. Itis synonymous with the term "grievous bodily harm." Intoxication.Voluntary intoxication not amounting to legal insanity does not reduce unpremeditated murder to manslaughter (Article 119) or any otherlesser offense. Act inherently dangerous to others.Wanton disregard of human life.Intentionally engaging in an act inherently dangerous to another-althoughwithout an intent to cause the death of or great bodily harm to any particularperson, or even with a wish that death will not be caused-may alsoconstitute murder if the act shows wanton disregard of human life. Such disregard is characterized by heedlessness of the probable consequences of the actor omission, or indifference to the likelihood of death or great bodilyharm. Examples include throwing a live grenade toward another in jest or flying an aircraft very low over one or more persons to cause alarm. Knowledge.The accused must know that death or great bodily harm was a probable consequence of the inherently dangerous act. Such knowledge may be provedby circumstantial evidence. During certain offenses.In general.The commission or attempted commission of any of the offenses listed in Article 118(4) is likely to result in homicide, and when an unlawfulkilling occurs as a consequence of the perpetration or attempted perpetrationof one of these offenses, the killing is murder. Under these circumstancesit is not a defense that the killing was unintended or accidental. Separate offenses.The perpetration or attempted perpetration of the burglary, forcible sodomy, rape, robbery, or aggravated arson may be charged separately from the homicide.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Article 118(1) or (4)-death. Mandatory minimum-imprisonmentfor life with eligibility for parole. Article 118(2) or (3)-such punishment other than death asa court-martial may direct. Sample specification.

Article 119-ManslaughterText of statute.**Any person subject to this chapter who, with an intent to killor inflict great bodily harm, unlawfully kills a human being in the heatof sudden passion caused by adequate provocation is guilty of voluntarymanslaughter and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.****Any person subject to this chapter who, without an intent to killor inflict great bodily harm, unlawfully kills a human being-****by culpable negligence; or****while perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate an offense, other than those named in clause (4) of section 918 of this title (article 118),directly affecting the person;

is guilty of involuntary manslaughter andshall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**Elements.Voluntary manslaughter.That a certain named or described person is dead; That the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;That the killing was unlawful; and That, at the time of the killing, the accused had the intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm upon the person killed.--LSQP--Note: Add the following if applicable--RSQP-- That the person killed was a child under the age of 16 years. Involuntary manslaughter.That a certain named or described person is dead; That the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;That the killing was unlawful; and That this act or omission of the accused constituted culpable negligence, or occurred while the accused was perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate an offense directly affecting the person other than burglary, forcible sodomy, rape, robbery, or aggravated arson.--LSQP--Note: Add the following if applicable--RSQP-- That the person killed was a child under the age of 16 years. Explanation.Voluntary manslaughter.Nature of offense.An unlawful killing, although done with an intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm, is not murder but voluntary manslaughter if committedin the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation. Heat of passionmay result from fear or rage. A person may be provoked to such an extentthat in the heat of sudden passion caused by the provocation, although notin necessary defense of life or to prevent bodily harm, a fatal blow maybe struck before self-control has returned. Although adequate provocationdoes not excuse the homicide, it does preclude conviction of murder. Nature of provocation.The provocation must be adequate to excite uncontrollable passionin a reasonable person, and the act of killing must be committed under andbecause of the passion. However, the provocation must not be sought or inducedas an excuse for killing or doing harm. If, judged by the standard of a reasonableperson, sufficient cooling time elapses between the provocation and the killing,the offense is murder, even if the accused's passion persists. Examplesof acts which may, depending on the circumstances, constitute adequate provocationare the unlawful infliction of great bodily harm, unlawful imprisonment,and the sight by one spouse of an act of adultery committed by the otherspouse. Insulting or abusive words or gestures, a slight blow with the handor fist, and trespass or other injury to property are not, standing alone,adequate provocation. When committed upon a child under 16 years of age. The maximum punishment is increased when voluntary manslaughter is committed upon a child under 16 years of age. The accused's knowledge that the child was under 16 years of age at the time of the offense is not required for the increased maximum punishment. Involuntary manslaughter.Culpable negligence.Nature of culpable negligence.Culpable negligence is a degree of carelessness greater than simple negligence. It is a negligent act or omission accompanied by a culpabledisregard for the foreseeable consequences to others of that act or omission.Thus, the basis of a charge of involuntary manslaughter may be a negligentact or omission which, when viewed in the light of human experience, mightforeseeably result in the death of another, even though death would notnecessarily be a natural and probable consequence of the act or omission.Acts which may amount to culpable negligence include negligently conductingtarget practice so that the bullets go in the direction of an inhabitedhouse within range; pointing a pistol in jest at another and pulling thetrigger, believing, but without taking reasonable precautions to ascertain,that it would not be dangerous; and carelessly leaving poisons or dangerousdrugs where they may endanger life. Legal duty required.When there is no legal duty to act there can be no neglect. Thus, when a stranger makes no effort to save a drowning person, or a person allowsa beggar to freeze or starve to death, no crime is committed. Offense directly affecting the person.An "offense directly affecting the person" means one affecting some particular person as distinguished from an offense affectingsociety in general. Among offenses directly affecting the person are thevarious types of assault, battery, false imprisonment, voluntary engagementin an affray, and maiming. When committed upon a child under 16 years of age. The maximum punishment is increased when involuntary manslaughter is committed upon a child under 16 years of age. The accused's knowledge that the child was under 16 years of age at the time of the offense is not required for the increased maximum punishment.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

This article makes it a separate, punishable crime to cause the death of or bodily injury to an unborn child while engaged in arson (article 126, UCMJ); murder (article 118, UCMJ); voluntary manslaughter (article 119(a), UCMJ); involuntary manslaughter (article 119(b)(2), UCMJ); rape (article 120(a), UCMJ); robbery (article 122, UCMJ); maiming (article 124, UCMJ); or assault (article 128, UCMJ) against a pregnant woman. For all underlying offenses, except arson, this article requires that the victim of the underlying offense be the pregnant mother. For purposes of arson, the pregnant mother must have some nexus to the arson such that she sustained some "bodily injury" due to the arson. For the purposes of this article the term "woman" means a female of any age. This article does not permit the prosecution of any-person for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the pregnant woman, or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf, has been obtained or for which such consent is implied by law;person for any medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child; orwoman with respect to her unborn child.The offenses of "injuring an unborn child" and "killing an unborn child" do not require proof that-the person engaging in the conduct (the accused) had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; orthe accused intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.The offense of "attempting to kill an unborn child" requires that the accused intended by his conduct to cause the death of the unborn child (See paragraph b(3)(c) above).Bodily injury. For the purpose of this offense, the term "bodily injury" is that which is provided by section 1365 of title 18, to wit: a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, or disfigurement; physical pain; illness; impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary.Unborn child. "Unborn child" means a child in utero or a member of the species homo sapiens who is carried in the womb, at any stage of development, from conception to birth.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for (1) Injuring an unborn child; (2) Killing an unborn child; (3) Attempting to kill an unborn child; or (4) Intentionally killing an unborn child is such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct, but shall be consistent with the punishment had the bodily injury, death, attempt to kill, or intentional killing occurred to the unborn child's mother.Sample specifications.Injuring an unborn child.

It is not a defense that the accused reasonably believed that the child had attained the age of 12 years.****_Under 16 years_. In a prosecution under this section, it need not be proven that the accused knew that the other person engaging in the sexual act or lewd act had not attained the age of 16 years, but it is a defense in a prosecution under subsection (b) (sexual assault of a child) or subsection (c) (sexual abuse of a child), which the accused must prove by a preponderance of the evidence, that the accused reasonably believed that the child had attained the age of 16 years, if the child had in fact attained at least the age of 12 years.****_Proof of Threat_.

Wrongful appropriation.That the accused wrongfully took, obtained, or withheld certain property from the possession of the owner or of any other person; That the property belonged to a certain person; That the property was of a certain value, or of some value; andThat the taking, obtaining, or withholding by the accused was with the intent temporarily to deprive or defraud another person of the use andbenefit of the property or temporarily to appropriate the property for theuse of the accused or for any person other than the owner. Explanation.Larceny.In general.A wrongful taking with intent permanently to deprive includes the common law offense of larceny; a wrongful obtaining with intent permanentlyto defraud includes the offense formerly known as obtaining by false pretense;and a wrongful withholding with intent permanently to appropriate includesthe offense formerly known as embezzlement. Any of the various types of larcenyunder Article 121 may be charged and proved under a specification allegingthat the accused "did steal" the property in question. Taking, obtaining, or withholding.There must be a taking, obtaining, or withholding of the propertyby the thief. For instance, there is no taking if the property is connectedto a building by a chain and the property has not been disconnected fromthe building; property is not "obtained" by merely acquiringtitle thereto without exercising some possessory control over it. As a generalrule, however, any movement of the property or any exercise of dominionover it is sufficient if accompanied by the requisite intent. Thus, if anaccused enticed another's horse into the accused's stable without touchingthe animal, or procured a railroad company to deliver another's trunk bychanging the check on it, or obtained the delivery of another's goods toa person or place designated by the accused, or had the funds of anothertransferred to the accused's bank account, the accused is guilty of larcenyif the other elements of the offense have been proved. A person may "obtain" the property of another by acquiring possession without title, and one who already has possession of the property of another may "obtain"it by later acquiring title to it. A "withholding" may ariseas a result of a failure to return, account for, or deliver property to itsowner when a return, accounting, or delivery is due, even if the owner hasmade no demand for the property, or it may arise as a result of devotingproperty to a use not authorized by its owner. Generally, this is so whether the person withholding the property acquired it lawfully or unlawfully. _See_ subparagraph c(1)(f) below. However, acts which constitute theoffense of unlawfully receiving, buying, or concealing stolen property orof being an accessory after the fact are not included within the meaning of "withholds." Therefore, neither a receiver of stolen propertynor an accessory after the fact can be convicted of larceny on that basisalone. The taking, obtaining, or withholding must be of specific property.A debtor does not withhold specific property from the possession of a creditorby failing or refusing to pay a debt, for the relationship of debtor andcreditor does not give the creditor a possessory right in any specific moneyor other property of the debtor. Ownership of the property.In general.Article 121 requires that the taking, obtaining, or withholdingbe from the possession of the owner or of any other person. Care, custody,management, and control are among the definitions of possession. Owner."Owner" refers to the person who, at the time of the taking, obtaining, or withholding, had the superior right to possessionof the property in the light of all conflicting interests therein whichmay be involved in the particular case. For instance, an organization is the true owner of its funds as against the custodian of the funds charged withthe larceny thereof. Any other person."Any other person" means any person-even a person who has stolen the property-who has possession or a greater rightto possession than the accused. In pleading a violation of this article,the ownership of the property may be alleged to have been in any person,other than the accused, who at the time of the theft was a general owneror a special owner thereof. A general owner of property is a person who hastitle to it, whether or not that person has possession of it; a special owner,such as a borrower or hirer, is one who does not have title but who doeshave possession, or the right of possession, of the property. Person."Person," as used in referring to one from whose possessionproperty has been taken, obtained, or withheld, and to any owner of property,includes (in addition to a natural person) a government, a corporation,an association, an organization, and an estate. Such a person need not bea legal entity. Wrongfulness of the taking, obtaining, or withholding.The taking, obtaining, or withholding of the property must be wrongful.As a general rule, a taking or withholding of property from the possessionof another is wrongful if done without the consent of the other, and anobtaining of property from the possession of another is wrongful if the obtainingis by false pretense. However, such an act is not wrongful if it is authorizedby law or apparently lawful superior orders, or, generally, if done by aperson who has a right to the possession of the property either equal toor greater than the right of one from whose possession the property is taken,obtained, or withheld. An owner of property who takes or withholds it fromthe possession of another, without the consent of the other, or who obtainsit therefrom by false pretense, does so wrongfully if the other has a superior right-such as a lien-to possession of the property. A personwho takes, obtains, or withholds property as the agent of another has the same rights and liabilities as does the principal, but may not be chargedwith a guilty knowledge or intent of the principal which that person doesnot share. False pretense.With respect to obtaining property by false pretense, the false pretense may be made by means of any act, word, symbol, or token. The pretensemust be in fact false when made and when the property is obtained, and itmust be knowingly false in the sense that it is made without a belief inits truth. A false pretense is a false representation of past or existingfact. In addition to other kinds of facts, the fact falsely representedby a person may be that person's or another's power, authority, or intention.Thus, a false representation by a person that person presently intends toperform a certain act in the future is a false representation of an existingfact-the intention-and thus a false pretense. Although the pretenseneed not be the sole cause inducing the owner to part with the property,it must be an effective and intentional cause of the obtaining. A false representationmade after the property was obtained will not result in a violation of Article121. A larceny is committed when a person obtains the property of anotherby false pretense and with intent to steal, even though the owner neitherintended nor was requested to part with title to the property. Thus, a personwho gets another's watch by pretending that it will be borrowed brieflyand then returned, but who really intends to sell it, is guilty of larceny.Intent.In general.The offense of larceny requires that the taking, obtaining, orwithholding by the thief be accompanied by an intent permanently to depriveor defraud another of the use and benefit of property or permanently toappropriate the property to the thief's own use or the use of any person other than the owner. These intents are collectively called an intent to steal.Although a person gets property by a taking or obtaining which was not wrongfulor which was without a concurrent intent to steal, a larceny is neverthelesscommitted if an intent to steal is formed after the taking or obtaining andthe property is wrongfully withheld with that intent. For example, if aperson rents another's vehicle, later decides to keep it permanently, and then either fails to return it at the appointed time or uses it for a purpose not authorized by the terms of the rental, larceny has been committed, eventhough at the time the vehicle was rented, the person intended to returnit after using it according to the agreement. Inference of intent.An intent to steal may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Thus,if a person secretly takes property, hides it, and denies knowing anythingabout it, an intent to steal may be inferred; if the property was takenopenly and returned, this would tend to negate such an intent. Proof of saleof the property may show an intent to steal, and therefore, evidence of sucha sale may be introduced to support a charge of larceny. An intent to stealmay be inferred from a wrongful and intentional dealing with the propertyof another in a manner likely to cause that person to suffer a permanentloss thereof. Special situations.Motive does not negate intent.The accused's purpose in taking an item ordinarily is irrelevantto the accused's guilt as long as the accused had the intent required undersubparagraph c(1)(f)(i) above. For example, if the accused wrongfully tookproperty as a "joke" or "to teach the owner a lesson"this would not be a defense, although if the accused intended to return theproperty, the accused would be guilty of wrongful appropriation, not larceny.When a person takes property intending only to return it to its lawful owner,as when stolen property is taken from a thief in order to return it to itsowner, larceny or wrongful appropriation is not committed. Intent to pay for or replace property not a defense.An intent to pay for or replace the stolen property is not a defense, even if that intent existed at the time of the theft. If, however, the accusedtakes money or a negotiable instrument having no special value above itsface value, with the intent to return an equivalent amount of money, theoffense of larceny is not committed although wrongful appropriation may be.Return of property not a defense. Once a larceny is committed, a return of the property or paymentfor it is no defense. _See_ subparagraph c(2) below when thetaking, obtaining, or withholding is with the intent to return. Value.In general.Value is a question of fact to be determined on the basis of allof the evidence admitted. Government property.When the stolen property is an item issued or procured from Governmentsources, the price listed in an official publication for that property atthe time of the theft is admissible as evidence of its value. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 803(17). However, the stolen item must be shown tohave been, at the time of the theft, in the condition upon which the valueindicated in the official price list is based. The price listed in the officialpublication is not conclusive as to the value of the item, and other evidencemay be admitted on the question of its condition and value. Other property.As a general rule, the value of other stolen property is its legitimatemarket value at the time and place of the theft. If this property, becauseof its character or the place where it was stolen, had no legitimate marketvalue at the time and place of the theft or if that value cannot readilybe ascertained, its value may be determined by its legitimate market valuein the United States at the time of the theft, or by its replacement costat that time, whichever is less. Market value may be established by proofof the recent purchase price paid for the article in the legitimate market involved or by testimony or other admissible evidence from any person whois familiar through training or experience with the market value in question.The owner of the property may testify as to its market value if familiarwith its quality and condition. The fact that the owner is not an expertof the market value of the property goes only to the weight to be giventhat testimony, and not to its admissibility. _ See_ Mil. R.Evid. 701. When the character of the property clearly appears in evidence-forinstance, when it is exhibited to the court-martial-the court-martial,from its own experience, may infer that it has some value. If as a matter of common knowledge the property is obviously of a value substantially in excess of $500.00, the court-martial may find a value of more than $500.00.Writings representing value may be considered to have the value-even though contingent-which they represented at the time of the theft.Limited interest in property.If an owner of property or someone acting in the owner's behalf steals it from a person who has a superior, but limited, interest in theproperty, such as a lien, the value for punishment purposes shall be thatof the limited interest. Military Property.Military property is all property, real or personal, owned, held, or used by one of the armed forces of the United States. Military property is a term of art, and should not be confused with government property. The terms are not interchangeable. While all military property is government property, not all government property is military property. An item of government property is not military property unless the item in question meets the definition provided above. Retail merchandise of service exchange stores is not military property under this article.Miscellaneous considerations.Lost property.A taking or withholding of lost property by the finder is larcenyif accompanied by an intent to steal and if a clue to the identity of thegeneral or special owner, or through which such identity may be traced,is furnished by the character, location, or marketing of the property, orby other circumstances. Multiple article larceny.When a larceny of several articles is committed at substantiallythe same time and place, it is a single larceny even though the articlesbelong to different persons. Thus, if a thief steals a suitcase containing the property of several persons or goes into a room and takes property belongingto various persons, there is but one larceny, which should be alleged inbut one specification. Special kinds of property which may also be the subject of larceny.Included in property which may be the subject of larceny is property which is taken, obtained, or withheld by severing it from real estate andwritings which represent value such as commercial paper. Services.Theft of services may not be charged under this paragraph, but_ see_ paragraph 78.  Credit, Debit, and Electronic Transactions.Wrongfully engaging in a credit, debit, or electronic transactionto obtain goods or money is an obtaining-type larceny by false pretense. Such use to obtain goods is usually a larceny of those goods from the merchantoffering them. Such use to obtain money or a negotiable instrument (e.g.,withdrawing cash from an automated teller or a cash advance from a bank)is usually a larceny of money from the entity presenting the money or anegotiable instrument. For the purpose of this section, the term 'credit,debit, or electronic transaction' includes the use of an instrumentor device, whether known as a credit card, debit card, automated tellermachine (ATM) card or by any other name, including access devices such ascode, account number, electronic serial number or personal identificationnumber, issued for the use in obtaining money, goods, or anything else ofvalue. Wrongful appropriation.In general.Wrongful appropriation requires an intent to temporarily-as opposed to permanently-deprive the owner of the use and benefit of,or appropriate to the use of another, the property wrongfully taken, withheld,or obtained. In all other respects wrongful appropriation and larceny areidentical. Examples.Wrongful appropriation includes: taking another's automobile without permission or lawful authority with intent to drive it a short distanceand then return it or cause it to be returned to the owner; obtaining aservice weapon by falsely pretending to be about to go on guard duty with intent to use it on a hunting trip and later return it; and while drivinga government vehicle on a mission to deliver supplies, withholding the vehiclefrom government service by deviating from the assigned route without authority,to visit a friend in a nearby town and later restore the vehicle to its lawfuluse. An inadvertent exercise of control over the property of another willnot result in wrongful appropriation. For example, a person who fails toreturn a borrowed boat at the time agreed upon because the boat inadvertentlywent aground is not guilty of this offense.

 **Any person subject to this chapter whowith intent to steal takes anything of value from the person or in the presenceof another, against his will, by means of force or violence or fear of immediateor future injury to his person or property or to the person or property ofa relative or member of his family or of anyone in his company at the timeof the robbery, is guilty of robbery and shall be punished as a court-martialmay direct.** Elements.That the accused wrongfully took certain property from the personor from the possession and in the presence of a person named or described;That the taking was against the will of that person; That the taking was by means of force, violence, or force and violence,or putting the person in fear of immediate or future injury to that person,a relative, a member of the person's family, anyone accompanying the personat the time of the robbery, the person's property, or the property of arelative, family member, or anyone accompanying the person at the time ofthe robbery; That the property belonged to a person named or described; That the property was of a certain or of some value; and That the taking of the property by the accused was with the intent permanently to deprive the person robbed of the use and benefit of the property.--LSQP--Note: If the robbery was committed with a firearm, add the following element--RSQP-- That the means of force or violence or of putting the person infear was a firearm. Explanation.Taking in the presence of the victim.It is not necessary that the property taken be located within any certain distance of the victim. If persons enter a house and force the ownerby threats to disclose the hiding place of valuables in an adjoining room,and, leaving the owner tied, go into that room and steal the valuables, theyhave committed robbery. Force or violence.For a robbery to be committed by force or violence, there must be actual force or violence to the person, preceding or accompanying the takingagainst the person's will, and it is immaterial that there is no fear engenderedin the victim. Any amount of force is enough to constitute robbery if theforce overcomes the actual resistance of the person robbed, puts the personin such a position that no resistance is made, or suffices to overcome theresistance offered by a chain or other fastening by which the article isattached to the person. The offense is not robbery if an article is merely snatched from the hand of another or a pocket is picked by stealth, no otherforce is used, and the owner is not put in fear. But if resistance is overcomein snatching the article, there is sufficient violence, as when an earringis torn from a person's ear. There is sufficient violence when a person'sattention is diverted by being jostled by a confederate of a pickpocket,who is thus enabled to steal the person's watch, even though the person hadno knowledge of the act; or when a person is knocked insensible and thatperson's pockets rifled; or when a guard steals property from the personof a prisoner in the guard's charge after handcuffing the prisoner on thepretext of preventing escape. Fear.For a robbery to be committed by putting the victim in fear, there need be no actual force or violence, but there must be a demonstration offorce or menace by which the victim is placed in such fear that the victimis warranted in making no resistance. The fear must be a reasonable apprehensionof present or future injury, and the taking must occur while the apprehensionexists. The injury apprehended may be death or bodily injury to the personor to a relative or family member, or to anyone in the person's company atthe time, or it may be the destruction of the person's habitation or otherproperty or that of a relative or family member or anyone in the person'scompany at the time of sufficient gravity to warrant giving up the propertydemanded by the assailant. Larceny by taking.Robbery includes "taking with intent to steal"; hence,a larceny by taking is an integral part of a charge of robbery and mustbe proved at the trial. _ See_ paragraph 46c(1). Multiple-victim robberies.Robberies of different persons at the same time and place are separateoffenses and each such robbery should be alleged in a separate specification.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, withintent to defraud-****falsely makes or alters any signature to, or any part of, any writing which would, if genuine, apparently impose a legal liability on another orchange his legal right or liability to his prejudice; or****utters, offers, issues, or transfers such a writing, known by himto be so made or altered; is guilty of forgery and shall be punished as acourt-martial may direct.**Elements.Forgery-making or altering.That the accused falsely made or altered a certain signature orwriting; That the signature or writing was of a nature which would, if genuine,apparently impose a legal liability on another or change another's legalrights or liabilities to that person's prejudice; andThat the false making or altering was with the intent to defraud.Forgery-uttering.That a certain signature or writing was falsely made or altered;That the signature or writing was of a nature which would, if genuine,apparently impose a legal liability on another or change another's legalrights or liabilities to that person's prejudice; That the accused uttered, offered, issued, or transferred the signatureor writing; That at such time the accused knew that the signature or writinghad been falsely made or altered; and That the uttering, offering, issuing or transferring was with theintent to defraud. Explanation.In general.Forgery may be committed either by falsely making a writing or byknowingly uttering a falsely made writing. There are three elements commonto both aspects of forgery: a writing falsely made or altered; and apparentcapability of the writing as falsely made or altered to impose a legal liabilityon another or to change another's legal rights or liabilities to that person'sprejudice; and an intent to defraud. False."False" refers not to the contents of the writing orto the facts stated therein but to the making or altering of it. Hence,forgery is not committed by the genuine making of a false instrument evenwhen made with intent to defraud. A person who, with intent to defraud, signsthat person's own signature as the maker of a check drawn on a bank in whichthat person does not have money or credit does not commit forgery. Althoughthe check falsely represents the existence of the account, it is what itpurports to be, a check drawn by the actual maker, and therefore it is notfalsely made. _ See_, however, paragraph 49. Likewise, ifa person makes a false signature of another to an instrument, but adds theword "by" with that person's own signature thus indicating authorityto sign, the offense is not forgery even if no such authority exists. Falserecitals of fact in a genuine document, as an aircraft flight report whichis "padded" by the one preparing it, do not make the writinga forgery. _But see_ paragraph 31 concerning false officialstatements. Signatures.Signing the name of another to an instrument having apparent legal efficacy without authority and with intent to defraud is forgery as thesignature is falsely made. The distinction is that in this case the falselymade signature purports to be the act of one other than the actual signer.Likewise, a forgery may be committed by a person signing that person's ownname to an instrument. For example, when a check payable to the order ofa certain person comes into the hands of another of the same name, forgeryis committed if, knowing the check to be another's, that person indorsesit with that person's own name intending to defraud. Forgery may also becommitted by signing a fictitious name, as when Roe makes a check payable to Roe and signs it with a fictitious name-Doe-as drawer. Nature of writing.The writing must be one which would, if genuine, apparently imposea legal liability on another, as a check or promissory note, or change thatperson's legal rights or liabilities to that person's prejudice, as a receipt.Some other instruments which may be the subject of forgery are orders forthe delivery of money or goods, railroad tickets, and military orders directingtravel. A writing falsely "made" includes an instrument thatmay be partially or entirely printed, engraved, written with a pencil, ormade by photography or other device. A writing may be falsely "made"by materially altering an existing writing, by filling in a paper signedin blank, or by signing an instrument already written. With respect to the apparent legal efficacy of the writing falsely made or altered, the writing must appear either on its face or from extrinsic facts to impose a legalliability on another, or to change a legal right or liability to the prejudiceof another. If under all the circumstances the instrument has neither realnor apparent legal efficacy, there is no forgery. Thus, the false makingwith intent to defraud of an instrument affirmatively invalid on its faceis not forgery nor is the false making or altering, with intent to defraud,of a writing which could not impose a legal liability, as a mere letter ofintroduction. However, the false making of another's signature on an instrumentwith intent to defraud is forgery, even if there is no resemblance to thegenuine signature and the name is misspelled. Intent to defraud. _See_ paragraph 49c(14). The intent to defraud neednot be directed toward anyone in particular nor be for the advantage ofthe offender.It is immaterial that nobody was actually defrauded, or thatno further step was made toward carrying out the intent to defraud otherthan the false making or altering of a writing. Alteration.The alteration must effect a material change in the legal tenorof the writing. Thus, an alteration which apparently increases, diminishes,or discharges any obligation is material. Examples of material alterations in the case of a promissory note are changing the date, amount, or placeof payment. If a genuine writing has been delivered to the accused and whilein the accused's possession is later found to be altered, it may be inferredthat the writing was altered by the accused. Uttering. _See_ paragraph 49c(4). Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years. Sample specifications.Forgery-making or altering.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who-****for the procurement of any article or thing of value, with intent to defraud; or** **for the payment of any past due obligation, or for any other purpose, with intent to deceive; makes, draws, utters, or delivers any check,draft, or order for the payment of money upon any bank or other depository,knowing at the time that the maker or drawer has not or will not have sufficientfunds in, or credit with, the bank or other depository for the payment ofthat check, draft, or order in full upon its presentment, shall be punishedas a court-martial may direct. The making, drawing, uttering, or deliveringby a maker or drawer of a check, draft, or order, payment of which is refusedby the drawee because of insufficient funds of the maker or drawer in thedrawee's possession or control, is prima facie evidence of his intent todefraud or deceive and of his knowledge of insufficient funds in, or creditwith, that bank or other depository, unless the maker or drawer pays theholder the amount due within five days after receiving notice, orally orin writing, that the check, draft, or order was not paid on presentment.In this section, the word "credit" means an arrangement or understanding,express or implied, with the bank or other depository for the payment ofthat check, draft, or order.** Elements.For the procurement of any article or thing of value, with intent to defraud.That the accused made, drew, uttered, or delivered a check, draft,or order for the payment of money payable to a named person or organization;That the accused did so for the purpose of procuring an articleor thing of value; That the act was committed with intent to defraud; and That at the time of making, drawing, uttering, or delivery of the instrument the accused knew that the accused or the maker or drawer hadnot or would not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bank or otherdepository for the payment thereof upon presentment. For the payment of any past due obligation, or for any other purpose, with intent to deceive.That the accused made, drew, uttered, or delivered a check, draft,or order for the payment of money payable to a named person or organization;That the accused did so for the purpose or purported purpose of effecting the payment of a past due obligation or for some other purpose;That the act was committed with intent to deceive; and That at the time of making, drawing, uttering, or delivering ofthe instrument, the accused knew that the accused or the maker or drawerhad not or would not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bankor other depository for the payment thereof upon presentment. Explanation.Written instruments.The written instruments covered by this article include any check, draft (including share drafts), or order for the payment of money drawnupon any bank or other depository, whether or not the drawer bank or depositoryis actually in existence. It may be inferred that every check, draft, ororder carries with it a representation that the instrument will be paid infull by the bank or other depository upon presentment by a holder when due.Bank or other depository."Bank or other depository" includes any business regularlybut not necessarily exclusively engaged in public banking activities. Making or drawing."Making" and "drawing" are synonymous and refer to the act of writing and signing the instrument. Uttering or delivering."Uttering" and "delivering" have similar meanings. Both mean transferring the instrument to another, but "uttering"has the additional meaning of offering to transfer. A person need not personallybe the maker or drawer of an instrument in order to violate this articleif that person utters or delivers it. For example, if a person holds a checkwhich that person knows is worthless, and utters or delivers the check toanother, that person may be guilty of an offense under this article despitethe fact that the person did not personally draw the check. For the procurement."For the procurement" means for the purpose of obtaining any article or thing of value. It is not necessary that an article or thingof value actually be obtained, and the purpose of the obtaining may be forthe accused's own use or benefit or for the use or benefit of another. For the payment."For the payment" means for the purpose or purported purpose of satisfying in whole or in part any past due obligation. Paymentneed not be legally effected. For any other purpose."For any other purpose" includes all purposes otherthan the payment of a past due obligation or the procurement of any articleor thing of value. For example, it includes paying or purporting to payan obligation which is not yet past due. The check, draft, or order, whether made or negotiated for the procurement of an article or thing of value orfor the payment of a past due obligation or for some other purpose, neednot be intended or represented as payable immediately. For example, themaking of a postdated check, delivered at the time of entering into an installmentpurchase contract and intended as payment for a future installment, would,if made with the requisite intent and knowledge, be a violation of thisarticle. Article or thing of value."Article or thing of value" extends to every kind of right or interest in property, or derived from contract, including interestsand rights which are intangible or contingent or which mature in the future.Past due obligation.A "past due obligation" is an obligation to pay money, which obligation has legally matured before making, drawing, uttering, ordelivering the instrument. Knowledge.The accused must have knowledge, at the time the accused makes, draws, utters, or delivers the instrument, that the maker or drawer, whetherthe accused or another, has not or will not have sufficient funds in, orcredit with, the bank or other depository for the payment of the instrumentin full upon its presentment. Such knowledge may be proved by circumstantialevidence. Sufficient funds."Sufficient funds" refers to a condition in which the account balance of the maker or drawer in the bank or other depository atthe time of the presentment of the instrument for payment is not less thanthe face amount of the instrument and has not been rendered unavailable forpayment by garnishment, attachment, or other legal procedures. Credit."Credit" means an arrangement or understanding, express or implied, with the bank or other depository for the payment of the check,draft, or order. An absence of credit includes those situations in which an accused writes a check on a nonexistent bank or on a bank in which the accused has no account. Upon its presentment."Upon its presentment" refers to the time the demandfor payment is made upon presentation of the instrument to the bank or otherdepository on which it was drawn. Intent to defraud."Intent to defraud" means an intent to obtain, througha misrepresentation, an article or thing of value and to apply it to one'sown use and benefit or to the use and benefit of another, either permanently or temporarily. Intent to deceive."Intent to deceive" means an intent to mislead, cheat,or trick another by means of a misrepresentation made for the purpose ofgaining an advantage for oneself or for a third person, or of bringing abouta disadvantage to the interests of the person to whom the representationwas made or to interests represented by that person. The relationship of time and intent.Under this article, two times are involved: (a) when the accused makes, draws, utters, or delivers the instrument; and (b) when the instrumentis presented to the bank or other depository for payment. With respect to(a), the accused must possess the requisite intent and must know that the maker or drawer does not have or will not have sufficient funds in, or creditwith, the bank or the depository for payment of the instrument in full uponits presentment when due. With respect to (b), if it can otherwise be shownthat the accused possessed the requisite intent and knowledge at the timethe accused made, drew, uttered, or delivered the instrument, neither proofof presentment nor refusal of payment is necessary, as when the instrumentis one drawn on a nonexistent bank. Statutory rule of evidence.The provision of this article with respect to establishing prima facie evidence of knowledge and intent by proof of notice and nonpaymentwithin 5 days is a statutory rule of evidence. The failure of an accusedwho is a maker or drawer to pay the holder the amount due within 5 days afterreceiving either oral or written notice from the holder of a check, draft,or order, or from any other person having knowledge that such check, draft,or order was returned unpaid because of insufficient funds, is prima facieevidence (a) that the accused had the intent to defraud or deceive as alleged;and (b) that the accused knew at the time the accused made, drew, uttered,or delivered the check, draft, or order that the accused did not have orwould not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bank or other depositoryfor the payment of such check, draft, or order upon its presentment forpayment. Prima facie evidence is that evidence from which the accused'sintent to defraud or deceive and the accused's knowledge of insufficient funds in or credit with the bank or other depository may be inferred, dependingon all the circumstances. The failure to give notice referred to in thearticle, or payment by the accused, maker, or drawer to the holder of theamount due within 5 days after such notice has been given, precludes theprosecution from using the statutory rule of evidence but does not precludeconviction of this offense if all the elements are otherwise proved.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, with intentto injure, disfigure, or disable, inflicts upon the person of another aninjury which-** **seriously disfigures his person by any mutilation thereof;****destroys or disables any member or organ of his body; or****seriously diminishes his physical vigor by the injury ofany member or organ; is guilty of maiming and shall be punished as a court-martialmay direct.** Elements.That the accused inflicted a certain injury upon a certain person;That this injury seriously disfigured the person's body, destroyedor disabled an organ or member, or seriously diminished the person's physicalvigor by the injury to an organ or member; and That the accused inflicted this injury with an intent to cause some injury to a person. Explanation.Nature of offense.It is maiming to put out a person's eye, to cut off a hand, foot,or finger, or to knock out a tooth, as these injuries destroy or disablethose members or organs. It is also maiming to injure an internal organso as to seriously diminish the physical vigor of a person. Likewise, itis maiming to cut off an ear or to scar a face with acid, as these injuriesseriously disfigure a person. A disfigurement need not mutilate any entiremember to come within the article, or be of any particular type, but mustbe such as to impair perceptibly and materially the victim's comeliness.The disfigurement, diminishment of vigor, or destruction or disablementof any member or organ must be a serious injury of a substantially permanentnature. However, the offense is complete if such an injury is inflicted eventhough there is a possibility that the victim may eventually recover theuse of the member or organ, or that the disfigurement may be cured by surgery.Means of inflicting injury.To prove the offense it is not necessary to prove the specific means by which the injury was inflicted. However, such evidence may be consideredon the question of intent. Intent.Maiming requires a specific intent to injure generally but not a specific intent to maim. Thus, one commits the offense who intends onlya slight injury, if in fact there is infliction of an injury of the typespecified in this article. Infliction of the type of injuries specified inthis article upon the person of another may support an inference of the intentto injure, disfigure, or disable. Defenses.If the injury is done under circumstances which would justify or excuse homicide, the offense of maiming is not committed. _See_ R.C.M.916.

Maximum punishment.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 20 years.Sample specification.

Structure.That the accused burned or set on fire a certain structure; That the act was willful and malicious; That there was a human being in the structure at the time; That the accused knew that there was a human being in the structure at the time; and That this structure belonged to a certain person and was of a certainvalue. Simple arson.That the accused burned or set fire to certain property of another;That the property was of a certain value; and That the act was willful and malicious. Explanation.In general.In aggravated arson, danger to human life is the essential element; in simple arson, it is injury to the property of another. In either case,it is immaterial that no one is, in fact, injured. It must be shown thatthe accused set the fire willfully and maliciously, that is, not merely bynegligence or accident. Aggravated arson.Inhabited dwelling.An inhabited dwelling includes the outbuildings that form part ofthe cluster of buildings used as a residence. A shop or store is not aninhabited dwelling unless occupied as such, nor is a house that has never been occupied or which has been temporarily abandoned. A person may be guilty of aggravated arson of the person's dwelling, whether as owner or tenant.Structure.Aggravated arson may also be committed by burning or setting onfire any other structure, movable or immovable, such as a theater, church,boat, trailer, tent, auditorium, or any other sort of shelter or edifice, whether public or private, when the offender knows that there is a humanbeing inside at the time. It may be that the offender had this knowledgewhen the nature of the structure-as a department store or theaterduring hours of business, or other circumstances-are shown to havebeen such that a reasonable person would have known that a human being wasinside at the time. Damage to property.It is not necessary that the dwelling or structure be consumed or materially injured; it is enough if fire is actually communicated to anypart thereof. Any actual burning or charring is sufficient, but a mere scorchingor discoloration by heat is not. Value and ownership of property.For the offense of aggravated arson, the value and ownership ofthe dwelling or other structure are immaterial, but should ordinarily bealleged and proved to permit the finding in an appropriate case of the includedoffense of simple arson. Simple arson."Simple arson" is the willful and malicious burningor setting fire to the property of another under circumstances not amountingto aggravated arson. The offense includes burning or setting fire to realor personal property of someone other than the offender. _See also_ paragraph 67 (Burning with intent to defraud).

 **Any person subject to this chapter who communicatesthreats to another person with the intention thereby to obtain anythingof value or any acquittance, advantage, or immunity is guilty of extortion and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.** Elements.That the accused communicated a certain threat to another; andThat the accused intended to unlawfully obtain something of value,or any acquittance, advantage, or immunity. Explanation.In general.Extortion is complete upon communication of the threat with the requisite intent. The actual or probable success of the extortion need notbe proved. Threat.A threat may be communicated by any means but must be received bythe intended victim. The threat may be: a threat to do any unlawful injuryto the person or property of the person threatened or to any member of thatperson's family or any other person held dear to that person; a threat toaccuse the person threatened, or any member of that persons's family or anyother person held dear to that person, of any crime; a threat to exposeor impute any deformity or disgrace to the person threatened or to any memberof that person's family or any other person held dear to that person; a threatto expose any secret affecting the person threatened or any member of thatperson's family or any other person held dear to that person; or a threat to do any other harm. Acquittance.An "acquittance" is a release or discharge from anobligation.

(Note: Add any of the following as applicable)That the weapon was a loaded firearm.That the person was a child under the age of 16 years.Assault in which grievous bodily harm is intentionally inflicted.That the accused assaulted a certain person;That grievous bodily harm was thereby inflicted upon such person;That the grievous bodily harm was done with unlawful force or violence; andThat the accused, at the time, had the specific intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. (Note: Add any of the following as applicable)That the injury was inflicted with a loaded firearm.That the person was a child under the age of 16 years.Explanation.Simple assault.Definition of assault.An "assault" is an attempt or offer with unlawful force or violence to do bodily harm to another, whether or not the attempt oroffer is consummated. It must be done without legal justification or excuseand without the lawful consent of the person affected. "Bodily harm"means any offensive touching of another, however slight. Difference between "attempt" and "offer" typeassaults.Attempt type assault.An "attempt" type assault requires a specific intentto inflict bodily harm, and an overt act-that is, an act that amountsto more than mere preparation and apparently tends to effect the intended bodily harm. An attempt type assault may be committed even though the victimhad no knowledge of the incident at the time. Offer type assault.An "offer" type assault is an unlawful demonstrationof violence, either by an intentional or by a culpably negligent act or omission,which creates in the mind of another a reasonable apprehension of receivingimmediate bodily harm. Specific intent to inflict bodily harm is not required.Examples.If Doe swings a fist at Roe's head intending to hit Roe but misses,Doe has committed an attempt type assault, whether or not Roe is aware ofthe attempt. If Doe swings a fist in the direct of Roe's head either intentionallyor as a result of culpable negligence, and Roe sees the blow coming and isthereby put in apprehension of being struck, Doe has committed an offer typeassault whether or not Doe intended to hit Roe. If Doe swings at Roe's head, intending to hit it, and Roe sees theblow coming and is thereby put in apprehension of being struck, Doe has committedboth on offer and an attempt type assault. If Doe swings at Roe's head simply to frighten Roe, not intendingto hit Roe, and Roe does not see the blow and is not placed in fear, thenno assault of any type has been committed. Situations not amounting to assault.Mere preparation.Preparation not amounting to an overt act, such as picking up astone without any attempt or offer to throw it, does not constitute an assault.Threatening words.The use of threatening words alone does not constitute an assault.However, if the threatening words are accompanied by a menacing act or gesture,there may be an assault, since the combination constitutes a demonstrationof violence. Circumstances negating intent to harm.If the circumstances known to the person menaced clearly negatean intent to do bodily harm there is no assault. Thus, if a person accompaniesan apparent attempt to strike another by an unequivocal announcement in someform of an intention not to strike, there is no assault. For example, if Doeraises a stick and shakes it at Roe within striking distance saying, "Ifyou weren't an old man, I would knock you down," Doe has committedno assault. However, an offer to inflict bodily injury upon another instantly if that person does not comply with a demand which the assailant has no lawfulright to make is an assault. Thus, if Doe points a pistol at Roe and says,"If you don't hand over your watch, I will shoot you," Doe hascommitted an assault upon Roe. _See also_ paragraph 47 (robbery)of this part. Situations not constituting defenses to assault.Assault attempt fails.It is not a defense to a charge of assault that for some reasonunknown to the assailant, an assault attempt was bound to fail. Thus, ifa person loads a rifle with what is believed to be a good cartridge and,pointing it at another, pulls the trigger, that person may be guilty of assaultalthough the cartridge was defective and did not fire. Likewise, if a personin a house shoots through the roof at a place where a policeman is believedto be, that person may be guilty of assault even though the policeman is atanother place on the roof. Retreating victim.An assault is complete if there is a demonstration of violence andan apparent ability to inflict bodily injury causing the person at whom itwas directed to reasonably apprehend that unless the person retreats bodilyharm will be inflicted. This is true even though the victim retreated andwas never within actual striking distance of the assailant. There must, however,be an apparent present ability to inflict the injury. Thus, to aim a pistolat a person at such a distance that it clearly could not injure would notbe an assault. Battery.In general.A "battery" is an assault in which the attempt or offerto do bodily harm is consummated by the infliction of that harm. Application of force.The force applied in a battery may have been directly or indirectlyapplied. Thus, a battery can be committed by inflicting bodily injury ona person through striking the horse on which the person is mounted causingthe horse to throw the person, as well as by striking the person directly.Examples of battery.It may be a battery to spit on another, push a third person against another, set a dog at another which bites the person, cut another's clotheswhile the person is wearing them though without touching or intending totouch the person, shoot a person, cause a person to take poison, or drivean automobile into a person. A person who, although excused in using force,uses more force than is required, commits a battery. Throwing an objectinto a crowd may be a battery on anyone whom the object hits. Situations not constituting battery.If bodily harm is inflicted unintentionally and without culpable negligence, there is no battery. It is also not a battery to touch anotherto attract the other's attention or to prevent injury. Assaults permitting increased punishment based on status of victims.Assault upon a commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer.The maximum punishment is increased when assault is committed upona commissioned officer of the armed forces of the United States, or of afriendly foreign power, or upon a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officerof the armed forces of the United States. Knowledge of the status of thevictim is an essential element of the offense and may be proved by circumstantialevidence. It is not necessary that the victim be superior in rank or commandto the accused, that the victim be in the same armed force, or that the victimbe in the execution of office at the time of the assault. Assault upon a sentinel or lookout in the execution of duty, or upona person in the execution of law enforcement duties.The maximum punishment is increased when assault is committed upona sentinel or lookout in the execution of duty or upon a person who wasthen performing security police, military police, shore patrol, master atarms, or other military or civilian law enforcement duties. Knowledge ofthe status of the victim is an essential element of this offense and maybe proved by circumstantial evidence. _See_ paragraph 38c(4)for the definition of "sentinel or lookout." Assault consummated by a battery upon a child under 16 years of age.The maximum punishment is increased when assault consummated bya battery is committed upon a child under 16 years of age. Knowledge thatthe person assaulted was under 16 years of age is not an element of this offense. Aggravated assault.Assault with a dangerous weapon or other means or force likely toproduce death or grievous bodily harm.Dangerous weapon.A weapon is dangerous when used in a manner likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm. Other means or force.The phrase "other means or force" may include any means or instrumentality not normally considered a weapon. When the natural andprobable consequence of a particular use of any means or force would bedeath or grievous bodily harm, it may be inferred that the means or forceis "likely" to produce that result. The use to which a certainkind of instrument is ordinarily put is irrelevant to the question of itsmethod of employment in a particular case. Thus, a bottle, beer glass, arock, a bunk adaptor, a piece of pipe, a piece of wood, boiling water, drugs,or a rifle butt may be used in a manner likely to inflict death or grievousbodily harm. On the other hand, an unloaded pistol, when presented as a firearmand not as a bludgeon, is not a dangerous weapon or a means of force likelyto produce grievous bodily harm, whether or not the assailant knew it wasunloaded. Grievous bodily harm."Grievous bodily harm" means serious bodily injury.It does not include minor injuries, such as a black eye or a bloody nose,but does include fractured or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn membersof the body, serious damage to internal organs, and other serious bodilyinjuries. Death or injury not required.It is not necessary that death or grievous bodily harm be actually inflicted to prove assault with a dangerous weapon or means likely to producegrievous bodily harm. When committed upon a child under 16 years of age.The maximum punishment is increased when aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon or means likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm is inflicted upon a child under 16 years of age. Knowledge that the person assaulted was under the age of 16 years is not an element of the offense.Assault in which grievous bodily harm is intentionally inflicted.In general.It must be proved that the accused specifically intended to anddid inflict grievous bodily harm. Culpable negligence will not suffice.Proving intent.Specific intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Whengrievous bodily harm has been inflicted by means of intentionally using forcein a manner likely to achieve that result, it may be inferred that grievous bodily harm was intended. On the other hand, that inference might not bedrawn if a person struck another with a fist in a sidewalk fight even ifthe victim fell so that the victim's head hit the curbstone and a skullfracture resulted. It is possible, however, to commit this kind of aggravated assault with the fists, as when the victim is held by one of several assailantswhile the others beat the victim with their fists and break a nose, jaw,or rib. Grievous bodily harm. _See_ subparagraph (4)(a)(iii). When committed on a child under 16 years of age.The maximum punishment is increased when aggravated assault with intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm is inflicted upon a child under 16 years of age. Knowledge that the person assaulted was under the age of 16 years is not an element of the offense.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Simple assault.Generally.Confinement for 3 months and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for 3 months. When committed with an unloaded firearm.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 3 years.

Assault consummated by a battery upon a child under 16 years.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years.

Aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon or other means or force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm when committed upon a child under the age of 16 years.Dishonorable discharge, total forfeitures, and confinement for 5 years.Other cases.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 3 years.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, with intentto commit an offense punishable under sections 918-928 of this title (articles118-128), breaks and enters, in the nighttime, the dwelling house of another,is guilty of burglary and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**Elements.That the accused unlawfully broke and entered the dwelling houseof another; That both the breaking and entering were done in the nighttime;and That the breaking and entering were done with the intent to commitan offense punishable under Article 118 through 128, except Article 123a.Explanation.In general."Burglary" is the breaking and entering in the nighttimeof the dwelling house of another, with intent to commit an offense punishableunder Articles 118 through 128, except 123a. In addition, an intent to commitan offense which, although not covered by Article 118 through 128, necessarilyincludes an offense within one of these articles, satisfies the intent elementof this article. This includes, for example, assaults punishable under Article134 which necessarily include simple assault under Article 128. Breaking.There must be a breaking, actual or constructive. Merely to enter through a hole left in the wall or roof or through an open window or doorwill not constitute a breaking; but if a person moves any obstruction to entry of the house without which movement the person could not have entered, the person has committed a "breaking." Opening a closed dooror window or other similar fixture, opening wider a door or window alreadypartly open but insufficient for the entry, or cutting out the glass of awindow or the netting of a screen is a sufficient breaking. The breakingof an inner door by one who has entered the house without breaking, or bya person lawfully within the house who has no authority to enter the particularroom, is a sufficient breaking, but unless such a breaking is followed byan entry into the particular room with the requisite intent, burglary isnot committed. There is a constructive breaking when the entry is gainedby a trick, such as concealing oneself in a box; under false pretense, suchas impersonating a gas or telephone inspector; by intimidating the occupantsthrough violence or threats into opening the door; through collusion witha confederate, an occupant of the house; or by descending a chimney, evenif only a partial descent is made and no room is entered. Entry.An entry must be effected before the offense is complete, but the entry of any part of the body, even a finger, is sufficient. Insertion intothe house of a tool or other instrument is also a sufficient entry, unlessthe insertion is solely to facilitate the breaking or entry. Nighttime.Both the breaking and entry must be in the nighttime. "Nighttime"is the period between sunset and sunrise when there is not sufficient daylightto discern a person's face. Dwelling house of another.To constitute burglary the house must be the dwelling house ofanother. "Dwelling house" includes outbuildings within the commoninclosure, farmyard, or cluster of buildings used as a residence. Such anarea is the "curtilage." A store is not a dwelling house unlesspart of, or also used as, a dwelling house, as when the occupant uses anotherpart of the same building as a dwelling, or when the store in habituallyslept in by family members or employees. The house must be used as a dwellingat the time of the breaking and entering. It is not necessary that anyoneactually be in it at the time of the breaking and entering, but if the househas never been occupied at all or has been left without any intention ofreturning, it is not a dwelling house. Separate dwellings within the samebuilding, such as a barracks room, apartment, or a room in a hotel, are subjectsof burglary by other residents or guests, and in general by the owner ofthe building. A tent is not a subject of burglary. Intent to commit offense.Both the breaking and entry must be done with the intent to commitin the house an offense punishable under Articles 118 through 128, except123a. If, after the breaking and entering, the accused commits one or moreof these offenses, it may be inferred that the accused intended to committhe offense or offenses at the time of the breaking and entering. If theevidence warrants, the intended offense may be separately charged. It isimmaterial whether the offense intended is committed or even attempted. Ifthe offense is intended, it is no defense that its commission was impossible.Separate offense.If the evidence warrants, the intended offense in the burglaryspecification may be separately charged. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 10 years.

Article 130-HousebreakingText of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who unlawfully entersthe building or structure of another with intent to commit a criminal offensetherein is guilty of housebreaking and shall be punished as a court-martialmay direct.**Elements.That the accused unlawfully entered a certain building or structureof a certain other person; and That the unlawful entry was made with the intent to commit a criminaloffense therein. Explanation.Scope of offense.The offense of housebreaking is broader than burglary in that theplace entered is not required to be a dwelling house; it is not necessarythat the place be occupied; it is not essential that there be a breaking;the entry may be either in the night or in the daytime; and the intent neednot be to commit one of the offenses made punishable under Articles 118 through128. Intent.The intent to commit some criminal offense is an essential elementof housebreaking and must be alleged and proved to support a conviction ofthis offense. If, after the entry the accused committed a criminal offenseinside the building or structure, it may be inferred that the accused intendedto commit that offense at the time of the entry. Criminal offense.Any act or omission which is punishable by courts-martial, exceptan act or omission constituting a purely military offense, is a "criminaloffense." Building, structure."Building" includes a room, shop, store, office, orapartment in a building. "Structure" refers only to those structureswhich are in the nature of a building or dwelling. Examples of these structuresare a stateroom, hold, or other compartment of a vessel, an inhabitable trailer, an inclosed truck or freight car, a tent, and a houseboat. It is not necessarythat the building or structure be in use at the time of the entry. Entry._See_ paragraph 55c(3). Separate offense.If the evidence warrants, the intended offense in the housebreakingspecification may be separately charged. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years. Sample specification.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who in a judicialproceeding or in a course of justice willfully and corruptly-** **upon a lawful oath or in any form allowed by law to be substitutedfor an oath, gives any false testimony material to the issue or matter ofinquiry; or** **in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement underpenalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United StatesCode, subscribes any false statement material to the issue or matter of inquiry;is guilty of perjury and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**Elements.Giving false testimony.That the accused took an oath or affirmation in a certain judicialproceeding or course of justice; That the oath or affirmation was administered to the accused ina matter in which an oath or affirmation was required or authorized by law;That the oath or affirmation was administered by a person having authority to do so; That upon the oath or affirmation that accused willfully gave certaintestimony; That the testimony was material; That the testimony was false; and That the accused did not then believe the testimony to be true.Subscribing false statement.That the accused subscribed a certain statement in a judicial proceedingor course of justice; That in the declaration, certification, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury, the accused declared, certified, verified, orstated the truth of that certain statement; That the accused willfully subscribed the statement; That the statement was material; That the statement was false; and That the accused did not then believe the statement to be true.Explanation.In general."Judicial proceeding" includes a trial by court-martialand "course of justice" includes a preliminary hearing conducted under Article 32. If the accused is charged with having committed perjury before a court-martial, it must be shown that the court-martial was duly constituted.Giving false testimony.Nature.The testimony must be false and must be willfully and corruptlygiven; that is, it must be proved that the accused gave the false testimonywillfully and did not believe it to be true. A witness may commit perjuryby testifying to the truth of a matter when in fact the witness knows nothingabout it at all or is not sure about it, whether the thing is true or falsein fact. A witness may also commit perjury in testifying falsely as to abelief, remembrance, or impression, or as to a judgment or opinion. It isno defense that the witness voluntarily appeared, that the witness was incompetentas a witness, or that the testimony was given in response to questions thatthe witness could have declined to answer. Material matter.The false testimony must be with respect to a material matter, butthat matter need not be the main issue in the case. Thus, perjury may becommitted by giving false testimony with respect to the credibility of a materialwitness or in an affidavit in support of a request for a continuance, as wellas by giving false testimony with respect to a fact from which a legitimateinference may be drawn as to the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue.Proof.The falsity of the allegedly perjured statement cannot be provedby circumstantial evidence alone, except with respect to matters which bytheir nature are not susceptible of direct proof. The falsity of the statementcannot be proved by the testimony of a single witness unless that testimonydirectly contradicts the statement and is corroborated by other evidenceeither direct or circumstantial, tending to prove the falsity of the statement.However, documentary evidence directly disproving the truth of the statementcharged to have been perjured need not be corroborated if: the document isan official record shown to have been well known to the accused at the timethe oath was taken; or the documentary evidence originated from the accused-orhad in any manner been recognized by the accused as containing the truth-before the allegedly perjured statement was made. Oath.The oath must be one recognized or authorized by law and must beduly administered by one authorized to administer it. When a form of oathhas been prescribed, a literal following of that form is not essential; itis sufficient if the oath administered conforms in substance to the prescribedform. "Oath" includes an affirmation when the latter is authorizedin lieu of an oath. Belief of accused.The fact that the accused did not believe the statement to be truemay be proved by testimony of one witness without corroboration or by circumstantialevidence. Subscribing false statement._See_ subparagraphs (1) and (2), above, as applicable.Section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, provides for subscribing tothe truth of a document by signing it expressly subject to the penalty forperjury. The signing must take place in a judicial proceeding or course ofjustice-for example, if a witness signs under penalty of perjury summarizedtestimony given at an Article 32 preliminary hearing. It is not required that thedocument be sworn before a third party. Section 1746 does not change the requirement that a deposition be given under oath or alter the situation where an oathis required to be taken before a specific person. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years.

Article 132-Frauds against the United StatesText of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter-** **who, knowing it to be false or fraudulent-****makes any claim against the United States or any officerthereof; or** **presents to any person in the civil or military service thereof,for approval or payment, any claim against the United States or any officer thereof;** **who, for the purpose of obtaining the approval, allowance,or payment of any claim against the United States or any officer thereof-****makes or uses any writing or other paper knowing it to containany false or fraudulent statements;** **makes any oath to any fact or to any writing or other paperknowing the oath to be false; or** **forges or counterfeits any signature upon any writing orother paper, or uses any such signature knowing it to be forged or counterfeited;****who, having charge, possession, custody, or control of anymoney, or other property of the United States, furnished or intended forthe armed forces thereof, knowingly delivers to any person having authorityto receive it, any amount thereof less than that for which he receives a certificateor receipt; or** **who, being authorized to make or deliver any paper certifyingthe receipt of any property of the United States furnished or intended forthe armed forces thereof, makes or delivers to any person such writing withouthaving full knowledge of the truth of the statements therein contained andwith intent to defraud the United States;

shall, upon conviction, be punishedas a court-martial may direct.** Elements.Making a false or fraudulent claim.That the accused made a certain claim against the United Statesor an officer thereof; That the claim was false or fraudulent in certain particulars; andThat the accused then knew that the claim was false or fraudulentin these particulars. Presenting for approval or payment a false or fraudulent claim.That the accused presented for approval or payment to a certainperson in the civil or military service of the United States having authorityto approve or pay it a certain claim against the United States or an officerthereof; That the claim was false or fraudulent in certain particulars; andThat the accused then knew that the claim was false or fraudulentin these particulars. Making or using a false writing or other paper in connection with claims.That the accused made or used a certain writing or other paper;That certain material statements in the writing or other paper werefalse or fraudulent; That the accused then knew the statements were false or fraudulent;and That the act of the accused was for the purpose of obtaining theapproval, allowance, or payment of a certain claim or claims against theUnited States or an officer thereof. False oath in connection with claims.That the accused made an oath to a certain fact or to a certainwriting or other paper; That the oath was false in certain particulars; That the accused then knew it was false; and That the act was for the purpose of obtaining the approval, allowance,or payment of a certain claim or claims against the United States or an officerthereof. Forgery of signature in connection with claims.That the accused forged or counterfeited the signature of a certainperson on a certain writing or other paper; and That the act was for the purpose of obtaining the approval, allowance,or payment of a certain claim against the United States or an officer thereof.Using forged signature in connection with claims.That the accused used the forged or counterfeited signature of acertain person; That the accused then knew that the signature was forged or counterfeited;and That the act was for the purpose of obtaining the approval, allowance,or payment of a certain claim against the United States or an officer thereof.Delivering less than amount called for by receipt.That the accused had charge, possession, custody, or control ofcertain money or property of the United States furnished or intended forthe armed forces thereof; That the accused obtained a certificate or receipt for a certainamount or quantity of that money or property; That for the certificate or receipt the accused knowingly deliveredto a certain person having authority to receive it an amount or quantityof money or property less than the amount or quantity thereof specified inthe certificate or receipt; and That the undelivered money or property was of a certain value.Making or delivering receipt without having full knowledge that itis true.That the accused was authorized to make or deliver a paper certifyingthe receipt from a certain person of certain property of the United Statesfurnished or intended for the armed forces thereof; That the accused made or delivered to that person a certificateor receipt; That the accused made or delivered the certificate without havingfull knowledge of the truth of a certain material statement or statementstherein; That the act was done with intent to defraud the United States;and That the property certified as being received was of a certain value.Explanation.Making a false or fraudulent claim.Claim.A "claim" is a demand for a transfer of ownership ofmoney or property and does not include requisitions for the mere use of property.This article applies only to claims against the United States or any officerthereof as such, and not to claims against an officer of the United Statesin that officer's private capacity. Making a claim.Making a claim is a distinct act from presenting it. A claim maybe made in one place and presented in another. The mere writing of a paperin the form of a claim, without any further act to cause the paper to becomea demand against the United States or an officer thereof, does not constitutemaking a claim. However, any act placing the claim in official channels constitutesmaking a claim, even if that act does not amount to presenting a claim. Itis not necessary that the claim be allowed or paid or that it be made bythe person to be benefited by the allowance or payment. _See_ alsosubparagraph (2), below. Knowledge.The claim must be made with knowledge of its fictitious or dishonestcharacter. This article does not proscribe claims, however groundless theymay be, that the maker believes to be valid, or claims that are merely madenegligently or without ordinary prudence. Presenting for approval or payment a false or fraudulent claim.False and fraudulent.False and fraudulent claims include not only those containing somematerial false statement, but also claims which the claimant knows to havebeen paid or for some other reason the claimant knows the claimant is notauthorized to present or upon which the claimant knows the claimant has noright to collect. Presenting a claim.The claim must be presented, directly or indirectly, to some personhaving authority to pay it. The person to whom the claim is presented maybe identified by position or authority to approve the claim, and need notbe identified by name in the specification. A false claim may be tacitly presented,as when a person who knows that there is no entitlement to certain pay acceptsit nevertheless without disclosing a disqualification, even though the personmay not have made any representation of entitlement to the pay. For example,a person cashing a pay check which includes an amount for a dependency allowance,knowing at the time that the entitlement no longer exists because of a changein that dependency status, has tacitly presented a false claim. _Seealso_ subparagraph (1), above. Making or using a false writing or other paper in connection with claims.The false or fraudulent statement must be material, that is, itmust have a tendency to mislead governmental officials in their considerationor investigation of the claim. The offense of making a writing or other paperknown to contain a false or fraudulent statement for the purpose of obtainingthe approval, allowance, or payment of a claim is complete when the writingor paper is made for that purpose, whether or not any use of the paper hasbeen attempted and whether or not the claim has been presented. _Seealso_ the explanation in subparagraph (1) and (2), above. False oath in connection with claims._See_ subparagraphs (1) and (2), above. Forgery of signature in connection with claims.Any fraudulent making of the signature of another is forging orcounterfeiting, whether or not an attempt is made to imitate the handwriting. _See_ paragraph 48(c) and subparagraph (1) and (2), above. Delivering less than amount called for by receipt.It is immaterial by what means-whether deceit, collusion,or otherwise-the accused effected the transaction, or what was theaccused's purpose. Making or delivering receipt without having full knowledge that itis true.When an officer or other person subject to military law is authorizedto make or deliver any paper certifying the receipt of any property of theUnited States furnished or intended for the armed forces thereof, and a receiptor other paper is presented for signature stating that a certain amount ofsupplies has been furnished by a certain contractor, it is that person'sduty before signing the paper to know that the full amount of supplies thereinstated to have been furnished has in fact been furnished, and that the statements contained in the paper are true. If the person signs the paper with intentto defraud the United States and without that knowledge, that person is guiltyof a violation of this section of the article. If the person signs the paperwith knowledge that the full amount was not received, it may be inferred thatthe person intended to defraud the United States. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Article 132(1) and (2). Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of allpay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years. Article 132(3) and (4).When amount is $500.00 or less.

 **Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman whois convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punishedas a court-martial may direct.** Elements.That the accused did or omitted to do certain acts; and That, under the circumstances, these acts or omissions constitutedconduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman. Explanation.Gentleman.As used in this article, "gentleman" includes both maleand female commissioned officers, cadets, and midshipmen. Nature of offense.Conduct violative of this article is action or behavior in an officialcapacity which, in dishonoring or disgracing the person as an officer, seriouslycompromises the officer's character as a gentleman, or action or behaviorin an unofficial or private capacity which, in dishonoring or disgracing theofficer personally, seriously compromises the person's standing as an officer.There are certain moral attributes common to the ideal officer and the perfectgentleman, a lack of which is indicated by acts of dishonesty, unfair dealing, indecency, indecorum, lawlessness, injustice, or cruelty. Not everyone isor can be expected to meet unrealistically high moral standards, but thereis a limit of tolerance based on customs of the service and military necessity below which the personal standards of an officer, cadet, or midshipman cannotfall without seriously compromising the person's standing as an officer,cadet, or midshipman or the person's character as a gentleman. This article prohibits conduct by a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman which,taking all the circumstances into consideration, is thus compromising. Thisarticle includes acts made punishable by any other article, provided theseacts amount to conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Thus, a commissionedofficer who steals property violates both this article and Article 121. Wheneverthe offense charged is the same as a specific offense set forth in this Manual,the elements of proof are the same as those set forth in the paragraph which treats that specific offense, with the additional requirement that the actor omission constitutes conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman. Examples of offenses.Instances of violation of this article include knowingly makinga false official statement; dishonorable failure to pay a debt; cheatingon an exam; opening and reading a letter of another without authority; usinginsulting or defamatory language to another officer in that officer's presenceor about that officer to other military persons; being drunk and disorderlyin a public place; public association with known prostitutes; committingor attempting to commit a crime involving moral turpitude; and failing withoutgood cause to support the officer's family. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinementfor a period not in excess of that authorized for the most analogous offensefor which a punishment is prescribed in this Manual, or, if none is prescribed,for 1 year.

 **Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter,all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and disciplinein the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subjectto this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general,special, or summary court-martial, according to the nature and degree ofthe offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court.**Elements.The proof required for conviction of an offense under Article 134 depends upon the nature of the misconduct charged. If the conduct is punished as a crime or offense not capital, the proof must establish every element of the crime or offense as required by the applicable law. All offenses under Article 134 require proof of a single terminal element; however, the terminal element may be proven using any of three theories of liability corresponding to clause 1, 2, or 3 offenses.Discussion The terminal element is merely the expression of one of the clauses under Article 134. See paragraph c below for an explanation of the clauses and rules for drafting specifications. More than one clause may be alleged and proven; however, proof of only one clause will satisfy the terminal element. For clause 3 offenses, the military judge may judicially notice whether an offense is capital. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 202.For clause 1 or 2 offenses under Article 134, the following proof is required:That the accused did or failed to do certain acts; andThat, under the circumstances, the accused's conduct was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.For clause 3 offenses under Article 134, the following proof is required: That the accused did or failed to do certain acts that satisfy each element of the federal statute (including, in the case of a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 13, each element of the assimilated State, Territory, Possession, or District law); and That the offense charged was an offense not capital.Explanation.In general.Article 134 makes punishable acts in three categories of offensesnot specifically covered in any other article of the code. These are referredto as "clauses 1, 2, and 3" of Article 134. Clause 1 offensesinvolve disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and disciplinein the armed forces. Clause 2 offenses involve conduct of a nature to bringdiscredit upon the armed forces. Clause 3 offenses involve noncapital crimesor offenses which violate Federal law including law made applicable throughthe Federal Assimilative Crimes Act, _see_ subsection (4)below. If any conduct of this nature is specifically made punishable byanother article of the code, it must be charged as a violation of that article. _See_ subparagraph (5)(a) below. However, _see_ paragraph59_c_ for offenses committed by commissioned officers, cadets,and midshipmen. Disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and disciplinein the armed forces (clause 1).To the prejudice of good order and discipline."To the prejudice of good order and discipline" refers only to acts directly prejudicial to good order and discipline and not toacts which are prejudicial only in a remote or indirect sense. Almost anyirregular or improper act on the part of a member of the military service could be regarded as prejudicial in some indirect or remote sense; however,this article does not include these distant effects. It is confined to casesin which the prejudice is reasonably direct and palpable. An act in violationof a local civil law or of a foreign law may be punished if it constitutesa disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline in thearmed forces. However, _see_ R.C.M. 203 concerning subject-matterjurisdiction. Breach of custom of the service.A breach of a custom of the service may result in a violation of clause 1 of Article 134. In its legal sense, "custom" meansmore than a method of procedure or a mode of conduct or behavior which ismerely of frequent or usual occurrence. Custom arises out of long established practices which by common usage have attained the force of law in the militaryor other community affected by them. No custom may be contrary to existinglaw or regulation. A custom which has not been adopted by existing statuteor regulation ceases to exist when its observance has been generally abandoned.Many customs of the service are now set forth in regulations of the variousarmed forces. Violations of these customs should be charged under Article92 as violations of the regulations in which they appear if the regulationis punitive. _ See_ paragraph 16c. Conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces (clause2)."Discredit" means to injure the reputation of. This clause of Article 134 makes punishable conduct which has a tendency to bringthe service into disrepute or which tends to lower it in public esteem.Acts in violation of a local civil law or a foreign law may be punished if they are of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. However, _see_ R.C.M. 203 concerning subject-matter jurisdiction. Crimes and offenses not capital (clause 3).In general.State and foreign laws are not included within the crimes and offensesnot capital referred to in this clause of Article 134 and violations thereofmay not be prosecuted as such except when State law becomes Federal lawof local application under section 13 of title 18 of the United States Code(Federal Assimilative Crimes Act- _see_ subparagraph(4)(c) below). For the purpose of court-martial jurisdiction, the laws whichmay be applied under clause 3 of Article 134 are divided into two groups:crimes and offenses of unlimited application (crimes which are punishableregardless where they may be committed), and crimes and offenses of localapplication (crimes which are punishable only if committed in areas of federaljurisdiction). Crimes and offenses of unlimited application.Certain noncapital crimes and offenses prohibited by the UnitedStates Code are made applicable under clause 3 of Article 134 to all personssubject to the code regardless where the wrongful act or omission occurred.Examples include: counterfeiting (18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 471), and various fraudsagainst the Government not covered by Article 132. Crimes and offenses of local application.In general.A person subject to the code may not be punished under clause 3of Article 134 for an offense that occurred in a place where the law in questiondid not apply. For example, a person may not be punished under clause 3 ofArticle 134 when the act occurred in a foreign country merely because thatact would have been an offense under the United States Code had the act occurredin the United States. Regardless where committed, such an act might be punishableunder clauses 1 or 2 of Article 134. There are two types of congressionalenactments of local application: specific federal statutes (defining particularcrimes), and a general federal statute, the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act(which adopts certain state criminal laws). Federal Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 13).The Federal Assimilative Crimes Act is an adoption by Congress ofstate criminal laws for areas of exclusive or concurrent federal jurisdiction,provided federal criminal law, including the UCMJ, has not defined an applicableoffense for the misconduct committed. The Act applies to state laws validlyexisting at the time of the offense without regard to when these laws wereenacted, whether before or after passage of the Act, and whether before orafter the acquisition of the land where the offense was committed. For example, if a person committed an act on a military installation in the United Statesat a certain location over which the United States had either exclusive orconcurrent jurisdiction, and it was not an offense specifically defined byfederal law (including the UCMJ), that person could be punished for that actby a court-martial if it was a violation of a noncapital offense under thelaw of the State where the military installation was located. This is possiblebecause the Act adopts the criminal law of the state wherein the militaryinstallation is located and applies it as though it were federal law. Thetext of the Act is as follows: Whoever within or upon any of the places nowexisting or hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section 7 of this title, is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishableby any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omittedwithin the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession, or District in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time ofsuch act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to alike punishment. Limitations on Article 134.Preemption doctrine.The preemption doctrine prohibits application of Article 134 toconduct covered by Articles 80 through 132. For example, larceny is coveredin Article 121, and if an element of that offense is lacking-for example,intent-there can be no larceny or larceny-type offense, either underArticle 121 or, because of preemption, under Article 134. Article 134 cannotbe used to create a new kind of larceny offense, one without the requiredintent, where Congress has already set the minimum requirements for such anoffense in Article 121. Capital offense.A capital offense may not be tried under Article 134. Drafting specifications for Article 134 offenses.Specifications under clause 1 or 2.When alleging a clause 1 or 2 violation, the specification must expressly allege that the conduct was "to the prejudice of good order and discipline" or that it was "of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces." The same conduct may be prejudicial to good order and discipline in the armed forces and at the same time be of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. Both clauses may be alleged; however, only one must be proven to satisfy the terminal element. If conduct by an accused does not fall under any of the enumerated Article 134 offenses (paragraphs 61 through 113 of this Part), a specification not listed in this Manual may be used to allege the offense.Discussion Clauses 1 and 2 are theories of liability that must be expressly alleged in a specification so that the accused will be given notice as to which clause or clauses to defend against. The words "to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces" encompass both paragraph c.(2)(a), prejudice to good order and discipline, and paragraph c.(2)(b), breach of custom of the Service. A generic sample specification is provided below:

 "_In that  , (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on board location), on or about _____ 20__, (commit elements of Article 134 clause 1 or 2 offense), and that said conduct (was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces) (and) (was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces)_."

 If clauses 1 and 2 are alleged together in the terminal element, the word "and" should be used to separate them. Any clause not proven beyond a reasonable doubt should be excepted from the specification at findings. See R.C.M. 918(a)(1). _See also_ Appendix 23 of this Manual, Art. 79. Although using the conjunctive "and" to connect the two theories of liability is recommended, a specification connecting the two theories with the disjunctive "or" is sufficient to provide the accused reasonable notice of the charge against him. _See_ Appendix 23 of this Manual, Art. 134.DiscussionThe first sentence in paragraph 60c(6)(a) above is inaccurate, as set forth in _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). _See also United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012). Amending subparagraph (6)(a) requires an Executive Order, hence the strikethrough font. To state an offense under Article 134, practitioners should expressly allege at least one of the three terminal elements, i.e., that the alleged conduct was: prejudicial to good order and discipline; service discrediting; or a crime or offense not capital. _See Fosler_, 70 M.J. at 226 and R.C.M 307(c)(3)._See also_ the analysis related to this paragraph in Appendix 23. For an explanation of clause 1, 2, and 3 offenses under Article 134, see paragraph 60c(1)-(4).

 A generic sample specification is provided below with the terminal element(s) for a clause 1 or 2 offense:

_"In that  , (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/onboard-location), on or about (date), (commit elements of Article 134, clause 1 or 2, offense), and that said conduct was (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces) (or) (and was) (of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces)."_

 Lesser included offenses are defined and explained under Article 79; however, in 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces examined Article 79 and clarified the legal test for lesser included offenses._See United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). Under _Jones_, an offense under Article 79 is "necessarily included" in the offense charged only if the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the greater offense alleged. 68 M.J. at 472. _See also_ discussion following paragraph 3b(1)(c) in this part and the related analysis in Appendix 23 of this Manual. This change in the law has particularly broad impact on Article 134 offenses, and practitioners should carefully consider lesser included offenses using the elements test in conformity with _Jones_. _See_ paragraph 3b(4) in Appendix 23 of this Manual. If it is uncertain whether an Article 134 offense is included within a charged offense, the government may plead in the alternative, or with accused consent, the government may amend the charge sheet. _Jones_, 68 M.J. at 472-3 (referring to R.C.M. 603(d) for amending a charge sheet).Specifications under clause 3.When alleging a clause 3 violation, the specification must expressly allege that the conduct was "an offense not capital," and each element of the federal statute (including, in the case of a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 13, each element of the assimilated State, Territory, Possession, or District law) must be alleged expressly or by necessary implication. In addition, the federal statute should be identified.DiscussionThe words "an offense not capital" are sufficient to provide notice to the accused that a clause 3 offense has been charged and are meant to include all crimes and offenses not capital. A generic sample specification for clause 3 offenses is provided below:

 _In that _______, (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on board location), on or about _____ 20__, (commit: address each element), an offense not capital, in violation of (name or citation of statute)_.

In addition to alleging each element of the federal statute, practitioners should consider including, when appropriate and necessary, words of criminality (_e.g._, wrongfully, knowingly, or willfully).Article 134-(Animal Abuse)Text of statute._See_ paragraph 60. Elements.Abuse, neglect, or abandonment of an animal.That the accused wrongfully abused, neglected, or abandoned a certain (public*) animal (and the accused caused the serious injury or death of the animal*); andThat, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

Elements.That the accused wrongfully had sexual intercourse with a certainperson; That, at the time, the accused or the other person was married tosomeone else; and That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was tothe prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was ofa nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. Explanation.Nature of offense.Adultery is clearly unacceptable conduct, and it reflects adverselyon the service record of the military member. Conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline or of a nature tobring discredit upon the armed forces.To constitute an offense under the UCMJ, the adulterous conductmust either be directly prejudicial to good order and discipline or servicediscrediting. Adulterous conduct that is directly prejudicial includes conduct that has an obvious, and measurably divisive effect on unit or organization discipline, morale, or cohesion, or is clearly detrimental to the authorityor stature of or respect toward a servicemember. Adultery may also be service discrediting, even though the conduct is only indirectly or remotely prejudicialto good order and discipline. Discredit means to injure the reputation ofthe armed forces and includes adulterous conduct that has a tendency, becauseof its open or notorious nature, to bring the service into disrepute, makeit subject to public ridicule, or lower it in public esteem. While adulterousconduct that is private and discreet in nature may not be service discreditingby this standard, under the circumstances, it may be determined to be conductprejudicial to good order and discipline. Commanders should consider allrelevant circumstances, including but not limited to the following factors,when determining whether adulterous acts are prejudicial to good order anddiscipline or are of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces:The accused's marital status, military rank, grade, or position;  The co-actor's marital status, military rank, grade, and position,or relationship to the armed forces; The military status of the accused's spouse or the spouse of co-actor,or their relationship to the armed forces; The impact, if any, of the adulterous relationship on the abilityof the accused, the co-actor, or the spouse of either to perform their dutiesin support of the armed forces; The misuse, if any, of government time and resources to facilitatethe commission of the conduct; Whether the conduct persisted despite counseling or orders to desist;the flagrancy of the conduct, such as whether any notoriety ensued; and whetherthe adulterous act was accompanied by other violations of the UCMJ; The negative impact of the conduct on the units or organizationsof the accused, the co-actor or the spouse of either of them, such as a detrimentaleffect on unit or organization morale, teamwork, and efficiency;  Whether the accused or co-actor was legally separated; and  Whether the adulterous misconduct involves an ongoing or recentrelationship or is remote in time. Marriage.A marriage exists until it is dissolved in accordance with the lawsof a competent state or foreign jurisdiction. Mistake of fact.A defense of mistake of fact exists if the accused had an honestand reasonable belief either that the accused and the co-actor were bothunmarried, or that they were lawfully married to each other. If this defense is raised by the evidence, then the burden of proof is upon the United Statesto establish that the accused's belief was unreasonable or not honest. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.

Deleted-See Appendix 27Indecent assault was deleted by Executive Order 13447, 72 Fed. Reg. 56179(Oct. 2, 2007). _See_ Appendix 25.Article 134-(Assault-with intent to commit murder, voluntarymanslaughter, rape, robbery, forcible sodomy, arson, burglary, or housebreaking)Text of statute._See_ paragraph 60. Elements.That the accused assaulted a certain person; That, at the time of the assault, the accused intended to kill (asrequired for murder or voluntary manslaughter) or intended to commit rape,robbery, forcible sodomy, arson, burglary, or housebreaking; and That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was tothe prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was ofa nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. Explanation.In general.An assault with intent to commit any of the offenses mentioned aboveis not necessarily the equivalent of an attempt to commit the intended offense,for an assault can be committed with intent to commit an offense withoutachieving that proximity to consummation of an intended offense which is essentialto an attempt. _See_ paragraph 4. Assault with intent to murder.Assault with intent to commit murder is assault with specific intentto kill. Actual infliction of injury is not necessary. To constitute an assaultwith intent to murder with a firearm, it is not necessary that the weaponbe discharged. When the intent to kill exists, the fact that for some unknownreason the actual consummation of the murder by the means employed is impossibleis not a defense if the means are apparently adapted to the end in view.The intent to kill need not be directed against the person assaulted if the assault is committed with intent to kill some person. For example, if a person,intending to kill Jones, shoots Smith, mistaking Smith for Jones, that personis guilty of assaulting Smith with intent to murder. If a person fires intoa group with intent to kill anyone in the group, that person is guilty ofand assault with intent to murder each member of the group. Assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter.Assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter is an assaultcommitted with a specific intent to kill under such circumstances that, ifdeath resulted therefrom, the offense of voluntary manslaughter would havebeen committed. There can be no assault with intent to commit involuntarymanslaughter, for it is not a crime capable of being intentionally committed.Assault with intent to commit rape.In assault with intent to commit rape, the accused must have intended to complete the offense. Any lesser intent will not suffice. No actual touching is necessary, but indecent advancesand importunities, however earnest, not accompanied by such an intent, donot constitute this offense, nor do mere preparations to rape not amountingto an assault. Once an assault with intent to commit rape is made, it isno defense that the accused voluntarily desisted. Assault with intent to rob.For assault with intent to rob, the fact that the accused intendedto take money and that the person the accused intended to rob had none isnot a defense. Assault with intent to commit forcible sodomy.Assault with intent to commit forcible sodomy is an assault against a humanbeing and must be committed with a specific intent to commit forcible sodomy. Anylesser intent, or different intent, will not suffice. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Assault with intent to commit murder or rape.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 20 years. Assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter, robbery, forcible sodomy,arson, or burglary.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, andconfinement for 10 years. Assault with intent to commit housebreaking.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years. Sample specification.

Article 134-(Bigamy)Text of statute._See_ paragraph 60. Elements.That the accused had a living lawful spouse; That while having such spouse the accused wrongfully married another person; and That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was tothe prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was ofa nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. Explanation.Bigamy is contracting another marriage by one who already has a living lawful spouse. If a prior marriage was void, it will have createdno status of "lawful spouse." However, if it was only voidableand has not been voided by a competent court, this is no defense. A beliefthat a prior marriage has been terminated by divorce, death of the otherspouse, or otherwise, constitutes a defense only if the belief was reasonable. _See_ R.C.M. 916(j)(1). Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years.

Article 134-(Bribery and graft)Text of statute. _See_ paragraph 60. Elements.Asking, accepting, or receiving.That the accused wrongfully asked, accepted, or received a thingof value from a certain person or organization; That the accused then occupied a certain official position or had certain official duties; That the accused asked, accepted, or received this thing of value (with the intent to have the accused's decision or action influenced withrespect to a certain matter)* (as compensation for or in recognition ofservices rendered, to be rendered, or both, by the accused in relation toa certain matter)**; That this certain matter was an official matter in which the United States was and is interested; and That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was tothe prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was ofa nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. (*Note: This element is required for bribery.) (**Note: This element is required for graft.)Promising, offering, or giving.That the accused wrongfully promised, offered, or gave a thing of value to a certain person; That this person then occupied a certain official position or had certain official duties; That this thing of value was promised, offered, or given (with the intent to influence the decision or action of this person)* (as compensation for or in recognition of services rendered, to be rendered, or both, bythis person in relation to a certain matter)**; That this matter was an official matter in which the United States was and is interested; and That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was tothe prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was ofa nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. (*Note: This element is required for bribery.) (**Note: This element is required for graft.)Explanation.Bribery requires an intent to influence or be influenced in anofficial matter; graft does not. Graft involves compensation for services performed in an official matter when no compensation is due. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

Article 134-(Check, worthless, making and uttering-bydishonorably failing to maintain funds)Text of statute._See_ paragraph 60. Elements.That the accused made and uttered a certain check; That the check was made and uttered for the purchase of a certainthing, in payment of a debt, or for a certain purpose; That the accused subsequently failed to place or maintain sufficientfunds in or credit with the drawee bank for payment of the check in fullupon its presentment for payment; That this failure was dishonorable; and That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was tothe prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was ofa nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. Explanation.This offense differs from an Article 123a offense (paragraph 49)in that there need be no intent to defraud or deceive at the time of making,drawing, uttering, or delivery, and that the accused need not know at thattime that the accused did not or would not have sufficient funds for payment.The gist of the offense lies in the conduct of the accused after utteringthe instrument. Mere negligence in maintaining one's bank balance is insufficientfor this offense, for the accused's conduct must reflect bad faith or grossindifference in this regard. As in the offense of dishonorable failure topay debts (_see_ paragraph 71), dishonorable conduct of theaccused is necessary, and the other principles discussed in paragraph 71 alsoapply here. Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. Maximum punishment.Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, andconfinement for 6 months. Sample specification. 

 In that  (personal jurisdiction data),did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required),on or about  20 , make andutter to  a certain check, in words and figures asfollows, to wit:  , (for the purchase of  ) (in payment of a debt) (for the purpose of  ),and did thereafter dishonorably fail to (place) (maintain) sufficient fundsin the  Bank for payment of such check in full uponits presentment for payment, and that said conduct was (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces) (of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces) (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces and was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces). Article 134-(Child endangerment)Text of statute.See paragraph 60.Elements.That the accused had a duty for the care of a certain child;That the child was under the age of 16 years;That the accused endangered the child's mental or physical health, safety, or welfare through design or culpable negligence; andThat, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.Explanation.In general.This offense is intended to prohibit and therefore deter child endangerment through design or culpable negligence.Design.Design means on purpose, intentionally, or according to plan and requires specific intent to endanger the child.Culpable negligence.Culpable negligence is a degree of carelessness greater than simple negligence. It is a negligent act or omission accompanied by a culpable disregard for the foreseeable consequences to others of that act or omission. In the context of this offense, culpable negligence may include acts that, when viewed in the light of human experience, might foreseeably result in harm to a child, even though such harm would not necessarily be the natural and probable consequences of such acts. In this regard, the age and maturity of the child, the conditions surrounding the neglectful conduct, the proximity of assistance available, the nature of the environment in which the child may have been left, the provisions made for care of the child, and the location of the parent or adult responsible for the child relative to the location of the child, among others, may be considered in determining whether the conduct constituted culpable negligence.Harm. Actual physical or mental harm to the child is not required. The offense requires that the accused's actions reasonably could have caused physical or mental harm or suffering. However, if the accused's conduct does cause actual physical or mental harm, the potential maximum punishment increases.See Paragraph 54c(4)(a)(iii) for an explanation of "grievous bodily harm".Endanger."Endanger" means to subject one to a reasonable probability of harm.Age of victim as a factor.While this offense may be committed against any child under 16, the age of the victim is a factor in the culpable negligence determination. Leaving a teenager alone for an evening may not be culpable (or even simple) negligence; leaving an infant or toddler for the same period might constitute culpable negligence. On the other hand, leaving a teenager without supervision for an extended period while the accused was on temporary duty outside commuting distance might constitute culpable negligence.Duty required.The duty of care is determined by the totality of the circumstances and may be established by statute, regulation, legal parent-child relationship, mutual agreement, or assumption of control or custody by affirmative act. When there is no duty of care of a child, there is no offense under this paragraph. Thus, there is no offense when a stranger makes no effort to feed a starving child or an individual/neighbor not charged with the care of a child does not prevent the child from running and playing in the street.Lesser included offenses.See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

"Child Pornography" means material that contains either an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct or a visual depiction of an actual minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.An accused may not be convicted of possessing, receiving, viewing, distributing, or producing child pornography if he was not aware that the images were of minors, or what appeared to be minors, engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Awareness may be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the name of a computer file or folder, the name of the host website from which a visual depiction was viewed or received, search terms used, and the number of images possessed. "Distributing" means delivering to the actual or constructive possession of another. "Minor" means any person under the age of 18 years."Possessing" means exercising control of something. Possession may be direct physical custody like holding an item in one's hand, or it may be constructive, as in the case of a person who hides something in a locker or a car to which that person may return to retrieve it. Possession must be knowing and conscious. Possession inherently includes the power or authority to preclude control by others. It is possible for more than one person to possess an item simultaneously, as when several people share control over an item. "Producing" means creating or manufacturing. As used in this paragraph, it refers to making child pornography that did not previously exist. It does not include reproducing or copying."Sexually explicit conduct" means actual or simulated:sexual intercourse or sodomy, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; bestiality; masturbation;sadistic or masochistic abuse; orlascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person."Visual depiction" includes any developed or undeveloped photograph, picture, film or video; any digital or computer image, picture, film, or video made by any means, including those transmitted by any means including streaming media, even if not stored in a permanent format; or any digital or electronic data capable of conversion into a visual image. "Wrongfulness." Any facts or circumstances that show that a visual depiction of child pornography was unintentionally or inadvertently acquired are relevant to wrongfulness, including, but not limited to, the method by which the visual depiction was acquired, the length of time the visual depiction was maintained, and whether the visual depiction was promptly, and in good faith, destroyed or reported to law enforcement.On motion of the government, in any prosecution under this paragraph, except for good cause shown, the name, address, social security number, or other nonphysical identifying information, other than the age or approximate age, of any minor who is depicted in any child pornography or visual depiction or copy thereof shall not be admissible and may be redacted from any otherwise admissible evidence, and the panel shall be instructed, upon request of the Government, that it can draw no inference from the absence of such evidence.

Explanation.Inveigle, decoy."Inveigle" means to lure, lead astray, or entice byfalse representations or other deceitful means. For example, a person whoentices another to ride in a car with a false promise to take the personto a certain destination has inveigled the passenger into the car. "Decoy"means to entice or lure by means of some fraud, trick, or temptation. Forexample, one who lures a child into a trap with candy has decoyed the child.Held."Held" means detained. The holding must be more thana momentary or incidental detention. For example, a robber who holds thevictim at gunpoint while the victim hands over a wallet, or a rapist whothrows his victim to the ground, does not, by such acts, commit kidnapping.On the other hand, if, before or after such robbery or rape, the victim isinvoluntarily transported some substantial distance, as from a housing areato a remote area of the base or post, this may be kidnapping, in additionto robbery or rape. Against the will."Against that person's will" means that the victim washeld involuntarily. The involuntary nature of the detention may result fromforce, mental or physical coercion, or from other means, including falserepresentations. If the victim is incapable of having a recognizable will,as in the case of a very young child or a mentally incompetent person, theholding must be against the will of the victim's parents or legal guardian.Evidence of the availability or nonavailability to the victim of means ofexit or escape is relevant to the voluntariness of the detention, as is evidenceof threats or force, or lack thereof, by the accused to detain the victim.Willfully.The accused must have specifically intended to hold the victimagainst the victim's will to be guilty of kidnapping. An accidental detentionwill not suffice. The holding need not have been for financial or personalgain or for any other particular purpose. It may be an aggravating circumstancethat the kidnapping was for ransom, however. _See_ R.C.M.1001(b)(4). Wrongfully."Wrongfully" means without justification or excuse.For example, a law enforcement official may justifiably apprehend and detain,by force if necessary (_see_ R.C.M. 302(d)(3)), a personreasonably believed to have committed an offense. An official who unlawfully uses the official's authority to apprehend someone is not guilty of kidnapping,but may be guilty of unlawful detention. _See_ paragraph21. It is not wrongful under this paragraph and therefore not kidnappingfor a parent or legal guardian to seize and hold that parent's or legal guardian'sminor child.
