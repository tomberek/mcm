#  Discussion

--LSQP--Note: To state an offense under Article 134, practitioners should expressly allege at least one of the three terminal elements, i.e., that the alleged conduct was: prejudicial to good order and discipline; service discrediting; or a crime or offense not capital. _See United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011); _United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012). _See also_ paragraph 60c(6)(a) in this part and R.C.M. 307(c)(3).--RSQP--

  --LSQP--Note: In 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces examined Article 79 and clarified the legal test for lesser included offenses. _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). An offense under Article 79 is "necessarily included" in the offense charged only if the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the greater offense alleged. _See_ discussion following paragraph 3b(1)(c) in this part and the related analysis in Appendix 23 of this Manual.--RSQP--

  Part IV of the Manual addresses the punitive articles, 10 U.S.C. --SECT----SECT-- 877-934. Part IV is organized by paragraph beginning with Article 77; therefore, each paragraph number is associated with an article. For example, paragraph 45 addresses Article 120, Rape and sexual assault generally. Article 77, Principals, and Article 79, Lesser included offenses, are located in the punitive article subchapter of Title 10 but are not chargeable offenses as such.

  Other than Articles 77 and 79, the punitive articles of the code are discussed using the following sequence:

Text of the article 

Elements of the offense or offenses 

Explanation 

Lesser included offenses 

Maximum punishment 

Sample specifications 

  Lesser included offenses are established in subparagraph d of each paragraph of Part IV and are defined and explained under Article 79. Practitioners are advised, however, to read and comply with _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010).  _See_ note above.

  Sample specifications are provided in subparagraph f of each paragraph in Part IV and are meant to serve as a guide. The specifications may be varied in form and content as necessary.  R.C.M. 307 prescribes rules for preferral of charges and for drafting specifications. The discussion under that rule explains how to allege violations under the code using the format of charge and specification; however, practitioners are advised to read and comply with _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011) and _United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010).  _See_ two notes above and R.C.M. 307(c)(3).

  The term "elements," as used in Part IV, includes both the statutory elements of the offense and any aggravating factors listed under the President's authority which increases the maximum permissible punishment when specified aggravating factors are pleaded and proven.

  The prescriptions of maximum punishments in subparagraph e of each paragraph of Part IV must be read in conjunction with R.C.M. 1003, which prescribes additional punishments that may be available and additional limitations on punishments.

#  Article 77-Principals

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person punishable under this chapter who-**

(1) **commits an offense punishable by this chapter, or aids, abets,

counsels, commands, or procures its commission; or**

(2) **causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him would

be punishable by this chapter; is a principal.**

## b. Explanation.

### (1) Purpose.

Article 77 does not define an offense. Its purpose is to make clear

 that a person need not personally perform the acts necessary to constitute

an offense to be guilty of it. A person who aids, abets, counsels, commands,

or procures the commission of an offense, or who causes an act to be done

which, if done by that person directly, would be an offense is equally guilty

of the offense as one who commits it directly, and may be punished to the

same extent. 

  Article 77 eliminates the common law distinctions

between principal in the first degree ("perpetrator"); principal

in the second degree (one who aids, counsels, commands, or encourages the

commission of an offense and who is present at the scene of the crime-commonly

known as an "aider and abettor"); and accessory before the fact

(one who aids, counsels, commands, or encourages the commission of an offense

and who is not present at the scene of the crime). All of these are now "principals."

### (2) Who may be liable for an offense.

#### (a) Perpetrator.

A perpetrator is one who actually commits the offense, either by

the perpetrator's own hand, or by causing an offense to be committed by

knowingly or intentionally inducing or setting in motion acts by an animate

or inanimate agency or instrumentality which result in the commission of

an offense. For example, a person who knowingly conceals contraband drugs

in an automobile, and then induces another person, who is unaware and has

no reason to know of the presence of drugs, to drive the automobile onto

a military installation, is, although not present in the automobile, guilty

of wrongful introduction of drugs onto a military installation. (On these

facts, the driver would be guilty of no crime.) Similarly, if, upon orders

of a superior, a soldier shot a person who appeared to the soldier to be

an enemy, but was known to the superior as a friend, the superior would

be guilty of murder (but the soldier would be guilty of no offense). 

#### (b) Other Parties.

 If one is not a perpetrator, to be guilty of an offense committed

by the perpetrator, the person must: 

(i) Assist, encourage, advise, instigate, counsel, command, or procure

 another to commit, or assist, encourage, advise, counsel, or command another

in the commission of the offense; and 

(ii) Share in the criminal purpose or design. 

  One who,

without knowledge of the criminal venture or plan, unwittingly encourages

or renders assistance to another in the commission of an offense is not guilty

of a crime. _See_ the parentheticals in the examples in paragraph

1b(2)(a) above. In some circumstances, inaction may make one liable as a

party, where there is a duty to act. If a person (for example, a security

guard) has a duty to interfere in the commission of an offense, but does

not interfere, that person is a party to the crime _if_ such

a noninterference is intended to and does operate as an aid or encouragement

to the actual perpetrator. 

### (3) Presence.

#### (a) Not necessary.

Presence at the scene of the crime is not necessary to make one

a party to the crime and liable as a principal. For example, one who, knowing

that a person intends to shoot another person and intending that such an assault

be carried out, provides the person with a pistol, is guilty of assault when

the offense is committed, even though not present at the scene. 

#### (b) Not sufficient.

Mere presence at the scene of a crime does not make one a principal

 unless the requirements of paragraph 1b(2)(a) or (b) have been met. 

### (4) Parties whose intent differs from the perpetrator's.

When an offense charged requires proof of a specific intent or

particular state of mind as an element, the evidence must prove that the

accused had that intent or state of mind, whether the accused is charged

as a perpetrator or an "other party" to crime. It is possible

for a party to have a state of mind more or less culpable than the perpetrator

of the offense. In such a case, the party may be guilty of a more or less

serious offense than that committed by the perpetrator. For example, when

a homicide is committed, the perpetrator may act in the heat of sudden passion

caused by adequate provocation and be guilty of manslaughter, while the

party who, without such passion, hands the perpetrator a weapon and encourages

 the perpetrator to kill the victim, would be guilty of murder. On the other

 hand, if a party assists a perpetrator in an assault on a person who, known

only to the perpetrator, is an officer, the party would be guilty only of

assault, while the perpetrator would be guilty of assault on an officer.

### (5) Responsibility for other crimes.

A principal may be convicted of crimes committed by another principal

 if such crimes are likely to result as a natural and probable consequence

of the criminal venture or design. For example, the accused who is a party

to a burglary is guilty as a principal not only of the offense of burglary,

but also, if the perpetrator kills an occupant in the course of the burglary,

of murder. (_See also_ paragraph 5 concerning liability for

offenses committed by co-conspirators.) 

### (6) Principals independently liable.

One may be a principal, even if the perpetrator is not identified

or prosecuted, or is acquitted. 

### (7) Withdrawal.

A person may withdraw from a common venture or design and avoid

 liability for any offenses committed after the withdrawal. To be effective,

the withdrawal must meet the following requirements: 

(a) It must occur before the offense is committed; 

(b) The assistance, encouragement, advice, instigation, counsel, command,

 or procurement given by the person must be effectively countermanded or

negated; and 

(c) The withdrawal must be clearly communicated to the would-be perpetrators

or to appropriate law enforcement authorities in time for the perpetrators

to abandon the plan or for law enforcement authorities to prevent the offense.

#  Article 78-Accessory after the fact

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, knowing that an

offense punishable by this chapter has been committed, receives, comforts,

or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial,

 or punishment shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That an offense punishable by the code was committed by a certain

 person; 

(2) That the accused knew that this person had committed such offense;

(3) That thereafter the accused received, comforted, or assisted the

 offender; and 

(4) That the accused did so for the purpose of hindering or preventing

 the apprehension, trial, or punishment of the offender. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

The assistance given a principal by an accessory after the fact

is not limited to assistance designed to effect the escape or concealment

of the principal, but also includes acts performed to conceal the commission

 of the offense by the principal (for example, by concealing evidence of the

 offense). 

### (2) Failure to report offense.

The mere failure to report a known offense will not make one an

 accessory after the fact. Such failure may violate a general order or regulation,

however, and thus constitute an offense under Article 92. _See_ paragraph

16. If the offense involved is a serious offense, failure to report it may

 constitute the offense of misprision of a serious offense, under Article

134. _See_ paragraph 95. 

### (3) Offense punishable by the code.

The term "offense punishable by this chapter" in the

text of the article means any offense described in the code. 

### (4) Status of principal.

The principal who committed the offense in question need not be

 subject to the code, but the offense committed must be punishable by the

code. 

### (5) Conviction or acquittal of principal.

The prosecution must prove that a principal committed the offense

to which the accused is allegedly an accessory after the fact. However,

evidence of the conviction or acquittal of the principal in a separate trial

is not admissible to show that the principal did or did not commit the offense.

Furthermore, an accused may be convicted as an accessory after the fact despite

the acquittal in a separate trial of the principal whom the accused allegedly

comforted, received, or assisted. 

### (6) Accessory after the fact not a lesser included offense.

The offense of being an accessory after the fact is not a lesser

 included offense of the primary offense. 

### (7) Actual knowledge.

Actual knowledge is required but may be proved by circumstantial

 evidence. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Any person subject to the code who is found guilty as an accessory

 after the fact to an offense punishable by the code shall be subject to

the maximum punishment authorized for the principal offense, except that

in no case shall the death penalty nor more than one-half of the maximum

confinement authorized for that offense be adjudged, nor shall the period

of confinement exceed 10 years in any case, including offenses for which

life imprisonment may be adjudged. 

## f. Sample specification.

 

In that   (personal jurisdiction data),

knowing that (at/on board-location), on or about  20  , had committed an offense punishable

by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to wit:  ,

on or about   20 , in order

to (hinder) (prevent) the (apprehension) (trial) (punishment) of the said  , (receive) (comfort) (assist) the said  by  . 

#  Article 79-Conviction of lesser included offenses

## a. Text of statute.

 **An accused may be found guilty of an offense necessarily

 included in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit either the offense

charged or an offense necessarily included therein.** 

## b. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

A lesser offense is "necessarily included" in a charged offense when the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the charged offense, thereby putting the accused on notice to defend against the lesser offense in addition to the offense specifically charged. A lesser offense may be "necessarily included" when:

(a) All of the elements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, and the common elements are identical (for example, larceny as a lesser included offense of robbery);

(b) All of the elements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, but at least one element is a subset by being legally less serious (for example, housebreaking as a lesser included offense of burglary); or

(c) All of the elements of the lesser offense are "included and necessary" parts of the greater offense, but the mental element is a subset by being legally less serious (for example, wrongful appropriation as a lesser included offense of larceny).

####  Discussion

The "elements test" is the proper method for determining lesser included offenses. _See United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010); _Schmuck v. United States_, 489 U.S. 705 (1989); Appendix 23 of this Manual, Art. 79. Paragraph 3.b.(1) was amended to comport with the elements test, which requires that the elements of the lesser offense must be a subset of the elements of the charged offense. The elements test does not require identical statutory language, and use of normal principles of statutory interpretation is permitted. The elements test is necessary to safeguard the due process requirement of notice to a criminal defendant.

### (2) Sua sponte duty.

A military judge must instruct panel members on lesser included offenses reasonably raised by the evidence. 

### (3) Multiple lesser included offenses.

When the offense charged is a compound offense comprising two or more lesser included offenses, an accused may be found guilty of any or all of the offenses included in the offense charged. For example, robbery includes both larceny and assault. Therefore, in a proper case, a court-martial may find an accused not guilty of robbery, but guilty of wrongful appropriation and assault.

### (4) Findings of guilty to a lesser included offense.

A court-martial may find an accused not guilty of the offense charged, but guilty of a lesser included offense by the process of exception and substitution. The court-martial may except (that is, delete) the words in the specification that pertain to the offense charged and, if necessary, substitute language appropriate to the lesser included offense. For example, the accused is charged with murder in violation of Article 118, but found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in violation of Article 119. Such a finding may be worded as follows:

  Of the Specification: Guilty, except the word "murder" substituting therefor the words "willfully and unlawfully kill," of the excepted word, not guilty, of the substituted words, guilty.

  Of the Charge: Not guilty, but guilty of a violation of Article 119.

  If a court-martial finds an accused guilty of a lesser included offense, the finding as to the charge shall state a violation of the specific punitive article violated and not a violation of Article 79.

### (5) Specific lesser included offenses.

Specific lesser included offenses, if any, are listed for each offense in Appendix 12A, but the list is merely guidance to practitioners, is not all-inclusive, and is not binding on military courts.

###  Discussion

 Practitioners must consider lesser included offenses on a case-by-case basis. _See United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010); United States v. Alston, 69 M.J. 214 (C.A.A.F. 2010); discussion following paragraph 3.b.(1)(c) above. The lesser included offenses listed in Appendix 12A were amended in 2015 to comport with the elements test; however, practitioners must analyze each lesser included offense on a case-by-case basis. _See_ Appendix 23 of this Manual, Art. 79.

#  Article 80-Attempts

## a. Text of statute.

(a) **An act, done with specific intent to commit an offense under this

 chapter, amounting to more than mere preparation and tending, even though

 failing, to effect its commission, is an attempt to commit that offense.**

(b) **Any person subject to this chapter who attempts to commit any offense

 punishable by this chapter shall be punished as a court-martial may direct,

 unless otherwise specifically prescribed.**

(c) **Any person subject to this chapter may be convicted of an attempt

to commit an offense although it appears on the trial that the offense was

 consummated.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused did a certain overt act;

(2) That the act was done with the specific intent to commit a certain

 offense under the code; 

(3) That the act amounted to more than mere preparation; and 

(4) That the act apparently tended to effect the commission of the

intended offense. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

To constitute an attempt there must be a specific intent to commit

 the offense accompanied by an overt act which directly tends to accomplish

the unlawful purpose. 

### (2) More than preparation.

Preparation consists of devising or arranging the means or measures

 necessary for the commission of the offense. The overt act required goes

beyond preparatory steps and is a direct movement toward the commission

of the offense. For example, a purchase of matches with the intent to burn

a haystack is not an attempt to commit arson, but it is an attempt to commit

arson to applying a burning match to a haystack, even if no fire results.

The overt act need not be the last act essential to the consummation of the

offense. For example, an accused could commit an overt act, and then voluntarily

decide not to go through with the intended offense. An attempt would nevertheless

have been committed, for the combination of a specific intent to commit

an offense, plus the commission of an overt act directly tending to accomplish

it, constitutes the offense of attempt. Failure to complete the offense,

whatever the cause, is not a defense. 

### (3) Factual impossibility.

A person who purposely engages in conduct which would constitute

the offense if the attendant circumstances were as that person believed

them to be is guilty of an attempt. For example, if A, without justification

or excuse and with intent to kill B, points a gun at B and pulls the trigger,

A is guilty of attempt to murder, even though, unknown to A, the gun is defective

and will not fire. Similarly, a person who reaches into the pocket of another

with the intent to steal that person's billfold is guilty of an attempt

to commit larceny, even though the pocket is empty. 

### (4) Voluntary abandonment.

It is a defense to an attempt offense that the person voluntarily

and completely abandoned the intended crime, solely because of the person's

own sense that it was wrong, prior to the completion of the crime. The

voluntary abandonment defense is not allowed if the abandonment results,

in whole or in part, from other reasons, for example, the person feared detection

or apprehension, decided to await a better opportunity for success, was

unable to complete the crime, or encountered unanticipated difficulties or

 unexpected resistance. A person who is entitled to the defense of voluntary

 abandonment may nonetheless be guilty of a lesser included, completed offense.

 For example, a person who voluntarily abandoned an attempted armed robbery

may nonetheless be guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon. 

### (5) Solicitation.

 Soliciting another to commit an offense does not constitute an

 attempt. _See_ paragraph 6 for a discussion of Article 82,

solicitation. 

### (6) Attempts not under Article 80. 

While most attempts should be charged under Article 80, the following

 attempts are specifically addressed by some other article, and should be

charged accordingly: 

(a) Article 85-desertion 

(b) Article 94-mutiny or sedition. 

(c) Article 100-subordinate compelling 

(d) Article 104-aiding the enemy 

(e) Article 106a-espionage 

(f) Article 119a-attempting to kill an unborn child

(g) Article 128-assault 

### (7) Regulations.

An attempt to commit conduct which would violate a lawful general

 order or regulation under Article 92 (_see_ paragraph 16)

should be charged under Article 80. It is not necessary in such cases to

prove that the accused intended to violate the order or regulation, but it

must be proved that the accused intended to commit the prohibited conduct.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Any person subject to the code who is found guilty of an attempt

 under Article 80 to commit any offense punishable by the code shall be subject

to the same maximum punishment authorized for the commission of the offense

attempted, except that in no case shall the death penalty be adjudged, nor

shall any mandatory minimum punishment provisions apply; and in no case,

other than attempted murder, shall confinement exceeding 20 years be adjudged.

## f. Sample specification.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction data) did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data,

if required), on or about   20 ,

or by necessary implication every element). 

#  Article 81-Conspiracy

## a. Text of statute.

 (a) Any person subject to this chapter who conspires with any other person to commit an offense under this chapter shall, if one or more of the conspirators does an act to effect the object of the conspiracy, be punished as a court-martial may direct.

 (b) Any person subject to this chapter who conspires with any other person to commit an offense under the law of war, and who knowingly does an overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy, shall be punished, if death results to one or more of the victims, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial or military commission may direct, and, if death does not result to any of the victims, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial or military commission may direct.

### b. Elements.

#### (1) Conspiracy.

(a) That the accused entered into an agreement with one or more persons to commit an offense under the UCMJ; and 

(b) That, while the agreement continued to exist, and while the accused remained a party to the agreement, the accused or at least one of the co-conspirators performed an overt act for the purpose of bringing about the object of the conspiracy.

####  Conspiracy when offense is an offense under the law of war resulting in the death of one or more victims.

(a) That the accused entered into an agreement with one or more persons to commit an offense under the law of war;

(b) That, while the agreement continued to exist, and while the accused remained a party to the agreement, the accused knowingly performed an overt act for the purpose of bringing about the object of the conspiracy; and

(c) That death resulted to one or more victims.

### c. Explanation.

#### (1) Co-conspirators.

Two or more persons are required in order to have a conspiracy.

 Knowledge of the identity of co-conspirators and their particular connection

with the criminal purpose need not be established. The accused must be subject

to the code, but the other co-conspirators need not be. A person may be guilty

of conspiracy although incapable of committing the intended offense. For

example, a bedridden conspirator may knowingly furnish the car to be used

in a robbery. The joining of another conspirator after the conspiracy has

been established does not create a new conspiracy or affect the status of

the other conspirators. However, the conspirator who joined an existing

conspiracy can be convicted of this offense only if, at or after the time

of joining the conspiracy, an overt act in furtherance of the object of the

agreement is committed. 

#### (2) Agreement.

The agreement in a conspiracy need not be in any particular form

or manifested in any formal words. It is sufficient if the minds of the

parties arrive at a common understanding to accomplish the object of the

conspiracy, and this may be shown by the conduct of the parties. The agreement

need not state the means by which the conspiracy is to be accomplished or

what part each conspirator is to play. 

#### (3) Object of the agreement.

The object of the agreement must, at least in part, involve the

 commission of one or more offenses under the code. An agreement to commit

several offenses is ordinarily but a single conspiracy. Some offenses require

two or more culpable actors acting in concert. There can be no conspiracy

where the agreement exists only between the persons necessary to commit such

an offense. Examples include dueling, bigamy, incest, adultery, and bribery.

#### (4) Overt act.

(a) The overt act must be independent of the agreement to commit the

 offense; must take place at the time of or after the agreement; must be

done by one or more of the conspirators, but not necessarily the accused;

 and must be done to effectuate the object of the agreement. 

(b) The overt act need not be in itself criminal, but it must be a

manifestation that the agreement is being executed. Although committing the

intended offense may constitute the overt act, it is not essential that

the object offense be committed. Any overt act is enough, no matter how preliminary

or preparatory in nature, as long as it is a manifestation that the agreement

is being executed. 

(c) An overt act by one conspirator becomes the act of all without any

 new agreement specifically directed to that act and each conspirator is

equally guilty even though each does not participate in, or have knowledge

 of, all of the details of the execution of the conspiracy. 

#### (5) Liability for offenses.

Each conspirator is liable for all offenses committed pursuant to

the conspiracy by any of the co-conspirators while the conspiracy continues

and the person remains a party to it. 

#### (6) Withdrawal.

A party to the conspiracy who abandons or withdraws from the agreement

to commit the offense before the commission of an overt act by any conspirator

is not guilty of conspiracy. An effective withdrawal or abandonment must

consist of affirmative conduct which is wholly inconsistent with adherence

to the unlawful agreement and which shows that the party has severed all

connection with the conspiracy. A conspirator who effectively abandons or

withdraws from the conspiracy after the performance of an overt act by one

of the conspirators remains guilty of conspiracy and of any offenses committed

 pursuant to the conspiracy up to the time of the abandonment or withdrawal.

However, a person who has abandoned or withdrawn from the conspiracy is

not liable for offenses committed thereafter by the remaining conspirators.

 The withdrawal of a conspirator from the conspiracy does not affect the

status of the remaining members. 

#### (7) Factual impossibility.

It is not a defense that the means adopted by the conspirators to

 achieve their object, if apparently adapted to that end, were actually not

capable of success, or that the conspirators were not physically able to

 accomplish their intended object. 

#### (8) Conspiracy as a separate offense.

A conspiracy to commit an offense is a separate and distinct offense

 from the offense which is the object of the conspiracy, and both the conspiracy

and the consummated offense which was its object may be charged, tried,

and punished. The commission of the intended offense may also constitute

the overt act which is an element of the conspiracy to commit that offense.

#### (9) Special conspiracies under Article 134.

The United States Code prohibits conspiracies to commit certain

 specific offenses which do not require an overt act. These conspiracies

should be charged under Article 134. Examples include conspiracies to impede

or injure any Federal officer in the discharge of duties under 18 U.S.C.

--SECT-- 372, conspiracies against civil rights under 18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 241,

and certain drug conspiracies under 21 U.S.C. --SECT-- 846. _See_ paragraph

 60c(4)(c)(ii). 

### d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

### e. Maximum punishment.

Any person subject to the code who is found guilty of conspiracy shall be subject to the maximum punishment authorized for the offense which is the object of the conspiracy. However, with the exception noted below, if death is an authorized punishment for the offense which is the object of the conspiracy, the maximum punishment shall be dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for life without eligibility for parole. If the offense which is the object of the conspiracy is an offense under the law of war, the person knowingly performed an overt act for the purpose of bringing about the object of the conspiracy, and death results to one or more victims, the death penalty shall be an available punishment.

The offense is complete when a solicitation is made or advice is

 given with the specific wrongful intent to influence another or others to

 commit any of the four offenses named in Article 82. It is not necessary

that the person or persons solicited or advised agree to or act upon the

solicitation or advice. 

### (2) Form of solicitation.

Solicitation may be by means other than word of mouth or writing.

Any act or conduct which reasonably may be construed as a serious request

or advice to commit one of the four offenses named in Article 82 may constitute

solicitation. It is not necessary that the accused act alone in the solicitation

or in the advising; the accused may act through other persons in committing

this offense. 

### (3) Solicitations in violation of Article 134.

Solicitation to commit offenses other than violations of the four

 offenses named in Article 82 may be charged as violations of Article 134. _

See_ paragraph 105. However, some offenses require, as an element

of proof, some act of solicitation by the accused. These offenses are separate

and distinct from solicitations under Articles 82 and 134. When the accused's

act of solicitation constitutes, by itself, a separate offense, the accused

should be charged with that separate, distinct offense-for example,

pandering (_see_ paragraph 97) and obstruction of justice

(_see_ paragraph 96) in violation of Article 134. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

If the offense solicited or advised is committed or (in the case

of soliciting desertion or mutiny) attempted, then the accused shall be

punished with the punishment provided for the commission of the offense

solicited or advised. If the offense solicited or advised is not committed

or (in the case of soliciting desertion or mutiny) attempted, then the following

punishment may be imposed: 

(1) To desert-Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and

 allowances, and confinement for 3 years. 

(2) To mutiny-Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and

 allowances, and confinement for 10 years. 

(3) To commit an act of misbehavior before the enemy-Dishonorable

 discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 10

years. 

(4) To commit an act of sedition-Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture

 of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 10 years.

#  Article 83-Fraudulent enlistment, appointment, or separation

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person who-**

(1) **procures his own enlistment or appointment in the armed forces by

 knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his qualifications

for that enlistment or appointment and receives pay or allowances thereunder;

or**

(2) **procures his own separation from the armed forces by knowingly false

 representation or deliberate concealment as to his eligibility for that

separation; 

shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Fraudulent enlistment or appointment.

(a) That the accused was enlisted or appointed in an armed force; 

(b) That the accused knowingly misrepresented or deliberately concealed

a certain material fact or facts regarding qualifications of the accused

for enlistment or appointment; 

(c) That the accused's enlistment or appointment was obtained or procured

 by that knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment; and 

(d) That under this enlistment or appointment that accused received

pay or allowances or both. 

### (2) Fraudulent separation.

(a) That the accused was separated from an armed force; 

(b) That the accused knowingly misrepresented or deliberately concealed

a certain material fact or facts about the accused's eligibility for separation;

and 

(c) That the accused's separation was obtained or procured by that

knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

A fraudulent enlistment, appointment, or separation is one procured

 by either a knowingly false representation as to any of the qualifications

prescribed by law, regulation, or orders for the specific enlistment, appointment,

 or separation, or a deliberate concealment as to any of those disqualifications.

Matters that may be material to an enlistment, appointment, or separation

include any information used by the recruiting, appointing, or separating

 officer in reaching a decision as to enlistment, appointment, or separation

in any particular case, and any information that normally would have been

so considered had it been provided to that officer. 

### (2) Receipt of pay or allowances.

A member of the armed forces who enlists or accepts an appointment

 without being regularly separated from a prior enlistment or appointment

should be charged under Article 83 only if that member has received pay

or allowances under the fraudulent enlistment or appointment. Acceptance of

 food, clothing, shelter, or transportation from the government constitutes

receipt of allowances. However, whatever is furnished the accused while in

 custody, confinement, arrest, or other restraint pending trial for fraudulent

 enlistment or appointment is not considered an allowance. The receipt of

pay or allowances may be proved by circumstantial evidence. 

### (3) One offense.

One who procures one's own enlistment, appointment, or separation

by several misrepresentations or concealment as to qualifications for the

one enlistment, appointment, or separation so procured, commits only one

offense under Article 83. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Fraudulent enlistment or appointment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years. 

### (2) Fraudulent separation.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years.

#  Article 84-Effecting unlawful enlistment, appointment, or separation

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who effects an

enlistment or appointment in or a separation from the armed forces of any

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused effected the enlistment, appointment, or separation

 of the person named; 

(2) That this person was ineligible for this enlistment, appointment,

appointment, or separation. 

## c. Explanation.

It must be proved that the enlistment, appointment, or separation

was prohibited by law, regulation, or order when effected and that the accused

then knew that the person enlisted, appointed, or separated was ineligible

for the enlistment, appointment, or separation. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

 of duty;

(b) That the accused did so with the intent to avoid a certain duty

or shirk a certain service;

(d) That the accused remained absent until the date alleged.

--LSQP--Note: If the absence was terminated by apprehension, add the

 following element--RSQP--

(e) That the accused's absence was terminated by apprehension.

### (4) Attempted desertion.

(a) That the accused did a certain overt act;

(b) That the act was done with the specific intent to desert;

(c) That the act amounted to more than mere preparation; and

(d) That the act apparently tended to effect the commission of the

offense of desertion.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Desertion with intent to remain away permanently.

#### (a) In general.

Desertion with intent to remain away permanently is complete when

the person absents himself or herself without authority from his or her

unit, organization, or place of duty, with the intent to remain away therefrom

permanently. A prompt repentance and return, while material in extenuation,

is no defense. It is not necessary that the person be absent entirely from

military jurisdiction and control. 

#### (b) Absence without authority

-inception, duration, termination. _See_ paragraph

10c.

#### (c) Intent to remain away permanently.

(i) The intent to remain away permanently from the unit, organization,

 or place of duty may be formed any time during the unauthorized absence.

The intent need not exist throughout the absence, or for any particular

period of time, as long as it exists at some time during the absence.

(ii) The accused must have intended to remain away permanently from the

 unit, organization, or place of duty. When the accused had such an intent,

it is no defense that the accused also intended to report for duty elsewhere,

or to enlist or accept an appointment in the same or a different armed force.

(iii) The intent to remain away permanently may be established by circumstantial

evidence. Among the circumstances from which an inference may be drawn that

an accused intended to remain absent permanently are: that the period of absence

was lengthy; that the accused attempted to, or did, dispose of uniforms

or other military property; that the accused purchased a ticket for a distant

point or was arrested, apprehended, or surrendered a considerable distance

 from the accused's station; that the accused could have conveniently surrendered

to military control but did not; that the accused was dissatisfied with the

accused's unit, ship, or with military service; that the accused made remarks

indicating an intention to desert; that the accused was under charges or

 had escaped from confinement at the time of the absence; that the accused

made preparations indicative of an intent not to return (for example, financial

arrangements); or that the accused enlisted or accepted an appointment in

the same or another armed force without disclosing the fact that the accused

 had not been regularly separated, or entered any foreign armed service without

 being authorized by the United States. On the other hand, the following

are included in the circumstances which may tend to negate an inference

that the accused intended to remain away permanently: previous long and excellent

 service; that the accused left valuable personal property in the unit or

on the ship; or that the accused was under the influence of alcohol or drugs

during the absence. These lists are illustrative only. 

(iv) Entries on documents, such as personnel accountability records,

which administratively refer to an accused as a "deserter" are

not evidence of intent to desert. 

(v) Proof of, or a plea of guilty to, an unauthorized absence, even

of extended duration, does not, without more, prove guilt of desertion.

#### (d) Effect of enlistment or appointment in the same or a different armed

 force.

Article 85a(3) does not state a separate offense. Rather, it is

a rule of evidence by which the prosecution may prove intent to remain away

permanently. Proof of an enlistment or acceptance of an appointment in a

service without disclosing a preexisting duty status in the same or a different

 service provides the basis from which an inference of intent to permanently

 remain away from the earlier unit, organization, or place of duty may be

drawn. Furthermore, if a person, without being regularly separated from

one of the armed forces, enlists or accepts an appointment in the same or

another armed force, the person's presence in the military service under

such an enlistment or appointment is not a return to military control and

does not terminate any desertion or absence without authority from the earlier

unit or organization, unless the facts of the earlier period of service are

known to military authorities. If a person, while in desertion, enlists or

accepts an appointment in the same or another armed force, and deserts while

serving the enlistment or appointment, the person may be tried and convicted

for each desertion.

### (2) Quitting unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid

 hazardous duty or to shirk important service.

#### (a) Hazardous duty or important service.

"Hazardous duty" or "important service"

may include service such as duty in a combat or other dangerous area; embarkation

for certain foreign or sea duty; movement to a port of embarkation for that

purpose; entrainment for duty on the border or coast in time of war or threatened

invasion or other disturbances; strike or riot duty; or employment in aid

of the civil power in, for example, protecting property, or quelling or preventing

disorder in times of great public disaster. Such services as drill, target

practice, maneuvers, and practice marches are not ordinarily "hazardous

duty or important service." Whether a duty is hazardous or a service

is important depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and is

a question of fact for the court-martial to decide.

#### (b) Quits.

"Quits" in Article 85 means "goes absent without

 authority." 

#### (c) Actual knowledge.

Article 85 _a_(2) requires proof that the accused

 actually knew of the hazardous duty or important service. Actual knowledge

may be proved by circumstantial evidence. 

### (3) Attempting to desert.

Once the attempt is made, the fact that the person desists, voluntarily

or otherwise, does not cancel the offense. The offense is complete, for example,

if the person, intending to desert, hides in an empty freight car on a military

reservation, intending to escape by being taken away in the car. Entering

the car with the intent to desert is the overt act. For a more detailed

discussion of attempts, _see_ paragraph 4. For an explanation

 concerning intent to remain away permanently, _see_ paragraph

9c(1)(c). 

### (4) Prisoner with executed punitive discharge.

A prisoner whose dismissal or dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge

 has been executed is not a "member of the armed forces" within

the meaning of Articles 85 or 86, although the prisoner may still be subject

to military law under Article 2(_a_)(7). If the facts warrant,

such a prisoner could be charged with escape from confinement under Article

95 or an offense under Article 134.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Completed or attempted desertion with intent to avoid hazardous duty

or to shirk important service.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years. 

### (2) Other cases of completed or attempted desertion.

#### (a) Terminated by apprehension.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 3 years. 

#### (b) Terminated otherwise.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years. 

### (3) In time of war.

 Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.

## f. Sample specifications.

### (1) Desertion with intent to remain away permanently.

 

 In that  (personal jurisdiction

#  Article 86-Absence without leave

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any member of the armed forces who, without authority-**

(1) **fails to go to his appointed place of duty at the time prescribed;**

(2) **goes from that place; or**

(3) **absents himself or remains absent from his unit, organization, or

 place of duty at which he is required to be at the

 time prescribed;

 

shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Failure to go to appointed place of duty.

(a) That a certain authority appointed a certain time and place of duty

 for the accused;

(b) That the accused knew of that time and place; and

(c) That the accused, without authority, failed to go to the appointed

 place of duty at the time prescribed.

### (2) Going from appointed place of duty.

(a) That a certain authority appointed a certain time and place of duty

 for the accused;

(b) That the accused knew of that time and place; and

(c) That the accused, without authority, went from the appointed place

of duty after having reported at such place.

### (3) Absence from unit, organization, or place of duty.

(a) That the accused absented himself or herself from his or her unit,

 organization, or place of duty at which he or she was required to be;

(b) That the absence was without authority from anyone competent to

give him or her leave; and

(c) That the absence was for a certain period of time.

--LSQP--Note: if the absence was terminated by apprehension, add

the following element--RSQP--

(d) That the absence was terminated by apprehension.

### (4) Abandoning watch or guard.

(a) That the accused was a member of a guard, watch, or duty; 

(b) That the accused absented himself or herself from his or her guard,

 watch, or duty section;

(c) That absence of the accused was without authority; and

--LSQP--Note: If the absence was with intent to abandon the accused's

 guard, watch, or duty section, add the following element--RSQP--

 

(d) That the accused intended to abandon his or her guard, watch, or

duty section. 

### (5) Absence from unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid

maneuvers or field exercises.

(a) That the accused absented himself or herself from his or her unit,

 organization, or place of duty at which he or she was required to be;

(b) That the absence of the accused was without authority;

(c) That the absence was for a certain period of time;

(d) That the accused knew that the absence would occur during a part

of a period of maneuvers or field exercises; and

(e) That the accused intended to avoid all or part of a period of maneuvers

 or field exercises.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

This article is designed to cover every case not elsewhere provided

 for in which any member of the armed forces is through the member's own

fault not at the place where the member is required to be at a prescribed

time. It is not necessary that the person be absent entirely from military

 jurisdiction and control. The first part of this article-relating to

the appointed place of duty-applies whether the place is appointed

as a rendezvous for several or for one only. 

### (2) Actual knowledge.

The offenses of failure to go to and going from appointed place

of duty require proof that the accused actually knew of the appointed time

and place of duty. The offense of absence from unit, organization, or place

of duty with intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises requires proof

that the accused actually knew that the absence would occur during a part

of a period of maneuvers or field exercises. Actual knowledge may be proved

by circumstantial evidence.

### (3) Intent.

Specific intent is not an element of unauthorized absence. Specific

 intent is an element for certain aggravated unauthorized absences.

### (4) Aggravated forms of unauthorized absence.

There are variations of unauthorized absence under Article 86(3)

 which are more serious because of aggravating circumstances such as duration

of the absence, a special type of duty from which the accused absents himself

or herself, and a particular specific intent which accompanies the absence.

These circumstances are not essential elements of a violation of Article

86. They simply constitute special matters in aggravation. The following

are aggravated unauthorized absences:

(a) Unauthorized absence for more than 3 days (duration).

(b) Unauthorized absence for more than 30 days (duration).

(c) Unauthorized absence from a guard, watch, or duty (special type

of duty). 

(d) Unauthorized absence from guard, watch, or duty section with the

 intent to abandon it (special type of duty and specific intent).

(e) Unauthorized absence with the intent to avoid maneuvers or field

 exercises (special type of duty and specific intent).

### (5) Control by civilian authorities.

A member of the armed forces turned over to the civilian authorities

 upon request under Article 14 (_see_ R.C.M. 106) is not absent

without leave while held by them under that delivery. When a member of the

armed forces, being absent with leave, or absent without leave, is held,

tried, and acquitted by civilian authorities, the member's status as absent

with leave, or absent without leave, is not thereby changed, regardless

how long held. The fact that a member of the armed forces is convicted by

 the civilian authorities, or adjudicated to be a juvenile offender, or the

 case is "diverted" out of the regular criminal process for a

probationary period does not excuse any unauthorized absence, because the

member's inability to return was the result of willful misconduct. If a member

is released by the civilian authorities without trial, and was on authorized

leave at the time of arrest or detention, the member may be found guilty

of unauthorized absence only if it is proved that the member actually committed

 the offense for which detained, thus establishing that the absence was the

 result of the member's own misconduct. 

### (6) Inability to return.

The status of absence without leave is not changed by an inability

to return through sickness, lack of transportation facilities, or other

disabilities. But the fact that all or part of a period of unauthorized

absence was in a sense enforced or involuntary is a factor in extenuation

and should be given due weight when considering the initial disposition of

the offense. When, however, a person on authorized leave, without fault,

is unable to return at the expiration thereof, that person has not committed

the offense of absence without leave.

### (7) Determining the unit or organization of an accused.

A person undergoing transfer between activities is ordinarily considered

to be attached to the activity to which ordered to report. A person on temporary

additional duty continues as a member of the regularly assigned unit and

if the person is absent from the temporary duty assignment, the person becomes

absent without leave from both units, and may be charged with being absent

without leave from either unit.

### (8) Duration.

Unauthorized absence under Article 86(3) is an instantaneous offense.

 It is complete at the instant an accused absents himself or herself without

authority. Duration of the absence is a matter in aggravation for the purpose

of increasing the maximum punishment authorized for the offense. Even if

 the duration of the absence is not over 3 days, it is ordinarily alleged

in an Article 86(3) specification. If the duration is not alleged or if

alleged but not proved, an accused can be convicted of and punished for

only 1 day of unauthorized absence.

### (9) Computation of duration.

In computing the duration of an unauthorized absence, any one continuous

period of absence found that totals not more than 24 hours is counted as

1 day; any such period that totals more than 24 hours and not more than

48 hours is counted as 2 days, and so on. The hours of departure and return

 on different dates are assumed to be the same if not alleged and proved.

For example, if an accused is found guilty of unauthorized absence from

0600 hours, 4 April, to 1000 hours, 7 April of the same year (76 hours),

the maximum punishment would be based on an absence of 4 days. However, if

the accused is found guilty simply of unauthorized absence from 4 April to

7 April, the maximum punishment would be based on an absence of 3 days.

### (10) Termination-methods of return to military control.

#### (a) Surrender to military authority.

A surrender occurs when a person presents himself or herself to

any military authority, whether or not a member of the same armed force,

notifies that authority of his or her unauthorized absence status, and submits

or demonstrates a willingness to submit to military control. Such a surrender

terminates the unauthorized absence.

#### (b) Apprehension by military authority.

Apprehension by military authority of a known absentee terminates

an unauthorized absence. 

#### (c) Delivery to military authority.

Delivery of a known absentee by anyone to military authority terminates

the unauthorized absence. 

#### (d) Apprehension by civilian authorities at the request of the military.

When an absentee is taken into custody by civilian authorities at

the request of military authorities, the absence is terminated.

#### (e) Apprehension by civilian authorities without prior military request.

When an absentee is in the hands of civilian authorities for other

 reasons and these authorities make the absentee available for return to

military control, the absence is terminated when the military authorities

are informed of the absentee's availability.

### (11) Findings of more than one absence under one specification.

 unauthorized absences under one specification, provided that each absence

is included within the period alleged in the specification and provided

that the accused was not misled. If an accused is found guilty of two or

more unauthorized absences under a single specification, the maximum authorized

punishment shall not exceed that authorized if the accused had been found

guilty as charged in the specification.

#  Article 87-Missing movement

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who through

neglect or design misses the movement of a ship, aircraft, or unit with

which he is required in the course of duty to move shall be punished as

a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused was required in the course of duty to move with

a ship, aircraft or unit;

(2) That the accused knew of the prospective movement of the ship,

aircraft or unit; 

(3) That the accused missed the movement of the ship, aircraft or unit;

 and 

(4) That the accused missed the movement through design or neglect.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Movement.

"Movement" as used in Article 87 includes a move, transfer,

or shift of a ship, aircraft, or unit involving a substantial distance and

period of time. Whether a particular movement is substantial is a question

to be determined by the court-martial considering all the circumstances.

 Changes which do not constitute a "movement" include practice

 marches of a short duration with a return to the point of departure, and

minor changes in location of ships, aircraft, or units, as when a ship is

shifted from one berth to another in the same shipyard or harbor or when

a unit is moved from one barracks to another on the same post.

### (2) Mode of movement.

#### (a) Unit.

If a person is required in the course of duty to move with a unit,

 the mode of travel is not important, whether it be military or commercial,

and includes travel by ship, train, aircraft, truck, bus, or walking. The

word "unit" is not limited to any specific technical category

such as those listed in a table of organization and equipment, but also includes

units which are created before the movement with the intention that they

have organizational continuity upon arrival at their destination regardless

of their technical designation, and units intended to be disbanded upon arrival

at their destination. 

#### (b) Ship, aircraft.

If a person is assigned as a crew member or is ordered to move as

a passenger aboard a particular ship or aircraft, military or chartered,

then missing the particular sailing or flight is essential to establish

the offense of missing movement. 

### (3) Design.

"Design" means on purpose, intentionally, or according

 to plan and requires specific intent to miss the movement. 

### (4) Neglect.

"Neglect" means the omission to take such measures as

are appropriate under the circumstances to assure presence with a ship,

aircraft, or unit at the time of a scheduled movement, or doing some act

without giving attention to its probable consequences in connection with

the prospective movement, such as a departure from the vicinity of the prospective

movement to such a distance as would make it likely that one could not return

in time for the movement.

### (5) Actual knowledge.

In order to be guilty of the offense, the accused must have actually

 known of the prospective movement that was missed. Knowledge of the exact

hour or even of the exact date of the scheduled movement is not required.

It is sufficient if the approximate date was known by the accused as long

as there is a causal connection between the conduct of the accused and the

missing of the scheduled movement. Knowledge may be proved by circumstantial

evidence.

### (6) Proof of absence.

 That the accused actually missed the movement may be proved by

 documentary evidence, as by a proper entry in a log or a morning report.

This fact may also be proved by the testimony of personnel of the ship,

aircraft, or unit (or by other evidence) that the movement occurred at a

certain time, together with evidence that the accused was physically elsewhere

at that time.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Design.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years. 

### (2) Neglect.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

## f. Sample specification.

 

 In that  (personal jurisdiction

data), did,  (at/on  board-location),  on or

about  20 , through (neglect) (design) miss the movement of

(Aircraft No.  ) (Flight  ) (the

USS  ) (Company A, 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry) ( ) with which he/she was required in the course of duty

to move.

#  Article 88-Contempt toward officials

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any commissioned officer who uses contemptuous

words against the President, the Vice President, Congress, the Secretary

of Defense, the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Homeland Security,

or the Governor or legislature of any State, Territory, Commonwealth, or

 possession in which he is on duty or present shall be punished as a court-martial

may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused was a commissioned officer of the United States

armed forces;

(2) That the accused used certain words against an official or legislature

 named in the article;

(3) That by an act of the accused these words came to the knowledge

of a person other than the accused; and

(4) That the words used were contemptuous, either in themselves or by

 virtue of the circumstances under which they were used.

--LSQP--Note: If the words were against a Governor or legislature,

add the following element--RSQP--

(5) That the accused was then present in the State, Territory, Commonwealth,

or possession of the Governor or legislature concerned.

## c. Explanation.

The official or legislature against whom the words are used must

be occupying one of the offices or be one of the legislatures named in Article

88 at the time of the offense. Neither "Congress" nor "legislature"

includes its members individually. "Governor" does not include

 "lieutenant governor." It is immaterial whether the words are

used against the official in an official or private capacity. If not personally

contemptuous, adverse criticism of one of the officials or legislatures

named in the article in the course of a political discussion, even though

emphatically expressed, may not be charged as a violation of the article.

Similarly, expressions of opinion made in a purely private conversation

should not ordinarily be charged. Giving broad circulation to a written publication

containing contemptuous words of the kind made punishable by this article,

or the utterance of contemptuous words of this kind in the presence of military

subordinates, aggravates the offense. The truth or falsity of the statements

 is immaterial.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement

for 1 year.

## f. Sample specification.

 

 In that  (personal jurisdiction

data), did,  (at/on  board-location),  on or

about  20 , --LSQP--use (orally and publicly)

() the following contemptuous words--RSQP-- --LSQP--in a contemptuous

manner, use (orally and publicly) () the following

words--RSQP-- against the --LSQP--(President) (Vice President) (Congress)

#  Article 89-Disrespect toward a superior commissioned officer

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who behaves

with disrespect toward his superior commissioned officer shall be punished

as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused did or omitted certain acts or used certain language

 to or concerning a certain commissioned officer;

(2) That such behavior or language was directed toward that officer;

(3) That the officer toward whom the acts, omissions, or words were

 directed was the superior commissioned officer of the accused;

(4) That the accused then knew that the commissioned officer toward

whom the acts, omissions, or words were directed was the accused's superior

 commissioned officer; and

(5) That, under the circumstances, the behavior or language was disrespectful

 to that commissioned officer.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Superior commissioned officer.

#### (a) Accused and victim in same uniformed service.

If the accused and the victim are in the same uniformed service, the victim

 is a "superior commissioned officer" of the accused when either

superior in rank or command to the accused; however, the victim is not a

"superior commissioned officer" of the accused if the victim

 is inferior in command, even though superior in rank.

#### (b) Accused and victim in different uniformed service.

If the accused and the victim are in different uniformed services, the

 victim is a "superior commissioned officer" of the accused when

the victim is a commissioned officer and superior in the chain of command

over the accused or when the victim, not a medical officer or a chaplain,

is senior in grade to the accused and both are detained by a hostile entity

so that recourse to the normal chain of command is prevented. The victim

is not a "superior commissioned officer" of the accused merely

 because the victim is superior in grade to the accused.

#### (c) Execution of office.

It is not necessary that the "superior commissioned officer"

be in the execution of office at the time of the disrespectful behavior.

### (2) Knowledge.

If the accused did not know that the person against whom the acts

or words were directed was the accused's superior commissioned officer,

the accused may not be convicted of a violation of this article. Knowledge

may be proved by circumstantial evidence.

### (3) Disrespect.

Disrespectful behavior is that which detracts from the respect due

 the authority and person of a superior commissioned officer. It may consist

of acts or language, however expressed, and it is immaterial whether they

refer to the superior as an officer or as a private individual. Disrespect

by words may be conveyed by abusive epithets or other contemptuous or denunciatory

language. Truth is no defense. Disrespect by acts includes neglecting the

customary salute, or showing a marked disdain, indifference, insolence,

impertinence, undue familiarity, or other rudeness in the presence of the

 superior officer.

### (4) Presence.

It is not essential that the disrespectful behavior be in the presence

of the superior, but ordinarily one should not be held accountable under

this article for what was said or done in a purely private conversation.

### (5) Special defense-unprotected victim.

A superior commissioned officer whose conduct in relation to the

 accused under all the circumstances departs substantially from the required

standards appropriate to that officer's rank or position under similar circumstances

loses the protection of this article. That accused may not be convicted

of being disrespectful to the officer who has so lost the entitlement to

respect protected by Article 89.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year.

## f. Sample specification.

 

 In that  (personal jurisdiction

data), did,  (at/on  board-location),  on or about

 20 , behave himself/herself with disrespect toward  , his/her superior commissioned officer, then known by

the said  to be his/her superior commissioned officer,

by (saying to him/her "  ," or words to

that effect) (contemptuously turning from and leaving him/her while he/she,

the said  , was talking to him/her, the said  ) (  ).

#  Article 90-Assaulting or willfully disobeying superior commissioned

officer

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who-**

(1) **strikes his superior commissioned officer or draws or lifts up

any weapon or offers any violence against him while he is in the execution

of his office; or**

(2) **willfully disobeys a lawful command of his superior commissioned

 officer; 

shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of

war, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, and

if the offense is committed at any other time, by such punishment, other

 than death, as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Striking or assaulting superior commissioned officer.

(a) That the accused struck, drew, or lifted up a weapon against, or

 offered violence against, a certain commissioned officer;

(b) That the officer was the superior commissioned officer of the accused;

(c) That the accused then knew that the officer was the accused's superior

 commissioned officer; and

(d) That the superior commissioned officer was then in the execution

of office. 

### (2) Disobeying superior commissioned officer.

(a) That the accused received a lawful command from a certain commissioned

officer; 

(b) That this officer was the superior commissioned officer of the

accused; 

(c) That the accused then knew that this officer was the accused's

superior commissioned officer; and

(d) That the accused willfully disobeyed the lawful command.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Striking or assaulting superior commissioned officer.

#### (a) Definitions.

##### (i) Superior commissioned officer.

The definitions in paragraph

13c(1)(_a_) and (_b_) apply here and in subparagraph c(2).

##### (ii) Strikes.

"Strikes" means an intentional blow, and includes any

 offensive touching of the person of an officer, however slight.

##### (iii) Draws or lifts up any weapon against.

The phrase "draws or lifts up any weapon against" covers

 any simple assault committed in the manner stated. The drawing of any weapon

in an aggressive manner or the raising or brandishing of the same in a threatening

manner in the presence of and at the superior is the sort of act proscribed.

The raising in a threatening manner of a firearm, whether or not loaded,

of a club, or of anything by which a serious blow or injury could be given

is included in "lifts up."

##### (iv) Offers any violence against.

The phrase "offers any violence against" includes any

 form of battery or of mere assault not embraced in the preceding more specific

terms "strikes" and "draws or lifts up." If not

executed, the violence must be physically attempted or menaced. A mere threatening

in words is not an offering of violence in the sense of this article.

#### (b) Execution of office.

An officer is in the execution of office when engaged in any act

or service required or authorized by treaty, statute, regulation, the order

of a superior, or military usage. In general, any striking or use of violence

against any superior officer by a person over whom it is the duty of that

officer to maintain discipline at the time, would be striking or using violence

against the officer in the execution of office. The commanding officer on

board a ship or the commanding officer of a unit in the field is generally

considered to be on duty at all times.

#### (c) Knowledge.

If the accused did not know the officer was the accused's superior

 commissioned officer, the accused may not be convicted of this offense.

Knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence.

#### (d) Defenses.

In a prosecution for striking or assaulting a superior commissioned

 officer in violation of this article, it is a defense that the accused acted

in the proper discharge of some duty, or that the victim behaved in a manner

toward the accused such as to lose the protection of this article

(_see_ paragraph 13c(5)). For example, if the victim initiated an unlawful

attack on the accused, this would deprive the victim of the protection of

this article, and, in addition, could excuse any lesser included offense

of assault as done in self-defense, depending on the circumstances

(_see_ paragraph 54c; R.C.M. 916(_e_)).

### (2) Disobeying superior commissioned officer.

#### (a) Lawfulness of the order.

##### (i) Inference of lawfulness.

An order requiring the performance of a military duty or act may

be inferred to be lawful and it is disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate.

This inference does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as one that

directs the commission of a crime.

##### (ii) Determination of lawfulness.

The lawfulness of an order is a question of law to be determined by the military judge.

##### (iii) Authority of issuing officer.

The commissioned officer issuing the order must have authority to

 give such an order. Authorization may be based on law, regulation, or custom

of the service.

##### (iv) Relationship to military duty.

The order must relate to military duty, which includes all activities

 reasonably necessary to accomplish a military mission, or safeguard or promote

the morale, discipline, and usefulness of members of a command and directly

connected with the maintenance of good order in the service. The order may

not, without such a valid military purpose, interfere with private rights

or personal affairs. However, the dictates of a person's conscience, religion,

or personal philosophy cannot justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise

lawful order. Disobedience of an order which has for its sole object the

attainment of some private end, or which is given for the sole purpose of

increasing the penalty for an offense which it is expected the accused may

commit, is not punishable under this article.

##### (v) Relationship to statutory or constitutional rights.

The order must not conflict with the statutory or constitutional

 rights of the person receiving the order.

#### (b) Personal nature of the order.

The order must be directed specifically to the subordinate. Violations

of regulations, standing orders or directives, or failure to perform previously

established duties are not punishable under this article, but may violate

Article 92.

#### (c) Form and transmission of the order.

As long as the order is understandable, the form of the order is

 immaterial, as is the method by which it is transmitted to the accused.

#### (d) Specificity of the order.

The order must be a specific mandate to do or not to do a specific

 act. An exhortation to "obey the law" or to perform one's military

duty does not constitute an order under this article. 

#### (e) Knowledge.

The accused must have actual knowledge of the order and of the fact

 that the person issuing the order was the accused's superior commissioned

officer. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence. 

#### (f) Nature of the disobedience.

"Willful disobedience" is an intentional defiance of

 authority. Failure to comply with an order through heedlessness, remissness,

or forgetfulness is not a violation of this article but may violate Article

92.

#### (g) Time for compliance.

When an order requires immediate compliance, an accused's declared intent not to obey and the failure to make any move to comply constitutes disobedience. Immediate compliance is required for any order that does not explicitly or implicitly indicate that delayed compliance is authorized or directed. If an order requires performance in the future, an accused's present statement of intention to disobey the order does not constitute disobedience of that order, although carrying out that intention may. 

### (3) Civilians and discharged prisoners.

A discharged prisoner or other civilian subject to military law

 (_see_ Article 2) and under the command of a commissioned

officer is subject to the provisions of this article.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Striking, drawing, or lifting up any weapon or offering any violence

to superior commissioned officer in the execution of office.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years.

### (2) Willfully disobeying a lawful order of superior commissioned officer.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years. 

### (3) In time of war.

Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.

## f. Sample specifications.

#  Article 91-Insubordinate conduct toward warrant officer, noncommissioned

officer, or petty officer

(3) **treats with contempt or is disrespectful in language or deportment

 toward a warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, or petty officer while

that officer is in the execution of his office; shall be punished as a court-martial

may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Striking or assaulting warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer.

(a) That the accused was a warrant officer or enlisted member;

(b) That the accused struck or assaulted a certain warrant, noncommissioned,

 or petty officer;

(c) That the striking or assault was committed while the victim was

in the execution of office; and

(d) That the accused then knew that the person struck or assaulted was

a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer.

--LSQP--Note: If the victim was the superior noncommissioned or petty

 officer of the accused, add the following elements--RSQP--

(e) That the victim was the superior noncommissioned, or petty officer

of the accused; and

(f) That the accused then knew that the person struck or assaulted was

 the accused's superior noncommissioned, or petty officer.

a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer;

(d) That the accused had a duty to obey the order; and

(e) That the accused willfully disobeyed the order.

### (3) Treating with contempt or being disrespectful in language or deportment

(g) That the victim was the superior noncommissioned, or petty officer

of the accused; and

(h) That the accused then knew that the person toward whom the behavior

 or language was directed was the accused's superior noncommissioned, or petty

 officer.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

Article 91 has the same general objects with respect to warrant,

 noncommissioned, and petty officers as Articles 89 and 90 have with respect

to commissioned officers, namely, to ensure obedience to their lawful orders,

and to protect them from violence, insult, or disrespect. Unlike Articles

89 and 90, however, this article does not require a superior-subordinate

relationship as an element of any of the offenses denounced. This article

does not protect an acting noncommissioned officer or acting petty officer,

nor does it protect military police or members of the shore patrol who are

not warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officers. 

### (2) Knowledge.

All of the offenses prohibited by Article 91 require that the accused

 have actual knowledge that the victim was a warrant, noncommissioned, or

petty officer. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence.

### (3) Striking or assaulting a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer.

For a discussion of "strikes" and "in the execution

 of office," _see_ paragraph 14c. For a discussion of

"assault," see paragraph 54c. An assault by a prisoner who has

been discharged from the service, or by any other civilian subject to military

law, upon a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer should be charged

under Article 128 or 134.

### (4) Disobeying a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer.

 _See_ paragraph 14c(2) for a discussion of lawfulness,

personal nature, form, transmission, and specificity of the order, nature

of the disobedience, and time for compliance with the order. 

### (5) Treating with contempt or being disrespectful in language or deportment

 toward a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer.

"Toward" requires that the behavior and language be

 within the sight or hearing of the warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer

concerned. For a discussion of "in the execution of his office," _

see_ paragraph 14c. For a discussion of disrespect, _see_

paragraph 13c.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

 (Note: In cases where the dereliction of duty resulted in death or grievous bodily harm, add the following as applicable)

(d) That such dereliction of duty resulted in death or grievous bodily harm to a person other than the accused.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Violation of or failure to obey a lawful general order or regulation.

#### (a)  Authority to issue general orders and regulations.

General orders or regulations are those orders or regulations generally

applicable to an armed force which are properly published by the President

or the Secretary of Defense, of Homeland Security, or of a military department,

and those orders or regulations generally applicable to the command of the

officer issuing them throughout the command or a particular subdivision thereof

which are issued by:

(i) an officer having general court-martial jurisdiction;

(ii) a general or flag officer in command; or

(iii) a commander superior to (i) or (ii).

#### (b)  Effect of change of command on validity of order.

A general order or regulation issued by a commander with authority

 under Article 92(1) retains its character as a general order or regulation

when another officer takes command, until it expires by its own terms or

is rescinded by separate action, even if it is issued by an officer who is

a general or flag officer in command and command is assumed by another officer

who is not a general or flag officer.

#### (c)  Lawfulness.

A general order or regulation is lawful unless it is contrary to

the Constitution, the laws of the United States, or lawful superior orders

or for some other reason is beyond the authority of the official issuing

it. _See_ the discussion of lawfulness in paragraph 14c(2)(a).

#### (d) Knowledge.

Knowledge of a general order or regulation need not be alleged or

 proved, as knowledge is not an element of this offense and a lack of knowledge

does not constitute a defense.

#### (e) Enforceability.

Not all provisions in general orders or regulations can be enforced

 under Article 92(1). Regulations which only supply general guidelines or

advice for conducting military functions may not be enforceable under Article

92(1).

### (2) Violation of or failure to obey other lawful order.

#### (a) Scope.

Article 92(2) includes all other lawful orders which may be issued

by a member of the armed forces, violations of which are not chargeable

under Article 90, 91, or 92(1). It includes the violation of written regulations

which are not general regulations. _See also_ subparagraph

(1)(e) above as applicable. 

#### (b) Knowledge.

In order to be guilty of this offense, a person must have had actual

 knowledge of the order or regulation. Knowledge of the order may be proved

by circumstantial evidence.

#### (c) Duty to obey order.

##### (i) From a superior.

A member of one armed force who is senior in rank to a member of

 another armed force is the superior of that member with authority to issue

orders which that member has a duty to obey under the same circumstances

 as a commissioned officer of one armed force is the superior commissioned

 officer of a member of another armed force for the purposes of Articles

89 and 90. _See_ paragraph 13c(1).

##### (ii) From one not a superior.

Failure to obey the lawful order of one not a superior is an offense

 under Article 92(2), provided the accused had a duty to obey the order,

such as one issued by a sentinel or a member of the armed forces police. _

See_ paragraph 15b(2) if the order was issued by a warrant, noncommissioned,

or petty officer in the execution of office.

### (3) Dereliction in the performance of duties.

#### (a) Duty.

A duty may be imposed by treaty, statute, regulation, lawful order,

 standard operating procedure, or custom of the service.

#### (b) Knowledge.

Actual knowledge of duties may be proved by circumstantial evidence.

 Actual knowledge need not be shown if the individual reasonably should have

known of the duties. This may be demonstrated by regulations, training or

operating manuals, customs of the service, academic literature or testimony,

testimony of persons who have held similar or superior positions, or similar

evidence.

#### (c) Derelict.

A person is derelict in the performance of duties when that person

 willfully or negligently fails to perform that person's duties or when that

person performs them in a culpably inefficient manner. "Willfully"

means intentionally. It refers to the doing of an act knowingly and purposely,

 specifically intending the natural and probable consequences of the act.

 "Negligently" means an act or omission of a person who is under

a duty to use due care which exhibits a lack of that degree of care which

a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar

circumstances. "Culpable inefficiency" is inefficiency for which

there is no reasonable or just excuse. 

#### (d) Ineptitude.

A person is not derelict in the performance of duties if the failure

 to perform those duties is caused by ineptitude rather than by willfulness,

negligence, or culpable inefficiency, and may not be charged under this

article, or otherwise punished. For example, a recruit who has tried earnestly

during rifle training and throughout record firing is not derelict in the

performance of duties if the recruit fails to qualify with the weapon.

(e) Grievous bodily harm. "Grievous bodily harm" means serious bodily injury. It does not include minor injuries, such as a black eye or a bloody nose, but does include fractured or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members of the body, serious damage to internal organs, and other serious bodily injuries.

(f) Where the dereliction of duty resulted in death or grievous bodily harm, an intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm is not required.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Violation of or failure to obey lawful general order or regulation.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years. 

### (2) Violation of or failure to obey other lawful order.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 6 months.

--LSQP--Note: For (1) and (2), above, the punishment set forth does

not apply in the following cases: if in the absence of the order or regulation

 which was violated or not obeyed the accused would on the same facts be

subject to conviction for another specific offense for which a lesser punishment

is prescribed; or if the violation or failure to obey is a breach of restraint

imposed as a result of an order. In these instances, the maximum punishment

is that specifically prescribed elsewhere for that particular offense.--RSQP--

### (3) Dereliction in the performance of duties.

#### (A) Through neglect or culpable inefficiency.

Forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for 3 months and confinement

 for 3 months.

#### (B) Through neglect or culpable inefficiency resulting in death or grievous bodily harm. 

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 18 months.

#### (C) Willful.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 6 months.

#### (D) Willful dereliction of duty resulting in death or grievous bodily harm.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years.

(Note: For (1) and (2) above, the punishment set forth does not apply in the following cases: if, in the absence of the order or regulation which was violated or not obeyed, the accused would on the same facts be subject to conviction for another specific offense for which a lesser punishment is prescribed; or if the violation or failure to obey is a breach of restraint imposed as a result of an order. In these instances, the maximum punishment is that specifically prescribed elsewhere for that particular offense.)

####  Discussion

 If the dereliction of duty resulted in death, the accused may also be charged under Article 119 or Article 134 (negligent homicide), as applicable.

## f. Sample specifications.

#  Article 93-Cruelty and maltreatment

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who is guilty

of cruelty toward, or oppression or maltreatment of, any person subject

to his orders shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That a certain person was subject to the orders of the accused;

and 

(2) That the accused was cruel toward, or oppressed, or maltreated that

 person. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Nature of victim.

"Any person subject to his orders" means not only those

 persons under the direct or immediate command of the accused but extends

to all persons, subject to the code or not, who by reason of some duty are

required to obey the lawful orders of the accused, regardless whether the

accused is in the direct chain of command over the person.

### (2) Nature of act.

The cruelty, oppression, or maltreatment, although not necessarily

 physical, must be measured by an objective standard. Assault, improper punishment,

and sexual harassment may constitute this offense. Sexual harassment includes

influencing, offering to influence, or threatening the career, pay, or job

of another person in exchange for sexual favors, and deliberate or repeated

 offensive comments or gestures of a sexual nature. The imposition of necessary

or proper duties and the exaction of their performance does not constitute

this offense even though the duties are arduous or hazardous or both.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years.

 in concert with any other person, to obey orders or otherwise do his duty

or creates any violence or disturbance is guilty of mutiny;**

(2) **with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of lawful civil

 authority, creates, in concert with any other person, revolt, violence,

or other disturbance against that authority is guilty of sedition;**

(3) **fails to do his utmost to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition

### (1) Mutiny by creating violence or disturbance.

(a) That the accused created violence or a disturbance; and

(b) That the accused created this violence or disturbance with intent

to usurp or override lawful military authority.

### (2) Mutiny by refusing to obey orders or perform duty.

(a) That the accused refused to obey orders or otherwise do the accused's

 duty; 

(b) That the accused in refusing to obey orders or perform duty acted

in concert with another person or persons; and

(c) That the accused did so with intent to usurp or override lawful

### (5) Failure to report a mutiny or sedition.

(a) That an offense of mutiny or sedition occurred;

(b) That the accused knew or had reason to believe that the offense

was taking place; and

(c) That the accused failed to take all reasonable means to inform the

 accused's superior commissioned officer or commander of the offense.

### (6) Attempted mutiny.

(a) That the accused committed a certain overt act;

(b) That the act was done with specific intent to commit the offense

of mutiny; 

(c) That the act amounted to more than mere preparation; and

(d) That the act apparently tended to effect the commission of the

offense of mutiny. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Mutiny.

Article 94(_a_)(1) defines two types of mutiny, both

 requiring an intent to usurp or override military authority.

#### (a) Mutiny by creating violence or disturbance.

Mutiny by creating violence or disturbance may be committed by one

 person acting alone or by more than one acting together.

#### (b) Mutiny by refusing to obey orders or perform duties.

Mutiny by refusing to obey orders or perform duties requires collective

insubordination and necessarily includes some combination of two or more

persons in resisting lawful military authority. This concert of insubordination

need not be preconceived, nor is it necessary that the insubordination be

active or violent. It may consist simply of a persistent and concerted refusal

or omission to obey orders, or to do duty, with an insubordinate intent,

that is, with an intent to usurp or override lawful military authority.

The intent may be declared in words or inferred from acts, omissions, or

surrounding circumstances. 

### (2) Sedition.

Sedition requires a concert of action in resistance to civil authority.

This differs from mutiny by creating violence or disturbance. _See

_ subparagraph c(1)(_a_) above. 

### (3) Failure to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition.

"Utmost" means taking those measures to prevent and

 suppress a mutiny or sedition which may properly be called for by the circumstances,

including the rank, responsibilities, or employment of the person concerned.

"Utmost" includes the use of such force, including deadly force,

as may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances to prevent and suppress

a mutiny or sedition.

### (4) Failure to report a mutiny or sedition.

Failure to "take all reasonable means to inform" includes

 failure to take the most expeditious means available. When the circumstances

known to the accused would have caused a reasonable person in similar circumstances

to believe that a mutiny or sedition was occurring, this may establish that

the accused had such "reason to believe" that mutiny or sedition

was occurring. Failure to report an impending mutiny or sedition is not an

offense in violation of Article 94. _But see _ paragraph 16c(3)

(dereliction of duty).

### (5) Attempted mutiny.

For a discussion of attempts, see paragraph 4.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

For all offenses under Article 94, death or such other punishment

as a court-martial may direct. 

## f. Sample specifications.

### (1) Mutiny by creating violence or disturbance.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

#  Article 95-Resistance, flight, breach of arrest, and escape

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who-**

(1) **resists apprehension;**

(2) **flees from apprehension;**

(3) **breaks arrest; or**

(4) **escapes from custody or confinement;

shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

### (1) Resisting apprehension.

(a) That a certain person attempted to apprehend the accused;

(b) That said person was authorized to apprehend the accused; and

(c) That the accused actively resisted the apprehension.

### (2) Flight from apprehension.

(a) That a certain person attempted to apprehend the accused;

(b) That said person was authorized to apprehend the accused; and

(c) That the accused fled from the appre- hension.

### (3) Breaking arrest.

(a) That a certain person ordered the accused into arrest;

(b) That said person was authorized to order the accused into arrest;

and 

(c) That the accused went beyond the limits of arrest before being

released from that arrest by proper authority.

### (4) Escape from custody.

(a) That a certain person apprehended the accused;

(b) That said person was authorized to apprehend the accused; and

(c) That the accused freed himself or herself from custody before being

 released by proper authority.

### (5) Escape from confinement.

(a) That a certain person ordered the accused into confinement;

(b) That said person was authorized to order the accused into confinement;

and 

(c) That the accused freed himself or herself from confinement before

 being released by proper authority.

--LSQP--Note: If the escape was post-trial confinement, add the following

 element--RSQP--

 

(d) That the confinement was the result of a court-martial conviction.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Resisting apprehension.

#### (a) Apprehension.

Apprehension is the taking of a person into custody. _ See

_ R.C.M. 302.

#### (b) Authority to apprehend.

 _See_ R.C.M. 302(_b_) concerning

who may apprehend. Whether the status of a person authorized that person

to apprehend the accused is a question of law to be decided by the military

judge. Whether the person who attempted to make an apprehension had such

a status is a question of fact to be decided by the factfinder.

#### (c) Nature of the resistance.

The resistance must be active, such as assaulting the person attempting

to apprehend. Mere words of opposition, argument, or abuse, and attempts

to escape from custody after the apprehension is complete, do not constitute

the offense of resisting apprehension although they may constitute other

offenses.

#### (d) Mistake.

It is a defense that the accused held a reasonable belief that the

 person attempting to apprehend did not have authority to do so. However,

the accused's belief at the time that no basis exists for the apprehension

 is not a defense.

#### (e) Illegal apprehension.

A person may not be convicted of resisting apprehension if the

attempted apprehension is illegal, but may be convicted of other offenses,

such as assault, depending on all the circumstances. An attempted apprehension

by a person authorized to apprehend is presumed to be legal in the absence

of evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily the legality of an apprehension is

a question of law to be decided by the military judge. 

### (2) Flight from apprehension.

The flight must be active, such as running or driving away.

### (3) Breaking arrest.

#### (a) Arrest.

There are two types of arrest: pretrial arrest under Article 9

(_see_ R.C.M. 304) and arrest under Article 15 (_see

_ paragraph 5c(3), Part V, MCM). This article prohibits breaking

any arrest.

#### (b) Authority to order arrest.

 _See_ R.C.M. 304(b) and paragraphs 2 and 5b, Part

V, MCM concerning authority to order arrest.

#### (c) Nature of restraint imposed by arrest.

In arrest, the restraint is moral restraint imposed by orders fixing

 the limits of arrest. 

#### (d) Breaking.

Breaking arrest is committed when the person in arrest infringes

the limits set by orders. The reason for the infringement is immaterial.

For example, innocence of the offense with respect to which an arrest may

have been imposed is not a defense.

#### (e) Illegal arrest.

A person may not be convicted of breaking arrest if the arrest is

 illegal. An arrest ordered by one authorized to do so is presumed to be

legal in the absence of some evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily, the legality

of an arrest is a question of law to be decided by the military judge.

### (4) Escape from custody.

#### (a) Custody.

"Custody" is restraint of free locomotion imposed by

 lawful apprehension. The restraint may be physical or, once there has been

a submission to apprehension or a forcible taking into custody, it may consist

of control exercised in the presence of the prisoner by official acts or

orders. Custody is temporary restraint intended to continue until other restraint

(arrest, restriction, confinement) is imposed or the person is released.

#### (b) Authority to apprehend.

 _See_ subparagraph (1)(_b_) above.

#### (c) Escape.

For a discussion of escape, _see_ subparagraph

c(5)(_c_), below. 

#### (d) Illegal custody.

A person may not be convicted of this offense if the custody was

 illegal. An apprehension effected by one authorized to apprehend is presumed

to be lawful in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily, the

legality of an apprehension is a question of law to be decided by the military

judge.

#### (e) Correctional custody.

 _See_ paragraph 70.

### (5) Escape from confinement.

#### (a) Confinement.

Confinement is physical restraint imposed under R.C.M. 305, 1101,

or paragraph 5b, Part V, MCM. For purposes of the element of post-trial

confinement (subparagraph b(5)(d), above) and increased punishment therefrom

(subparagraph e(4), below), the confinement must have been imposed pursuant

to an adjudged sentence of a court-martial and not as a result of pretrial

restraint or nonjudicial punishment.

#### (b) Authority to order confinement.

 _See_ R.C.M. 304(b); 1101; and

paragraphs 2 and 5b, Part V, MCM concerning who may order confinement.

#### (c) Escape.

An escape may be either with or without force or artifice, and either

 with or without the consent of the custodian. However, where a prisoner

is released by one with apparent authority to do so, the prisoner may not

be convicted of escape from confinement. _See also_ paragraph

20c(1)(b). Any completed casting off of the restraint of confinement, before

release by proper authority, is an escape, and lack of effectiveness of

the restraint imposed is immaterial. An escape is not complete until the

prisoner is momentarily free from the restraint. If the movement toward escape

is opposed, or before it is completed, an immediate pursuit follows, there

is no escape until opposition is overcome or pursuit is eluded.

#### (d) Status when temporarily outside confinement facility.

A prisoner who is temporarily escorted outside a confinement facility

 for a work detail or other reason by a guard, who has both the duty and

means to prevent that prisoner from escaping, remains in confinement. 

#### (e) Legality of confinement.

A person may not be convicted of escape from confinement if the

 confinement is illegal. Confinement ordered by one authorized to do so is

presumed to be lawful in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily,

the legality of confinement is a question of law to be decided by the military

judge.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Resisting apprehension.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year.

### (2) Flight from apprehension.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year.

### (3) Breaking arrest.

 confinement for 6 months.

### (4) Escape from custody, pretrial confinement, or confinement on bread

and water or diminished rations imposed pursuant to Article 15.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year.

### (5) Escape from post-trial confinement.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years.

#  Article 96-Releasing prisoner without proper authority

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, without

proper authority, releases any prisoner committed to his charge, or who

through neglect or design suffers any such prisoner to escape, shall be

punished as a court-martial may direct, whether or not the prisoner was committed

in strict compliance with law.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Releasing a prisoner without proper authority.

(a) That a certain prisoner was committed to the charge of the accused;

and

(b) That the accused released the prisoner without proper authority.

### (2) Suffering a prisoner to escape through neglect.

(a) That a certain prisoner was committed to the charge of the accused;

(b) That the prisoner escaped;

(c) That the accused did not take such care to prevent the escape as

a reasonably careful person, acting in the capacity in which the accused

was acting, would have taken in the same or similar circumstances; and

(d) That the escape was the proximate result of the neglect.

### (3) Suffering a prisoner to escape through design.

(a) That a certain prisoner was committed to the charge of the accused;

(b) That the design of the accused was to suffer the escape of that

 prisoner; and 

(c) That the prisoner escaped as a result of the carrying out of the

 design of the accused.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Releasing a prisoner without proper authority.

#### (a) Prisoner.

"Prisoner" includes a civilian or military person who

has been confined.

#### (b) Release.

The release of a prisoner is removal of restraint by the custodian

 rather than by the prisoner. 

#### (c) Authority to release.

 _See_ R.C.M. 305(_g_) as to who may

release pretrial prisoners. Normally, the lowest authority competent to

order release of a post-trial prisoner is the commander who convened the

court-martial which sentenced the prisoner or the officer exercising general

court-martial jurisdiction over the prisoner. _See also_ R.C.M.

 1101.

#### (d) Committed.

Once a prisoner has been confined, the prisoner has been "committed"

in the sense of Article 96, and only a competent authority (_see_

subparagraph (c)) may order release, regardless of failure

to follow procedures prescribed by the code, this Manual, or other law.

### (2) Suffering a prisoner to escape through neglect.

#### (a) Suffer.

"Suffer" means to allow or permit; not to forbid or

 hinder.

#### (b) Neglect.

"Neglect" is a relative term. It is the absence of

conduct which would have been taken by a reasonably careful person in the

same or similar circumstances.

#### (c) Escape.

Escape is defined in paragraph 19.c.(4)(c).

#### (d) Status of prisoner after escape not a defense.

After escape, the fact that a prisoner returns, is captured, killed,

 or otherwise dies is not a defense. 

### (3) Suffering a prisoner to escape through design.

An escape is suffered through design when it is intended. Such intent

 may be inferred from conduct so wantonly devoid of care that the only reasonable

inference which may be drawn is that the escape was contemplated as a probable

result.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Releasing a prisoner without proper authority.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years. 

### (2) Suffering a prisoner to escape through neglect.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

### (3) Suffering a prisoner to escape through design.

 confinement for 2 years.

(c) That the accused knew that the accused was charged with this duty;

 and 

(d) That the accused's failure to enforce or comply with that provision

 was intentional. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Unnecessary delay in disposing of case.

 The purpose of section (1) of Article 98 is to ensure expeditious

 disposition of cases of persons accused of offenses under the code. A person

 to the accused's mission; 

(c) That the accused failed to afford all practicable relief and assistance;

and 

(d) That, at the time, the accused was before or in the presence of

the enemy. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Running away.

#### (a) Running away.

"Running away" means an unauthorized departure to avoid

 actual or impending combat. It need not, however, be the result of fear,

and there is no requirement that the accused literally run. 

#### (b) Enemy.

"Enemy" includes organized forces of the enemy in time

of war, any hostile body that our forces may be opposing, such as a rebellious

mob or a band of renegades, and includes civilians as well as members of

military organizations. "Enemy" is not restricted to the enemy

government or its armed forces. All the citizens of one belligerent are enemies

of the government and all the citizens of the other. 

#### (c) Before the enemy.

Whether a person is "before the enemy" is a question

of tactical relation, not distance. For example, a member of an antiaircraft

gun crew charged with opposing anticipated attack from the air, or a member

of a unit about to move into combat may be before the enemy although miles

from the enemy lines. On the other hand, an organization some distance from

the front or immediate area of combat which is not a part of a tactical

operation then going on or in immediate prospect is not "before or

in the presence of the enemy" within the meaning of this article.

### (2) Shamefully abandoning, surrendering, or delivering up of command.

#### (a) Scope.

This provision concerns primarily commanders chargeable with responsibility

for defending a command, unit, place, ship or military property. Abandonment

by a subordinate would ordinarily be charged as running away. 

#### (b) Shameful.

Surrender or abandonment without justification is shameful within

the meaning of this article. 

#### (c) Surrender; deliver up.

"Surrender" and "deliver up" are synonymous

 for the purposes of this article. 

#### (d) Justification.

Surrender or abandonment of a command, unit, place, ship, or military

 property by a person charged with its can be justified only by the utmost

necessity or extremity. 

### (3) Endangering safety of a command, unit, place, ship, or military property.

#### (a) Neglect.

"Neglect" is the absence of conduct which would have

been taken by a reasonably careful person in the same or similar circumstances.

#### (b) Intentional misconduct.

"Intentional misconduct" does not include a mere error

in judgment. 

### (4) Casting away arms or ammunition.

Self-explanatory. 

### (5) Cowardly conduct.

#### (a) Cowardice.

"Cowardice" is misbehavior motivated by fear. 

#### (b) Fear.

Fear is a natural feeling of apprehension when going into battle.

The mere display of apprehension does not constitute this offense. 

#### (c) Nature of offense.

Refusal or abandonment of a performance of duty before or in the

 presence of the enemy as a result of fear constitutes this offense. 

#### (d) Defense.

Genuine and extreme illness, not generated by cowardice, is a defense.

### (6) Quitting place of duty to plunder or pillage.

#### (a) Place of duty.

"Place of duty" includes any place of duty, whether

 permanent or temporary, fixed or mobile. 

#### (b) Plunder or pillage.

"Plunder or pillage" means to seize or appropriate public

 or private property unlawfully. 

#### (c) Nature of offense.

The essence of this offense is quitting the place of duty with intent

 to plunder or pillage. Merely quitting with that purpose is sufficient,

even if the intended misconduct is not done. 

### (7) Causing false alarms.

This provision covers spreading of false or disturbing rumors or

 reports, as well as the false giving of established alarm signals. 

### (8) Willfully failing to do utmost to encounter enemy.

Willfully refusing a lawful order to go on a combat patrol may

violate this provision. 

### (9) Failing to afford relief and assistance.

#### (a) All practicable relief and assistance.

"All practicable relief and assistance" means all relief

 and assistance which should be afforded within the limitations imposed upon

a person by reason of that person's own specific tasks or mission. 

#### (b) Nature of offense.

This offense is limited to a failure to afford relief and assistance

 to forces "engaged in battle." 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

All offenses under Article 99. Death or such other punishment as

a court-martial may direct. 

## f. Sample specifications.

#  Article 100-Subordinate compelling surrender

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who compels

or attempts to compel the commander of any place, vessel, aircraft, or other

military property, or of any body of members of the armed forces, to give

it up to an enemy or to abandon it, or who strikes the colors or flag to

an enemy without proper authority, shall be punished by death or such other

punishment as a court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

### (1) Compelling surrender.

(a) That a certain person was in command of a certain place, vessel,

 aircraft, or other military property or of a body of members of the armed

forces; 

(b) That the accused did an overt act which was intended to and did

 compel that commander to give it up to the enemy or abandon it; and 

(c) That the place, vessel, aircraft, or other military property or

body of members of the armed forces was actually given up to the enemy or

abandoned. 

### (2) Attempting to compel surrender.

(a) That a certain person was in command of a certain place, vessel,

 aircraft, or other military property or of a body of members of the armed

forces; 

(b) That the accused did a certain overt act; 

(c) That the act was done with the intent to compel that commander to

 give up to the enemy or abandon the place, vessel, aircraft, or other military

 property or body of members of the armed forces; 

(d) That the act amounted to more than mere preparation; and 

(e) That the act apparently tended to bring about the compelling of

 surrender or abandonment. 

### (3) Striking the colors or flag.

(a) That there was an offer of surrender to an enemy; 

(b) That this offer was made by striking the colors or flag to the enemy

 or in some other manner; 

(c) That the accused made or was responsible for the offer; and 

(d) That the accused did not have proper authority to make the offer.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Compelling surrender.

#### (a) Nature of offense.

The offenses under this article are similar to mutiny or attempted

 mutiny designed to bring about surrender or abandonment. Unlike some cases

of mutiny, however, concert of action is not an essential element of the

offenses under this article. The offense is not complete until the place,

military property, or command is actually abandoned or given up to the enemy.

#### (b) Surrender.

"Surrender" and "to give it up to an enemy"

 are synonymous. 

#### (c) Acts required.

The surrender or abandonment must be compelled or attempted to be

 compelled by acts rather than words. 

### (2) Attempting to compel surrender.

The offense of attempting to compel a surrender or abandonment does

 not require actual abandonment or surrender, but there must be some act

done with this purpose in view, even if it does not accomplish the purpose.

### (3) Striking the colors or flag.

#### (a) In general.

To "strike the colors or flag" is to haul down the colors

 or flag in the face of the enemy or to make any other offer of surrender.

It is traditional wording for an act of surrender. 

#### (b) Nature of offense.

The offense is committed when one assumes the authority to surrender

 a military force or position when not authorized to do so either by competent

authority or by the necessities of battle. If continued battle has become

fruitless and it is impossible to communicate with higher authority, those

facts will constitute proper authority to surrender. The offense may be committed

 whenever there is sufficient contact with the enemy to give the opportunity

of making an offer of surrender and it is not necessary that an engagement

with the enemy be in progress. It is unnecessary to prove that the offer

was received by the enemy or that it was rejected or accepted. The sending

of an emissary charged with making the offer or surrender is an act sufficient

to prove the offer, even though the emissary does not reach the enemy. 

### (4) Enemy.

For a discussion of "enemy," _see_ paragraph

23c(1)(_b_). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

#  Article 101-Improper use of countersign

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who in time

of war discloses the parole or countersign to any person not entitled to

receive it or who gives to another who is entitled to receive and use the

parole or countersign a different parole or countersign from that which,

to his knowledge, he was authorized and required to give, shall be punished

by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Disclosing the parole or countersign to one not entitled to receive

 it.

(a) That, in time of war, the accused disclosed the parole or countersign

 to a person, identified or unidentified; and 

(b) That this person was not entitled to receive it. 

### (2) Giving a parole or countersign different from that authorized.

(a) That, in time of war, the accused knew that the accused was authorized

 and required to give a certain parole or countersign; and 

(b) That the accused gave to a person entitled to receive and use this

 parole or countersign a different parole or countersign from that which

the accused was authorized and required to give. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Countersign.

A countersign is a word, signal, or procedure given from the principal

headquarters of a command to aid guards and sentinels in their scrutiny of

persons who apply to pass the lines. It consists of a secret challenge and

a password, signal, or procedure. 

### (2) Parole.

A parole is a word used as a check on the countersign; it is given

 only to those who are entitled to inspect guards and to commanders of guards.

### (3) Who may receive countersign.

The class of persons entitled to receive the countersign or parole

 will expand and contract under the varying circumstances of war. Who these

persons are will be determined largely, in any particular case, by the general

or special orders under which the accused was acting. Before disclosing such

a word, a person subject to military law must determine at that person's

peril that the recipient is a person authorized to receive it. 

### (4) Intent, motive, negligence, mistake, ignorance not defense.

The accused's intent or motive in disclosing the countersign or

 parole is immaterial to the issue of guilt, as is the fact that the disclosure

was negligent or inadvertent. It is no defense that the accused did not

know that the person to whom the countersign or parole was given was not

entitled to receive it. 

### (5) How accused received countersign or parole.

It is immaterial whether the accused had received the countersign

or parole in the regular course of duty or whether it was obtained in some

other way. 

### (6) In time of war.

 _See_ R.C.M. 103(19). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct. 

## f. Sample specifications.

### (1) Disclosing the parole or countersign to one not entitled to receive

#  Article 102-Forcing a safeguard

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who forces

a safeguard shall suffer death or such other punishment as a court-martial

may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) that a safeguard had been issued or posted for the protection of

a certain person or persons, place, or property; 

(2) That the accused knew or should have known of the safeguard; and

(3) That the accused forced the safeguard. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Safeguard.

A safeguard is a detachment, guard, or detail posted by a commander

 for the protection of persons, places, or property of the enemy, or of a

neutral affected by the relationship of belligerent forces in their prosecution

of war or during circumstances amounting to a state of belligerency. The

term also includes a written order left by a commander with an enemy subject

or posted upon enemy property for the protection of that person or property.

A safeguard is not a device adopted by a belligerent to protect its own property

 or nationals or to ensure order within its own forces, even if those forces

 are in a theater of combat operations, and the posting of guards or of off-limits

signs does not establish a safeguard unless a commander takes those actions

to protect enemy or neutral persons or property. The effect of a safeguard

is to pledge the honor of the nation that the person or property shall be

respected by the national armed forces. 

### (2) Forcing a safeguard.

"Forcing a safeguard" means to perform an act or acts

in violation of the protection of the safeguard. 

### (3) Nature of offense.

Any trespass on the protection of the safeguard will constitute

an offense under this article, whether the safeguard was imposed in time

of war or in circumstances amounting to a state of belligerency short of

a formal state of war. 

### (4) Knowledge.

Actual knowledge of the safeguard is not required. It is sufficient

 if an accused should have known of the existence of the safeguard. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct. 

## f. Sample specification.

In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), did, (at/on board-location), on or about  20  , force a safeguard, (known by him/her to have been placed

over the premises occupied by  at  by

(overwhelming the guard posted for the protection of the same)

()) ().

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Failing to secure public property taken from the enemy.

Unlike the remaining offenses under this article, failing to secure

 public property taken from the enemy involves only public property. Immediately

upon its capture from the enemy public property becomes the property of

the United States. Neither the person who takes it nor any other person has

any private right in this property.

#### (a) Reports.

Reports of receipt of captured or abandoned property are to be made

"Proper authority" is any authority competent to order

 disposition of the property in question. 

### (3) Dealing in captured or abandoned property.

"Disposed of" includes destruction or abandonment.

### (4) Looting or pillaging.

"Looting or pillaging" means unlawfully seizing or

appropriating property which is located in enemy or occupied territory.

#  Article 105-Misconduct as a prisoner

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, while

in the hands of the enemy in time of war-**

(1) **for the purpose of securing favorable treatment by his captors

acts without proper authority in a manner contrary to law, custom, or regulation,

to the detriment of others of whatever nationality held by the enemy as

civilian or military prisoners; or**

(2) **while in a position of authority over such persons maltreats them

 without justifiable cause; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Acting without authority to the detriment of another for the purpose

of securing favorable treatment.

(a) That without proper authority the accused acted in a manner contrary

 to law, custom, or regulation; 

(b) That the act was committed while the accused was in the hands of

the enemy in time of war; 

(c) That the act was done for the purpose of securing favorable treatment

 of the accused by the captors; and 

(d) That other prisoners held by the enemy, either military or civilian,

 suffered some detriment because of the accused's act. 

### (2) Maltreating prisoners while in a position of authority.

(a) That the accused maltreated a prisoner held by the enemy; 

(b) That the act occurred while the accused was in the hands of the

Unauthorized conduct by a prisoner of war must be intended to result

reduced rations, physical punishment, or other harm. Examples of this conduct

include reporting plans of escape being prepared by others or reporting secret

food caches, equipment, or arms. The conduct of the prisoner must be contrary

to law, custom, or regulation.

Escape from the enemy is authorized by custom. An escape or escape

 attempt which results in closer confinement or other measures against fellow

prisoners still in the hands of the enemy is not an offense under this article.

### (4) Maltreating prisoners while in a position of authority.

#  Article 106-Spies

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person who in time of war is found lurking

as a spy or acting as a spy in or about any place, vessel, or aircraft,

within the control or jurisdiction of any of the armed forces, or in or

about any shipyard, any manufacturing or industrial plant, or any other place

or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution of the war by the

United States, or elsewhere, shall be tried by a general court-martial or

by a military commission and on conviction shall be punished by death.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused was found in, about, or in and about a certain

 place, vessel, or aircraft within the control or jurisdiction of an armed

force of the United States, or a shipyard, manufacturing or industrial plant,

or other place or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution

of the war by the United States, or elsewhere; 

(2) That the accused was lurking, acting clandestinely or under false

 pretenses; 

(3) That the accused was collecting or attempting to collect certain

 information; 

(4) That the accused did so with the intent to convey this information

to the enemy; and 

(5) That this was done in time of war. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In time of war.

 _See_ R.C.M. 103(19). 

### (2) Enemy.

For a discussion of "enemy," _see_ paragraph

23c(1)(b). 

### (3) Scope of offense.

The words "any person" bring within the jurisdiction

of general courts-martial and military commissions all persons of whatever

nationality or status who commit spying. 

### (4) Nature of offense.

A person can be a spy only when, acting clandestinely or under false

 pretenses, that person obtains or seeks to obtain information with the intent

to convey it to a hostile party. It is not essential that the accused obtain

the information sought or that it be communicated. The offense is complete

with lurking or acting clandestinely or under false pretenses with intent

to accomplish these objects. 

### (5) Intent.

It is necessary to prove an intent to convey information to the

 enemy. This intent may be inferred from evidence of a deceptive insinuation

of the accused among our forces, but evidence that the person had come within

the lines for a comparatively innocent purpose, as to visit family or to

reach friendly lines by assuming a disguise, is admissible to rebut this

inference. 

### (6) Persons not included under "spying."

(a) Members of a military organization not wearing a disguise, dispatch

 drivers, whether members of a military organization or civilians, and persons

in ships or aircraft who carry out their missions openly and who have penetrated

enemy lines are not spies because, while they may have resorted to concealment,

they have not acted under false pretenses. 

(b) A spy who, after rejoining the armed forces to which the spy belongs,

 is later captured by the enemy incurs no responsibility for previous acts

of espionage. 

(c) A person living in occupied territory who, without lurking, or acting

 clandestinely or under false pretenses, merely reports what is seen or heard

 through agents to the enemy may be charged under Article 104 with giving

intelligence to or communicating with the enemy, but may not be charged

under this article as being a spy. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Mandatory punishment.

Death.

#  Article 107-False official statements

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, with

intent to deceive, signs any false record, return, regulation, order, or

other official document, knowing it to be false, or makes any other false

official statement knowing it to be false, shall be punished as a court-martial

may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused signed a certain official document or made a certain

 official statement; 

(2) That the document or statement was false in certain particulars;

(3) That the accused knew it to be false at the time of signing it or

 making it; and 

(4) That the false document or statement was made with the intent to

 deceive. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Official documents and statements.

Official documents and official statements include all documents

and statements made in the line of duty. 

### (2) Status of victim of the deception.

The rank of any person intended to be deceived is immaterial if

that person was authorized in the execution of a particular duty to require

or receive the statement or document from the accused. The government may

be the victim of this offense. 

### (3) Intent to deceive.

The false representation must be made with the intent to deceive.

It is not necessary that the false statement be material to the issue inquiry.

If, however, the falsity is in respect to a material matter, it may be considered

as some evidence of the intent to deceive, while immateriality may tend to

show an absence of this intent. 

### (4) Material gain.

The expectation of material gain is not an element of this offense.

 Such expectation or lack of it, however, is circumstantial evidence bearing

on the element of intent to deceive. 

### (5) Knowledge that the document or statement was false.

The false representation must be one which the accused actually

knew was false. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence.

An honest, although erroneous, belief that a statement made is true, is

a defense. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years. 

## f. Sample specification.

#  Article 108-Military property of the United States-sale,

loss, damage, destruction, or wrongful disposition

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, without

proper authority-**

(1) **sells or otherwise disposes of;**

(2) **willfully or through neglect damages, destroys, or loses; or**

(3) **willfully or through neglect suffers to be lost, damaged, destroyed,

 sold, or wrongfully disposed of, any military property of the United States,

shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Selling or otherwise disposing of military property.

(a) That the accused sold or otherwise disposed of certain property

 (which was a firearm or explosive); 

(b) That the sale or disposition was without proper authority; 

(c) That the property was military property of the United States; and

(d) That the property was of a certain value. 

### (2) Damaging, destroying, or losing military property.

(a) That the accused, without proper authority, damaged or destroyed

 certain property in a certain way, or lost certain property; 

(b) That the property was military property of the United States; 

(c) That the damage, destruction, or loss was willfully caused by the

 accused or was the result of neglect by the accused; and 

(d) That the property was of a certain value or the damage was of a

 certain amount. 

### (3) Suffering military property to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or

(a) That certain property (which was a firearm or explosive) was lost,

 damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of; 

(b) That the property was military property of the United States; 

(c) That the loss, damage, destruction, sale, or wrongful disposition

was suffered by the accused, without proper authority, through a certain

omission of duty by the accused; 

(d) That the omission was willful or negligent; and 

(e) That the property was of a certain value or the damage was of a

 certain amount. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Military property.

Military property is all property, real or personal, owned, held, or used by one of the armed forces of the United States. Military property is a term of art, and should not be confused with government property. The terms are not interchangeable. While all military property is government property, not all government property is military property. An item of government property is not military property unless the item in question meets the definition provided above. It is immaterial whether the property sold, disposed, destroyed, lost, or damaged had been issued to the accused, to someone else, or even issued at all. If it is proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence that items of individual issue were issued to the accused, it may be inferred, depending on all the evidence, that the damage, destruction, or loss proved was due to the neglect of the accused. Retail merchandise of service exchange stores is not military property under this article.

### (2) Suffering military property to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold,

or wrongfully disposed of.

"To suffer" means to allow or permit. The willful or

 negligent sufferance specified by this article includes: deliberate violation

or intentional disregard of some specific law, regulation, or order; reckless

or unwarranted personal use of the property; causing or allowing it to remain

exposed to the weather, insecurely housed, or not guarded; permitting it

to be consumed, wasted, or injured by other persons; or loaning it to a

person, known to be irresponsible, by whom it is damaged. 

### (3) Value and damage.

In the case of loss, destruction, sale, or wrongful disposition,

the value of the property controls the maximum punishment which may be adjudged.

In the case of damage, the amount of damage controls. As a general rule,

the amount of damage is the estimated or actual cost of repair by the government

agency normally employed in such work, or the cost of replacement, as shown

by government price lists or otherwise, whichever is less. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Selling or otherwise disposing of military property.

#### (a) Of a value of $500.00 or less.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

#### (b) Of a value of more than $500.00 or any firearm or explosive.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

### (2) Through neglect damaging, destroying, or losing, or through neglect

 suffering to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of,

military property.

#### (a) Of a value or damage of $500.00 or less.

Confinement for 6 months, and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month

 for 6 months. 

#### (b) Of a value or damage of more than $500.00.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

### (3) Willfully damaging, destroying, or losing, or willfully suffering to

be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of, military property.

#### (a) Of a value or damage of $500.00 or less.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

#### (b) Of a value or damage of more than $500.00, or of any firearm or explosive.

#  Article 109-Property other than military property of the United

States-waste, spoilage, or destruction

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who willfully

or recklessly wastes, spoils, or otherwise willfully and wrongfully destroys

or damages any property other than military property of the United States

shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

### (1) Wasting or spoiling of non-military property.

(a) That the accused willfully or recklessly wasted or spoiled certain

real property in a certain manner; 

(b) That the property was that of another person; and 

(c) That the property was of a certain value. 

### (2) Destroying or damaging non-military property.

(a) That the accused willfully and wrongfully destroyed or damaged certain

 personal property in a certain manner; 

(b) That the property was that of another person; and 

(c) That the property was of a certain value or the damage was of a

 certain amount. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Wasting or spoiling non-military property.

This portion of Article 109 proscribes willful or reckless waste

or spoliation of the real property of another. The terms "wastes"

and "spoils" as used in this article refer to such wrongful

acts of voluntary destruction of or permanent damage to real property as

burning down buildings, burning piers, tearing down fences, or cutting down

trees. This destruction in punishable whether done willfully, that is intentionally,

or recklessly, that is through a culpable disregard of the foreseeable consequences

 of some voluntary act. 

### (2) Destroying or damaging non-military property.

This portion of Article 109 proscribes the willful and wrongful

 destruction or damage of the personal property of another. To be destroyed,

the property need not be completely demolished or annihilated, but must

be sufficiently injured to be useless for its intended purpose. Damage consists

of any physical injury to the property. To constitute an offense under this

section, the destruction or damage of the property must have been willful

and wrongful. As used in this section "willfully" means intentionally

and "wrongfully" means contrary to law, regulation, lawful order,

or custom. Willfulness may be proved by circumstantial evidence, such as

the manner in which the acts were done. 

### (3) Value and damage.

In the case of destruction, the value of the property destroyed

 controls the maximum punishment which may be adjudged. In the case of damage,

the amount of the damage controls. As a general rule, the amount of damage

is the estimated or actual cost of repair by artisans employed in this work

who are available to the community wherein the owner resides, or the replacement

cost, whichever is less. _See also_ paragraph 46c(1)(g). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Wasting, spoiling, destroying, or damaging any property other than

 military property of the United States of a value or damage. 

### (1) Of $500.00 or less.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

### (2) Of more than $500.00.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years.

#  Article 110-Improper hazarding of vessel

## a. Text of statute.

(a) **Any person subject to this chapter who willfully and wrongfully

 hazards or suffers to be hazarded any vessel of the armed forces shall suffer

 death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.**

(b) **Any person subject to this chapter who negligently hazards or

suffers to be hazarded any vessel of the armed forces shall be punished as

a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That a vessel of the armed forces was hazarded in a certain manner;

and 

(2) That the accused by certain acts or omissions, willfully and wrongfully,

 or negligently, caused or suffered the vessel to be hazarded. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Hazard.

"Hazard" means to put in danger of loss or injury. Actual

 damage to, or loss of, a vessel of the armed forces by collision, stranding,

running upon a shoal or a rock, or by any other cause, is conclusive evidence

that the vessel was hazarded but not of the fact of culpability on the part

of any particular person. "Stranded" means run aground so that

the vessel is fast for a time. If the vessel "touches and goes,"

she is not stranded; if she "touches and sticks," she is. A shoal

is a sand, mud, or gravel bank or bar that makes the water shallow. 

### (2) Willfully and wrongfully.

As used in this article, "willfully" means intentionally

 and "wrongfully" means contrary to law, regulation, lawful order,

or custom. 

### (3) Negligence.

"Negligence" as used in this article means the failure

to exercise the care, prudence, or attention to duties, which the interests

of the government require a prudent and reasonable person to exercise under

the circumstances. This negligence may consist of the omission to do something

the prudent and reasonable person would have done, or the doing of something

which such a person would not have done under the circumstances. No person

is relieved of culpability who fails to perform such duties as are imposed

by the general responsibilities of that person's grade or rank, or by the

customs of the service for the safety and protection of vessels of the armed

forces, simply because these duties are not specifically enumerated in a

 regulation or order. However, a mere error in judgment that a reasonably

able person might have committed under the same circumstances does not constitute

an offense under this article. 

### (4) Suffer.

"To suffer" means to allow or permit. A ship is willfully

 suffered to be hazarded by one who, although not in direct control of the

vessel, knows a danger to be imminent but takes no steps to prevent it,

as by a plotting officer of a ship under way who fails to report to the officer

of the deck a radar target which is observed to be on a collision course

with, and dangerously close to, the ship. A suffering through neglect implies

an omission to take such measures as were appropriate under the circumstances

to prevent a foreseeable danger. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Hazarding or suffering to be hazarded any vessel of the armed forces:

### (1) Willfully and wrongfully.

Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct. 

### (2) Negligently.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years. 

## f. Sample specifications.

### (1) Hazarding or suffering to be hazarded any vessel, willfully and wrongfully.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), did, on   20 , while

serving as  aboard the  in

the vicinity of  , willfully and wrongfully (hazard

 the said vessel) (suffer the said vessel to be hazarded) by (causing the

said vessel to collide with  ) (allowing the said

vessel to run aground) (  ). 

### (2) Hazarding of vessel, negligently.

#### (a) Example 1.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), on   20 , while serving

in command of the  , making entrance to (Boston Harbor),

did negligently hazard the said vessel by failing and neglecting to maintain

or cause to be maintained an accurate running plot of the true position

of said vessel while making said approach, as a result of which neglect the

 said  , at or about  , hours

on the day aforesaid, became stranded in the vicinity of (Channel Buoy Number

Three). 

#### (b) Example 2.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), on   20 , while serving

as navigator of the  , cruising on special service

in the  Ocean off the coast of  ,

notwithstanding the fact that at about midnight,  20

  , the northeast point of 

Island bore abeam and was about six miles distant, the said ship being then

under way and making a speed of about ten knots, and well knowing the position

of the said ship at the time stated, and that the charts of the locality

were unreliable and the currents thereabouts uncertain, did then and there

negligently hazard the said vessel by failing and neglecting to exercise

proper care and attention in navigating said ship while approaching  Island, in that he/she neglected and failed to lay a course

that would carry said ship clear of the last aforesaid island, and to change

the course in due time to avoid disaster; and the said ship, as a result

of said negligence on the part of said  , ran upon

a rock off the southwest coast of  Island, at about

 hours,  ,  20 ,

in consequence of which the said  was lost. 

#### (c) Example 3.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), on   20 , while serving

as navigator of the  and well knowing that at about

sunset of said day the said ship had nearly run her estimated distance from

the  position, obtained and plotted by him/her, to

the position of  , and well knowing the difficulty

of sighting  , from a safe distance after sunset,

did then and there negligently hazard the said vessel by failing and neglecting

to advise his/her commanding officer to lay a safe course for said ship to

the northward before continuing on a westerly course, as it was the duty

of said  to do; in consequence of which the said

ship was, at about  hours on the day above mentioned,

run upon  bank in the  Sea,

about latitude  degrees,  minutes,

 north, and longitude  degrees,  minutes,

west, and seriously injured. 

### (3) Suffering a vessel to be hazarded, negligently.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), while serving as combat intelligence center officer on board the  , making passage from Boston to Philadelphia, and having,

between  and  hours on

 ,  20 , been duly informed of decreasing

radar ranges and constant radar bearing indicating that the said   was upon a collision course approaching a radar target, did then

and there negligently suffer the said vessel to be hazarded by failing and

neglecting to report said collision course with said radar target to the

officer of the deck, as it was his/her duty to do, and he/she, the said , through negligence, did cause the said   to collide with the  at or about  hours on said date, with resultant damage to both vessels.

#  Article 111-Drunken or reckless operation of vehicle, aircraft,

or vessel

## a. Text of statute.

**(a) Any person subject to this chapter who-**

(1) **operates or physically controls any vehicle, aircraft, or vessel in a reckless or wanton manner or while impaired by a substance described in section 912a(b) of this title (Article 112a(b)); or**

(2) **operates or is in actual physical control of any vehicle, aircraft, or vessel while drunk or when the alcohol concentration in the person's blood or breath is equal to or exceeds the applicable limit under subsection (b), shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

**(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a), the applicable limit on the alcohol concentration in a person's blood or breath is as follows:**

 **(A) In the case of the operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel in the United States, such limit is the lesser of-**

  **(i) the blood alcohol content limit under the law of the State in which the conduct occurred, except as may be provided under paragraph (2) for conduct on a military installation that is in more than one State; or**

  **(ii) the blood alcohol content limit specified in paragraph (3).**

 **(B) In the case of the operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel outside the United States, the applicable blood alcohol content limit is the blood alcohol content limit specified in paragraph (3) or such lower limit as the Secretary of Defense may by regulation prescribe.**

**(2) In the case of a military installation that is in more than one State, if those States have different blood alcohol content limits under their respective State laws, the Secretary may select one such blood alcohol content limit to apply uniformly on that installation.**

**(3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the blood alcohol content limit with respect to alcohol concentration in a person's blood is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood and with respect to alcohol concentration in a person's breath is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, as shown by chemical analysis.**

**(4) In this subsection:**

 **(A) The term "blood alcohol content limit" means the amount of alcohol concentration in a person's blood or breath at which operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel is prohibited.**

 **(B) The term "United States" includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa and the term "State" includes each of those jurisdictions.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused was operating or in physical control of a vehicle,

aircraft, or vessel; and

(2) That while operating or in physical control of a vehicle, aircraft,

or vessel, the accused:

(a) did so in a wanton or reckless manner, or

(b) was drunk or impaired, or

(c) the alcohol concentration in the accused's blood or breath equaled or exceeded the applicable limit under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 35a. --LSQP--NOTE: If injury resulted add the following element--RSQP--

(3) That the accused thereby caused the vehicle, aircraft, or vessel

to injure a person. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Vehicle.

_See_ 1 U.S.C. --SECT-- 4. 

### (2) Vessel.

_See._ 1 U.S.C. --SECT-- 3. 

### (3) Aircraft.

Any contrivance used or designed for transportation in the air.

### (4) Operates.

Operating a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel includes not only driving

 or guiding a vehicle, aircraft or vessel while it is in motion, either in

person or through the agency of another, but also setting of its motive

power in action or the manipulation of its controls so as to cause the particular

vehicle, aircraft or vessel to move. 

### (5) Physical control and actual physical control.

These terms as used in the statute are synonymous. They describe

the present capability and power to dominate, direct or regulate the vehicle,

vessel, or aircraft, either in person or through the agency of another,

regardless of whether such vehicle, aircraft, or vessel is operated. For

example, the intoxicated person seated behind the steering wheel of a vehicle

with the keys of the vehicle in or near the ignition but with the engine

not turned on could be deemed in actual physical control of that vehicle.

However, the person asleep in the back seat with the keys in his or her pocket

would not be deemed in actual physical control. Physical control necessarily

encompasses operation. 

### (6) Drunk or impaired.

"Drunk" and "impaired" mean any intoxication

 which is sufficient to impair the rational and full exercise of the mental

or physical faculties. The term drunk is used in relation to intoxication

by alcohol. The term impaired is used in relation to intoxication by a substance

described in Article 112(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice. 

### (7) Reckless.

The operation or physical control of a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft

 is "reckless" when it exhibits a culpable disregard of foreseeable

consequences to others from the act or omission involved. Recklessness is

not determined solely by reason of the happening of an injury, or the invasion

of the rights of another, nor by proof alone of excessive speed or erratic

operation, but all these factors may be admissible and relevant as bearing

upon the ultimate question: whether, under all the circumstances, the accused's

manner of operation or physical control of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft

was of that heedless nature which made it actually or imminently dangerous

to the occupants, or to the rights or safety of others. It is operating

or physically controlling a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft with such a high

degree of negligence that if death were caused, the accused would have committed

involuntary manslaughter, at least. The nature of the conditions in which

the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is operated or controlled, the time of day

or night, the proximity and number of other vehicles, vessels, or aircraft

and the condition of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, are often matters

of importance in the proof of an offense charged under this article and,

 where they are of importance, may properly be alleged. 

### (8) Wanton.

"Wanton" includes "reckless," but in describing

the operation or physical control of a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft "wanton"

may, in a proper case, connote willfulness, or a disregard of probable consequences,

and thus describe a more aggravated offense. 

### (9) Causation.

The accused's drunken or reckless driving must be a proximate cause

 of injury for the accused to be guilty of drunken or reckless driving resulting

in personal injury. To be proximate, the accused's actions need not be

the sole cause of the injury, nor must they be the immediate cause of the

injury, that is, the latest in time and space preceding the injury. A contributing

cause is deemed proximate only if it plays a material role in the victim's

injury. 

### (10) Separate offenses.

While the same course of conduct may constitute violations of both

 subsections (1) and (2) of the Article, e.g., both drunken and reckless

operation or physical control, this article proscribes the conduct described

in both subsections as separate offenses, which may be charged separately.

 However, as recklessness is a relative matter, evidence of all the surrounding

circumstances that made the operation dangerous, whether alleged or not,

may be admissible. Thus, on a charge of reckless driving, for example, evidence

of drunkenness might be admissible as establishing one aspect of the recklessness,

and evidence that the vehicle exceeded a safe speed, at a relevant prior

point and time, might be admissible as corroborating other evidence of the

 specific recklessness charged. Similarly, on a charge of drunken driving,

 relevant evidence of recklessness might have probative value as corroborating

other proof of drunkenness. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Resulting in personal injury.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 18 months. 

### (2) No personal injury involved.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 6 months.

#  Article 112-Drunk on duty

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter other than

sentinel or look-out, who is found drunk on duty, shall be punished as a

court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused was on a certain duty; and 

(2) That the accused was found drunk while on this duty. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Drunk.

_See_ paragraph 35c(6). 

### (2) Duty.

"Duty" as used in this article means military duty.

Every duty which an officer or enlisted person may legally be required by

superior authority to execute is necessarily a military duty. Within the

meaning of this article, when in the actual exercise of command, the commander

of a post, or of a command, or of a detachment in the field is constantly

on duty, as is the commanding officer on board a ship. In the case of other

officers or enlisted persons, "on duty" relates to duties or

routine or detail, in garrison, at a station, or in the field, and does not

relate to those periods when, no duty being required of them by orders or

regulations, officers and enlisted persons occupy the status of leisure

known as "off duty" or "on liberty." In a region of

 active hostilities, the circumstances are often such that all members of

a command may properly be considered as being continuously on duty within

 the meaning of this article. So also, an officer of the day and members of

the guard, or of the watch, are on duty during their entire tour within

the meaning of this article. 

### (3) Nature of offense.

It is necessary that the accused be found drunk while actually on

the duty alleged, and the fact the accused became drunk before going on

duty, although material in extenuation, does not affect the question of

guilt. If, however, the accused does not undertake the responsibility or

enter upon the duty at all, the accused's conduct does not fall within the

terms of this article, nor does that of a person who absents himself or

herself from duty and is found drunk while so absent. Included within the

article is drunkenness while on duty of an anticipatory nature such as that

of an aircraft crew ordered to stand by for flight duty, or of an enlisted

person ordered to stand by for guard duty. 

### (4) Defenses.

If the accused is known by superior authorities to be drunk at the

 time a duty is assigned, and the accused is thereafter allowed to assume

that duty anyway, or if the drunkenness results from an accidental over

dosage administered for medicinal purposes, the accused will have a defense

to this offense. _But see_ paragraph 76 (incapacitation for

duty). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 9 months. 

## f. Sample specification.

and 

(b) That the possession by the accused was wrongful. 

### (2) Wrongful use of controlled substance.

(a) That the accused used a controlled substance; and

(a) That the accused distributed a certain amount of a controlled substance;

and 

(b) That the distribution by the accused was wrongful. 

### (4) Wrongful introduction of a controlled substance.

(a) That the accused introduced onto a vessel, aircraft, vehicle, or

forces a certain amount of a controlled substance; and 

(b) That the introduction was wrongful. 

### (5) Wrongful manufacture of a controlled substance.

(b) That the manufacture was wrongful. 

### (6) Wrongful possession, manufacture, or introduction of a controlled

substance with intent to distribute.

(a) That the accused (possessed) (manufactured) (introduced) a certain

 amount of a controlled substance; 

(b) That the (possession) (manufacture) (introduction) was wrongful;

### (7) Wrongful importation or exportation of a controlled substance.

(a) That the accused (imported into the customs territory of) (exported

 from) the United States a certain amount of a controlled substance; and

(b) That the (importation) (exportation) was wrongful.

--LSQP--Note: When any of the aggravating circumstances listed in

 subparagraph e is alleged, it must be listed as an element.--RSQP--

 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Controlled substance.

"Controlled substance" means amphetamine, cocaine,

heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide, marijuana, methamphetamine, opium, phencyclidine,

and barbituric acid, including phenobarbital and secobarbital. "Controlled

substance" also means any substance which is included in Schedules

I through V established by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C.

812). 

### (2) Possess.

"Possess" means to exercise control of something. Possession

may be direct physical custody like holding an item in one's hand, or it

may be constructive, as in the case of a person who hides an item in a locker

or car to which that person may return to retrieve it. Possession must be

knowing and conscious. Possession inherently includes the power or authority

to preclude control by others. It is possible, however, for more than one

 person to possess an item simultaneously, as when several people share control

of an item. An accused may not be convicted of possession of a controlled

substance if the accused did not know that the substance was present under

the accused's control. Awareness of the presence of a controlled substance

may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. 

### (3) Distribute.

"Distribute" means to deliver to the possession of

another. "Deliver" means the actual, constructive, or attempted

transfer of an item, whether or not there exists an agency relationship.

### (4) Manufacture.

"Manufacture" means the production, preparation, propagation,

compounding, or processing of a drug or other substance, either directly

or indirectly or by extraction from substances of natural origin, or independently

by means of chemical synthesis or by a combination of extraction and chemical

synthesis, and includes any packaging or repackaging of such substance or

labeling or relabeling of its container. "Production," as used

in this subparagraph, includes the planting, cultivating, growing, or harvesting

 of a drug or other substance. 

### (5) Wrongfulness.

To be punishable under Article 112a, possession, use, distribution,

 introduction, or manufacture of a controlled substance must be wrongful.

Possession, use, distribution, introduction, or manufacture of a controlled

substance is wrongful if it is without legal justification or authorization.

Possession, distribution, introduction, or manufacture of a controlled substance

is not wrongful if such act or acts are: (A) done pursuant to legitimate

law enforcement activities (for example, an informant who receives drugs

as part of an undercover operation is not in wrongful possession); (B) done

by authorized personnel in the performance of medical duties; or (C) without

knowledge of the contraband nature of the substance (for example, a person

who possesses cocaine, but actually believes it to be sugar, is not guilty

of wrongful possession of cocaine). Possession, use, distribution, introduction,

or manufacture of a controlled substance may be inferred to be wrongful

in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The burden of going forward with

 evidence with respect to any such exception in any court-martial or other

proceeding under the code shall be upon the person claiming its benefit.

If such an issue is raised by the evidence presented, then the burden of

proof is upon the United States to establish that the use, possession, distribution,

manufacture, or introduction was wrongful. 

### (6) Intent to distribute.

Intent to distribute may be inferred from circumstantial evidence.

 Examples of evidence which may tend to support an inference of intent to

distribute are: possession of a quantity of substance in excess of that

which one would be likely to have for personal use; market value of the substance;

the manner in which the substance is packaged; and that the accused is not

a user of the substance. On the other hand, evidence that the accused is

addicted to or is a heavy user of the substance may tend to negate an inference

of intent to distribute. 

### (7) Certain amount.

When a specific amount of a controlled substance is believed to

have been possessed, distributed, introduced, or manufactured by an accused,

the specific amount should ordinarily be alleged in the specification. It

is not necessary to allege a specific amount, however, and a specification

 is sufficient if it alleges that an accused possessed, distributed, introduced,

or manufactured "some," "traces of," or "an

unknown quantity of" a controlled substance. 

### (8) Missile launch facility.

A "missile launch facility" includes the place from

which missiles are fired and launch control facilities from which the launch

of a missile is initiated or controlled after launch. 

### (9) Customs territory of the United States.

"Customs territory of the United States" includes only

 the States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 

### (10) Use.

"Use" means to inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise

 introduce into the human body, any controlled substance. Knowledge of the

presence of the controlled substance is a required component of use. Knowledge

of the presence of the controlled substance may be inferred from the presence

of the controlled substance in the accused's body or from other circumstantial

evidence. This permissive inference may be legally sufficient to satisfy

the government's burden of proof as to knowledge. 

### (11) Deliberate ignorance.

An accused who consciously avoids knowledge of the presence of a

 controlled substance or the contraband nature of the substance is subject

to the same criminal liability as one who has actual knowledge. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishments.

### (1) Wrongful use, possession, manufacture, or introduction of controlled

 substance.

#### (a) Amphetamine, cocaine, heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide, marijuana

 (except possession of less than 30 grams or use of marijuana), methamphetamine,

opium, phencyclidine, secobarbital, and Schedule I, II, III controlled substances.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement 5 years. 

#### (b) Marijuana (possession of less than 30 grams or use), phenobarbital,

and Schedule IV and V controlled substances.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years. 

### (2) Wrongful distribution, possession, manufacture, or introduction of

 controlled substance with intent to distribute, or wrongful importation

or exportation of a controlled substance.

#### (a) Amphetamine, cocaine, heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide, marijuana,

 methamphetamine, opium, phencyclidine, secobarbital, and Schedule I, II,

and III controlled substances.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 15 years. 

#### (b) Phenobarbital and Schedule IV and V controlled substances.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years.

while the accused is on duty as a sentinel or lookout; on board a vessel

or aircraft used by or under the control of the armed forces; in or at a

missile launch facility used by or under the control of the armed forces;

while receiving special pay under 37 U.S.C. --SECT-- 310; in time of war;

or in a confinement facility used by or under the control of the armed forces,

the maximum period of confinement authorized for such offense shall be increased

 by 5 years.

#  Article 113-Misbehavior of sentinel or lookout

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any sentinel or look-out who is found drunk

or sleeping upon his post, or leaves it before he is regularly relieved,

shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death or

such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, but if the offense is

 committed at any other time, by such punishment other than death as a court-martial

may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused was posted or on post as a sentinel or lookout;

(2) That the accused was found drunk while on post, was found sleeping

 while on post, or left post before being regularly relieved.

--LSQP--Note: If the offense was committed in time of war or while

the accused was receiving special pay under 37 U.S.C. --SECT-- 310, add the

following element--RSQP--

(3) That the offense was committed (in time of war) (while the accused

 was receiving special pay under 37 U.S.C. --SECT-- 310). 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

This article defines three kinds of misbehavior committed by sentinels

or lookouts: being found drunk or sleeping upon post, or leaving it before

being regularly relieved. This article does not include an officer or enlisted

person of the guard, or of a ship's watch, not posted or performing the duties

of a sentinel or lookout, nor does it include a person whose duties as a

watchman or attendant do not require constant alertness. 

### (2) Post.

"Post" is the area where the sentinel or lookout is

 required to be for the performance of duties. It is not limited by an imaginary

line, but includes, according to orders or circumstances, such surrounding

 area as may be necessary for the proper performance of the duties for which

 the sentinel or lookout was posted. The offense of leaving post is not committed

when a sentinel or lookout goes an immaterial distance from the post, unless

it is such a distance that the ability to fully perform the duty for which

posted is impaired. 

### (3) On post.

A sentinel or lookout becomes "on post" after having

been given a lawful order to go "on post" as a sentinel or lookout

and being formally or informally posted. The fact that a sentinel or lookout

is not posted in the regular way is not a defense. It is sufficient, for

example, if the sentinel or lookout has taken the post in accordance with

proper instruction, whether or not formally given. A sentinel or lookout

is on post within the meaning of the article not only when at a post physically

defined, as is ordinarily the case in garrison or aboard ship, but also,

for example, when stationed in observation against the approach of an enemy,

or detailed to use any equipment designed to locate friend, foe, or possible

danger, or at a designated place to maintain internal discipline, or to guard

stores, or to guard prisoners while in confinement or at work. 

### (4) Sentinel or lookout.

A sentinel or a lookout is a person whose duties include the requirement

to maintain constant alertness, be vigilant, and remain awake, in order to

observe for the possible approach of the enemy, or to guard persons, property,

or a place and to sound the alert, if necessary. 

### (5) Drunk.

For an explanation of "drunk," _see_

paragraph 35c(3). 

### (6) Sleeping.

As used in this article, "sleeping" is that condition

of insentience which is sufficient sensibly to impair the full exercise

of the mental and physical faculties of a sentinel or lookout. It is not

necessary to show that the accused was in a wholly comatose condition. The

fact that the accused's sleeping resulted from a physical incapacity caused

by disease or accident is an affirmative defense. _See_ R.C.M.

916(i). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) In time of war.

Death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct. 

### (2) While receiving special pay under 37 U.S.C. --SECT-- 310.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

### (3) In all other places.

 Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

## f. Sample specification.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), on or about   20  (a

time of war) (at/on board-location), (while receiving special pay

under 37 U.S.C. --SECT-- 310), being (posted) (on post) as a (sentinel) (lookout)

 at (warehouse no. 7) (post no. 11) (for radar observation) (  ) (was found (drunk) (sleeping) upon his/her post) (did leave his/her

post before he/she was regularly relieved). 

#  Article 114-Dueling

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who

fights or promotes, or is concerned in or connives at fighting a duel, or

who, having knowledge of a challenge sent or about to be sent, fails to

report the fact promptly to the proper authority, shall be punished as a

court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

### (1) Dueling.

(a) That the accused fought another person with deadly weapons; 

(b) That the combat was for private reasons; and 

(c) That the combat was by prior agreement. 

### (2) Promoting a duel.

(a) That the accused promoted a duel between certain persons; and 

(b) That the accused did so in a certain manner. 

### (3) Conniving at fighting a duel.

(a) That certain persons intended to and were about to engage in a duel;

(b) That the accused had knowledge of the planned duel; and 

(c) That the accused connived at the fighting of the duel in a certain

 manner. 

### (4) Failure to report a duel.

(a) That a challenge to fight a duel had been sent or was about to be

 sent; 

(b) That the accused had knowledge of this challenge; and 

(c) That the accused failed to report this fact promptly to proper

authority. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Duel.

A duel is combat between two persons for private reasons fought

with deadly weapons by prior agreement. 

### (2) Promoting a duel.

Urging or taunting another to challenge or to accept a challenge

to duel, acting as a second or as carrier of a challenge or acceptance,

or otherwise furthering or contributing to the fighting of a duel are examples

of promoting a duel. 

### (3) Conniving at fighting a duel.

Anyone who has knowledge that steps are being taken or have been

 taken toward arranging or fighting a duel and who fails to take reasonable

preventive action thereby connives at the fighting of a duel. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

For all Article 114 offenses: dishonorable discharge, forfeiture

of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year. 

## f. Sample specifications.

### (1) Dueling.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data) (and  ), did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter

 jurisdiction data, if required), on or about  20  , fight a duel (with  ), using

as weapons therefor (pistols) (swords) (  ). 

### (2) Promoting a duel.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), having knowledge that a challenge to fight a duel (had been sent)

(was about to be sent) by  to  ,

did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required),

on or about   20  fail to

report that fact promptly to the proper authority. 

#  Article 115-Malingering

## a. Text of statute.

 

 **Any person subject to this chapter who for the

purpose of avoiding work, duty, or service- **

(1) **feigns illness, physical disablement, mental lapse or derangement;

or **

(2) **intentionally inflicts self-injury;

shall be punished as a court-martial

may direct. **

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused was assigned to, or was aware of prospective assignment

to, or availability for, the performance of work, duty, or service; 

(2) That the accused feigned illness, physical disablement, mental lapse

 or derangement, or intentionally inflicted injury upon himself or herself;

and 

(3) That the accused's purpose or intent in doing so was to avoid the

 work, duty, or service.

--LSQP--Note: If the offense was committed in time of war or in a

hostile fire pay zone, add the following element--RSQP--

(4) That the offense was committed (in time of war) (in a hostile fire

 pay zone). 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Nature of offense.

The essence of this offense is the design to avoid performance of

any work, duty, or service which may properly or normally be expected of

one in the military service. Whether to avoid all duty, or only a particular

job, it is the purpose to shirk which characterizes the offense. Hence,

the nature or permanency of a self-inflicted injury is not material on the

question of guilt, nor is the seriousness of a physical or mental disability

which is a sham. Evidence of the extent of the self-inflicted injury or

feigned disability may, however, be relevant as a factor indicating the presence

or absence of the purpose. 

### (2) How injury inflicted.

The injury may be inflicted by nonviolent as well as by violent

means and may be accomplished by any act or omission which produces, prolongs,

or aggravates any sickness or disability. Thus, voluntary starvation which

results in debility is a self-inflicted injury and when done for the purpose

of avoiding work, duty, or service constitutes a violation of this article.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Feigning illness, physical disablement, mental lapse, or derangement.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

### (2) Feigning illness, physical disablement, mental lapse, or derangement

in a hostile fire pay zone or in time of war.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 3 years. 

### (3) Intentional self-inflicted injury.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years. 

### (4) Intentional self-inflicted injury in a hostile fire pay zone or in

time of war.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

## f. Sample specification.

 data), did, (at/on board-location) (in a hostile fire pay zone) (subject-matter

 jurisdiction data, if required) (on  or about 

  20 ) (from  about   20

#  Article 116-Riot or breach of peace

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who

causes or participates in any riot or breach of the peace shall be punished

as a court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

### (1) Riot.

(a) That the accused was a member of an assembly of three or more persons;

(b) That the accused and at least two other members of this group mutually

intended to assist one another against anyone who might oppose them in doing

an act for some private purpose; 

(c) That the group or some of its members, in furtherance of such purpose,

unlawfully committed a tumultuous disturbance of the peace in a violent or

turbulent manner; and 

(d) That these acts terrorized the public in general in that they caused

 or were intended to cause public alarm or terror. 

### (2) Breach of the peace.

(a) That the accused caused or participated in a certain act of a violent

 or turbulent nature; and 

(b) That the peace was thereby unlawfully disturbed. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Riot.

"Riot" is a tumultuous disturbance of the peace by three

 or more persons assembled together in furtherance of a common purpose to

execute some enterprise of a private nature by concerted action against

anyone who might oppose them, committed in such a violent and turbulent manner

 as to cause or be calculated to cause public terror. The gravamen of the

offense of riot is terrorization of the public. It is immaterial whether

 the act intended was lawful. Furthermore, it is not necessary that the common

 purpose be determined before the assembly. It is sufficient if the assembly

begins to execute in a tumultuous manner a common purpose formed after it

assembled. 

### (2) Breach of the peace.

A "breach of the peace" is an unlawful disturbance of

the peace by an outward demonstration of a violent or turbulent nature.

The acts or conduct contemplated by this article are those which disturb

the public tranquility or impinge upon the peace and good order to which

the community is entitled. Engaging in an affray and unlawful discharge

of firearms in a public street are examples of conduct which may constitute

a breach of the peace. Loud speech and unruly conduct may also constitute

a breach of the peace by the speaker. A speaker may also by guilty of causing

a breach of the peace if the speaker uses language which can reasonably be

expected to produce a violent or turbulent response and a breach of the peace

results. The fact that the words are true or used under provocation is not

a defense, nor is tumultuous conduct excusable because incited by others.

### (3) Community and public.

"Community" and "public" include a military

 organization, post, camp, ship, aircraft, or station. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Riot.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

### (2) Breach of the peace.

Confinement for 6 months and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month

 for 6 months. 

## f. Sample specifications.

### (1) Riot.

#  Article 117-Provoking speeches or gestures

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who

uses provoking or reproachful words or gestures towards any other person

subject to this chapter shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

(1) That the accused wrongfully used words or gestures toward a certain

 person; 

(2) That the words or gestures used were provoking or reproachful; and

(3) That the person toward whom the words or gestures were used was

a person subject to the code. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

As used in this article, "provoking" and "reproachful"

describe those words or gestures which are used in the presence of the person

to whom they are directed and which a reasonable person would expect to

induce a breach of the peace under the circumstances. These words and gestures

do not include reprimands, censures, reproofs and the like which may properly

be administered in the interests of training, efficiency, or discipline

in the armed forces. 

### (2) Knowledge.

It is not necessary that the accused have knowledge that the person

 toward whom the words or gestures are directed is a person subject to the

code. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Confinement for 6 months and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month

(b) That the death resulted from the intentional act of the accused;

(c) That this act was inherently dangerous to another and showed a wanton

(e) That the killing was unlawful. 

### (4) During certain offenses.

(a) That a certain named or described person is dead; 

(b) That the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;

(c) That the killing was unlawful; and 

(d) That, at the time of the killing, the accused was engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of burglary, sodomy, rape, rape of a child, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, aggravated sexual abuse of a child, aggravated sexual contact with a child, robbery, or aggravated arson.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

Killing a human being is unlawful when done without justification

or excuse. _See_ R.C.M. 916. Whether an unlawful killing constitutes

murder or a lesser offense depends upon the circumstances. The offense is

committed at the place of the act or omission although the victim may have

died elsewhere. Whether death occurs at the time of the accused's act or

omission, or at some time thereafter, it must have followed from an injury

 received by the victim which resulted from the act or omission. 

### (2) Premeditated murder.

#### (a) Premeditation.

A murder is not premeditated unless the thought of taking life was

 consciously conceived and the act or omission by which it was taken was

intended. Premeditated murder is murder committed after the formation of

a specific intent to kill someone and consideration of the act intended.

It is not necessary that the intention to kill have been entertained for

any particular or considerable length of time. When a fixed purpose to kill

has been deliberately formed, it is immaterial how soon afterwards it is

put into execution. The existence of premeditation may be inferred from the

circumstances. 

#### (b) Transferred premeditation.

When an accused with a premeditated design attempted to unlawfully

 kill a certain person, but, by mistake or inadvertence, killed another person,

the accused is still criminally responsible for a premeditated murder, because

the premeditated design to kill is transferred from the intended victim to

the actual victim. 

#### (c) Intoxication.

Voluntary intoxication (_see_ R.C.M.

916(1)(2)) not amounting to legal insanity may reduce premeditated

murder (Article 118(1)) to unpremeditated murder (Article 118(2) or (3))

but it does not reduce either premeditated murder or unpremeditated murder

to manslaughter (Article 119) or any other lesser offense. 

### (3) Intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.

#### (a) Intent.

An unlawful killing without premeditation is also murder when the

 accused had either an intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm. It may

be inferred that a person intends the natural and probable consequences

of an act purposely done. Hence, if a person does an intentional act likely

to result in death or great bodily injury, it may be inferred that death

or great bodily injury was intended. The intent need not be directed toward

the person killed, or exist for any particular time before commission of

the act, or have previously existed at all. It is sufficient that it existed

at the time of the act or omission (except if death is inflicted in the

heat of a sudden passion caused by adequate provocation- _see

_ paragraph 44). For example, a person committing housebreaking who

strikes and kills the householder attempting to prevent flight can be guilty

of murder even if the householder was not seen until the moment before striking

 the fatal blow. 

#### (b) Great bodily harm.

"Great bodily harm" means serious injury; it does not

 include minor injuries such as a black eye or a bloody nose, but it does

include fractured or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members of the body,

 serious damage to internal organs, and other serious bodily injuries. It

is synonymous with the term "grievous bodily harm." 

#### (c) Intoxication.

Voluntary intoxication not amounting to legal insanity does not

 reduce unpremeditated murder to manslaughter (Article 119) or any other

lesser offense. 

### (4) Act inherently dangerous to others.

#### (a) Wanton disregard of human life.

Intentionally engaging in an act inherently dangerous to another-although

without an intent to cause the death of or great bodily harm to any particular

person, or even with a wish that death will not be caused-may also

constitute murder if the act shows wanton disregard of human life. Such disregard

 is characterized by heedlessness of the probable consequences of the act

or omission, or indifference to the likelihood of death or great bodily

harm. Examples include throwing a live grenade toward another in jest or

 flying an aircraft very low over one or more persons to cause alarm. 

#### (b) Knowledge.

The accused must know that death or great bodily harm was a probable

 consequence of the inherently dangerous act. Such knowledge may be proved

by circumstantial evidence. 

### (5) During certain offenses.

#### (a) In general.

The commission or attempted commission of any of the offenses listed

 in Article 118(4) is likely to result in homicide, and when an unlawful

killing occurs as a consequence of the perpetration or attempted perpetration

of one of these offenses, the killing is murder. Under these circumstances

it is not a defense that the killing was unintended or accidental. 

#### (b) Separate offenses.

The perpetration or attempted perpetration of the burglary, forcible sodomy,

 rape, robbery, or aggravated arson may be charged separately from the homicide.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

(1) Article 118(1) or (4)-death. Mandatory minimum-imprisonment

for life with eligibility for parole. 

(2) Article 118(2) or (3)-such punishment other than death as

a court-martial may direct.

#  Article 119-Manslaughter

## a. Text of statute.

(a) **Any person subject to this chapter who, with an intent to kill

or inflict great bodily harm, unlawfully kills a human being in the heat

of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation is guilty of voluntary

manslaughter and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

(b) **Any person subject to this chapter who, without an intent to kill

or inflict great bodily harm, unlawfully kills a human being-**

(1) **by culpable negligence; or**

(2) **while perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate an offense, other

 than those named in clause (4) of section 918 of this title (article 118),

directly affecting the person;

is guilty of involuntary manslaughter and

shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Voluntary manslaughter.

(a) That a certain named or described person is dead; 

(b) That the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;

(c) That the killing was unlawful; and 

(d) That, at the time of the killing, the accused had the intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm upon the person killed.

--LSQP--Note: Add the following if applicable--RSQP-- 

(e) That the person killed was a child under the age of 16 years. 

### (2) Involuntary manslaughter.

(a) That a certain named or described person is dead; 

(b) That the death resulted from the act or omission of the accused;

(c) That the killing was unlawful; and 

(d) That this act or omission of the accused constituted culpable negligence, or occurred while the accused was perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate an offense directly affecting the person other than burglary, forcible sodomy, rape, robbery, or aggravated arson.

--LSQP--Note: Add the following if applicable--RSQP-- 

(d) That the person killed was a child under the age of 16 years. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Voluntary manslaughter.

#### (a) Nature of offense.

An unlawful killing, although done with an intent to kill or inflict

 great bodily harm, is not murder but voluntary manslaughter if committed

in the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate provocation. Heat of passion

may result from fear or rage. A person may be provoked to such an extent

that in the heat of sudden passion caused by the provocation, although not

in necessary defense of life or to prevent bodily harm, a fatal blow may

be struck before self-control has returned. Although adequate provocation

does not excuse the homicide, it does preclude conviction of murder. 

#### (b) Nature of provocation.

The provocation must be adequate to excite uncontrollable passion

in a reasonable person, and the act of killing must be committed under and

because of the passion. However, the provocation must not be sought or induced

as an excuse for killing or doing harm. If, judged by the standard of a reasonable

person, sufficient cooling time elapses between the provocation and the killing,

the offense is murder, even if the accused's passion persists. Examples

of acts which may, depending on the circumstances, constitute adequate provocation

are the unlawful infliction of great bodily harm, unlawful imprisonment,

and the sight by one spouse of an act of adultery committed by the other

spouse. Insulting or abusive words or gestures, a slight blow with the hand

or fist, and trespass or other injury to property are not, standing alone,

adequate provocation. 

#### (c) When committed upon a child under 16 years of age. 

The maximum punishment is increased when voluntary manslaughter is committed upon a child under 16 years of age. The accused's knowledge that the child was under 16 years of age at the time of the offense is not required for the increased maximum punishment. 

### (2) Involuntary manslaughter.

#### (a) Culpable negligence.

##### (i) Nature of culpable negligence.

Culpable negligence is a degree of carelessness greater than simple

 negligence. It is a negligent act or omission accompanied by a culpable

disregard for the foreseeable consequences to others of that act or omission.

Thus, the basis of a charge of involuntary manslaughter may be a negligent

act or omission which, when viewed in the light of human experience, might

foreseeably result in the death of another, even though death would not

necessarily be a natural and probable consequence of the act or omission.

Acts which may amount to culpable negligence include negligently conducting

target practice so that the bullets go in the direction of an inhabited

house within range; pointing a pistol in jest at another and pulling the

trigger, believing, but without taking reasonable precautions to ascertain,

that it would not be dangerous; and carelessly leaving poisons or dangerous

drugs where they may endanger life. 

##### (ii) Legal duty required.

When there is no legal duty to act there can be no neglect. Thus,

 when a stranger makes no effort to save a drowning person, or a person allows

a beggar to freeze or starve to death, no crime is committed. 

#### (b) Offense directly affecting the person.

An "offense directly affecting the person" means one

 affecting some particular person as distinguished from an offense affecting

society in general. Among offenses directly affecting the person are the

various types of assault, battery, false imprisonment, voluntary engagement

in an affray, and maiming. 

#### (c) When committed upon a child under 16 years of age. 

The maximum punishment is increased when involuntary manslaughter is committed upon a child under 16 years of age. The accused's knowledge that the child was under 16 years of age at the time of the offense is not required for the increased maximum punishment.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Voluntary manslaughter.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 15 years. 

### (2) Involuntary manslaughter.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

### (3) Voluntary manslaughter of a child under 16 years of age.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 20 years. 

### (4) Involuntary manslaughter of a child under 16 years of age.

(b) That the woman was then pregnant; and 

(c) That the accused thereby intentionally killed the unborn child of that woman.

############ c. Explanation.

############# (1) Nature of offense.

 This article makes it a separate, punishable crime to cause the death of or bodily injury to an unborn child while engaged in arson (article 126, UCMJ); murder (article 118, UCMJ); voluntary manslaughter (article 119(a), UCMJ); involuntary manslaughter (article 119(b)(2), UCMJ); rape (article 120(a), UCMJ); robbery (article 122, UCMJ); maiming (article 124, UCMJ); or assault (article 128, UCMJ) against a pregnant woman. For all underlying offenses, except arson, this article requires that the victim of the underlying offense be the pregnant mother. For purposes of arson, the pregnant mother must have some nexus to the arson such that she sustained some "bodily injury" due to the arson. For the purposes of this article the term "woman" means a female of any age. This article does not permit the prosecution of any-

(a) person for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the pregnant woman, or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf, has been obtained or for which such consent is implied by law;

(b) person for any medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child; or

(c) woman with respect to her unborn child.

(2) The offenses of "injuring an unborn child" and "killing an unborn child" do not require proof that-

(a) the person engaging in the conduct (the accused) had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or

(b) the accused intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.

(3) The offense of "attempting to kill an unborn child" requires that the accused intended by his conduct to cause the death of the unborn child (See paragraph b(3)(c) above).

################### (4) Bodily injury.

 For the purpose of this offense, the term "bodily injury" is that which is provided by section 1365 of title 18, to wit: a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, or disfigurement; physical pain; illness; impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary.

#################### (5) Unborn child.

 "Unborn child" means a child in utero or a member of the species homo sapiens who is carried in the womb, at any stage of development, from conception to birth.

############ d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

############ e. Maximum punishment.

The maximum punishment for (1) Injuring an unborn child; (2) Killing an unborn child; (3) Attempting to kill an unborn child; or (4) Intentionally killing an unborn child is such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct, but shall be consistent with the punishment had the bodily injury, death, attempt to kill, or intentional killing occurred to the unborn child's mother.

(A) **The term 'consent' means a freely given agreement to the conduct at issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute consent. A current or previous dating or social or sexual relationship by itself or the manner of dress of the person involved with the accused in the conduct at issue shall not constitute consent.**

(B) **A sleeping, unconscious, or incompetent person cannot consent. A person cannot consent to force causing or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm or to being rendered unconscious. A person cannot consent while under threat or fear or under the circumstances described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection (b)(1).**

(C) **Lack of consent may be inferred based on the circumstances of the offense. All the surrounding circumstances are to be considered in determining whether a person gave consent, or whether a person did not resist or ceased to resist only because of another person's actions.**

#  Article 121-Larceny and wrongful appropriation

## a. Text of statute.

(a) **Any person subject to this chapter who wrongfully takes, obtains,

or withholds, by any means, from the possession of the owner or of any other

 person any money, personal property, or article of value of any kind-**

(1) ** with intent permanently to deprive or defraud another person of

the use and benefit of property or to appropriate it to his own use or the

use of any person other than the owner, steals that property and is guilty

of larceny; or**

(2) ** with intent temporarily to deprive or defraud another person of

the use and benefit of property or to appropriate it to his own use or the

use of any person other than the owner, is guilty of wrongful appropriation.**

(b) **Any person found guilty of larceny or wrongful appropriation shall

be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Larceny.

(a) That the accused wrongfully took, obtained, or withheld certain

 property from the possession of the owner or of any other person; 

(b) That the property belonged to a certain person; 

(c) That the property was of a certain value, or of some value; and

(d) That the taking, obtaining, or withholding by the accused was with

 the intent permanently to deprive or defraud another person of the use and

 benefit of the property or permanently to appropriate the property for the

use of the accused or for any person other than the owner.

--LSQP--Note: If the property is alleged to be military property, as defined in paragraph 46c(1)(h), add the following element--RSQP--

(e) That the property was military property. 

### (2) Wrongful appropriation.

(a) That the accused wrongfully took, obtained, or withheld certain

 property from the possession of the owner or of any other person; 

(b) That the property belonged to a certain person; 

(c) That the property was of a certain value, or of some value; and

(d) That the taking, obtaining, or withholding by the accused was with

 the intent temporarily to deprive or defraud another person of the use and

benefit of the property or temporarily to appropriate the property for the

use of the accused or for any person other than the owner. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Larceny.

#### (a) In general.

A wrongful taking with intent permanently to deprive includes the

 common law offense of larceny; a wrongful obtaining with intent permanently

to defraud includes the offense formerly known as obtaining by false pretense;

and a wrongful withholding with intent permanently to appropriate includes

the offense formerly known as embezzlement. Any of the various types of larceny

under Article 121 may be charged and proved under a specification alleging

that the accused "did steal" the property in question. 

#### (b) Taking, obtaining, or withholding.

There must be a taking, obtaining, or withholding of the property

by the thief. For instance, there is no taking if the property is connected

to a building by a chain and the property has not been disconnected from

the building; property is not "obtained" by merely acquiring

title thereto without exercising some possessory control over it. As a general

rule, however, any movement of the property or any exercise of dominion

over it is sufficient if accompanied by the requisite intent. Thus, if an

accused enticed another's horse into the accused's stable without touching

the animal, or procured a railroad company to deliver another's trunk by

changing the check on it, or obtained the delivery of another's goods to

a person or place designated by the accused, or had the funds of another

transferred to the accused's bank account, the accused is guilty of larceny

if the other elements of the offense have been proved. A person may "obtain"

 the property of another by acquiring possession without title, and one who

 already has possession of the property of another may "obtain"

it by later acquiring title to it. A "withholding" may arise

as a result of a failure to return, account for, or deliver property to its

owner when a return, accounting, or delivery is due, even if the owner has

made no demand for the property, or it may arise as a result of devoting

property to a use not authorized by its owner. Generally, this is so whether

 the person withholding the property acquired it lawfully or unlawfully. _

See_ subparagraph c(1)(f) below. However, acts which constitute the

offense of unlawfully receiving, buying, or concealing stolen property or

of being an accessory after the fact are not included within the meaning of

 "withholds." Therefore, neither a receiver of stolen property

nor an accessory after the fact can be convicted of larceny on that basis

alone. The taking, obtaining, or withholding must be of specific property.

A debtor does not withhold specific property from the possession of a creditor

by failing or refusing to pay a debt, for the relationship of debtor and

creditor does not give the creditor a possessory right in any specific money

or other property of the debtor. 

#### (c) Ownership of the property.

##### (i) In general.

Article 121 requires that the taking, obtaining, or withholding

be from the possession of the owner or of any other person. Care, custody,

management, and control are among the definitions of possession. 

##### (ii) Owner.

"Owner" refers to the person who, at the time of the

 taking, obtaining, or withholding, had the superior right to possession

of the property in the light of all conflicting interests therein which

may be involved in the particular case. For instance, an organization is the

 true owner of its funds as against the custodian of the funds charged with

the larceny thereof. 

##### (iii) Any other person.

"Any other person" means any person-even a person

 who has stolen the property-who has possession or a greater right

to possession than the accused. In pleading a violation of this article,

the ownership of the property may be alleged to have been in any person,

other than the accused, who at the time of the theft was a general owner

or a special owner thereof. A general owner of property is a person who has

title to it, whether or not that person has possession of it; a special owner,

such as a borrower or hirer, is one who does not have title but who does

have possession, or the right of possession, of the property. 

##### (iv) Person.

"Person," as used in referring to one from whose possession

property has been taken, obtained, or withheld, and to any owner of property,

includes (in addition to a natural person) a government, a corporation,

an association, an organization, and an estate. Such a person need not be

a legal entity. 

#### (d) Wrongfulness of the taking, obtaining, or withholding.

The taking, obtaining, or withholding of the property must be wrongful.

As a general rule, a taking or withholding of property from the possession

of another is wrongful if done without the consent of the other, and an

obtaining of property from the possession of another is wrongful if the obtaining

is by false pretense. However, such an act is not wrongful if it is authorized

by law or apparently lawful superior orders, or, generally, if done by a

person who has a right to the possession of the property either equal to

or greater than the right of one from whose possession the property is taken,

obtained, or withheld. An owner of property who takes or withholds it from

the possession of another, without the consent of the other, or who obtains

it therefrom by false pretense, does so wrongfully if the other has a superior

 right-such as a lien-to possession of the property. A person

who takes, obtains, or withholds property as the agent of another has the

 same rights and liabilities as does the principal, but may not be charged

with a guilty knowledge or intent of the principal which that person does

not share. 

#### (e) False pretense.

With respect to obtaining property by false pretense, the false

 pretense may be made by means of any act, word, symbol, or token. The pretense

must be in fact false when made and when the property is obtained, and it

must be knowingly false in the sense that it is made without a belief in

its truth. A false pretense is a false representation of past or existing

fact. In addition to other kinds of facts, the fact falsely represented

by a person may be that person's or another's power, authority, or intention.

Thus, a false representation by a person that person presently intends to

perform a certain act in the future is a false representation of an existing

fact-the intention-and thus a false pretense. Although the pretense

need not be the sole cause inducing the owner to part with the property,

it must be an effective and intentional cause of the obtaining. A false representation

made after the property was obtained will not result in a violation of Article

121. A larceny is committed when a person obtains the property of another

by false pretense and with intent to steal, even though the owner neither

intended nor was requested to part with title to the property. Thus, a person

who gets another's watch by pretending that it will be borrowed briefly

and then returned, but who really intends to sell it, is guilty of larceny.

#### (f) Intent.

##### (i) In general.

The offense of larceny requires that the taking, obtaining, or

withholding by the thief be accompanied by an intent permanently to deprive

or defraud another of the use and benefit of property or permanently to

appropriate the property to the thief's own use or the use of any person other

 than the owner. These intents are collectively called an intent to steal.

Although a person gets property by a taking or obtaining which was not wrongful

or which was without a concurrent intent to steal, a larceny is nevertheless

committed if an intent to steal is formed after the taking or obtaining and

the property is wrongfully withheld with that intent. For example, if a

person rents another's vehicle, later decides to keep it permanently, and

 then either fails to return it at the appointed time or uses it for a purpose

 not authorized by the terms of the rental, larceny has been committed, even

though at the time the vehicle was rented, the person intended to return

it after using it according to the agreement. 

##### (ii) Inference of intent.

An intent to steal may be proved by circumstantial evidence. Thus,

if a person secretly takes property, hides it, and denies knowing anything

about it, an intent to steal may be inferred; if the property was taken

openly and returned, this would tend to negate such an intent. Proof of sale

of the property may show an intent to steal, and therefore, evidence of such

a sale may be introduced to support a charge of larceny. An intent to steal

may be inferred from a wrongful and intentional dealing with the property

of another in a manner likely to cause that person to suffer a permanent

loss thereof. 

##### (iii) Special situations.

###### (A) Motive does not negate intent.

The accused's purpose in taking an item ordinarily is irrelevant

to the accused's guilt as long as the accused had the intent required under

subparagraph c(1)(f)(i) above. For example, if the accused wrongfully took

property as a "joke" or "to teach the owner a lesson"

this would not be a defense, although if the accused intended to return the

property, the accused would be guilty of wrongful appropriation, not larceny.

When a person takes property intending only to return it to its lawful owner,

as when stolen property is taken from a thief in order to return it to its

owner, larceny or wrongful appropriation is not committed. 

###### (B) Intent to pay for or replace property not a defense.

An intent to pay for or replace the stolen property is not a defense,

 even if that intent existed at the time of the theft. If, however, the accused

takes money or a negotiable instrument having no special value above its

face value, with the intent to return an equivalent amount of money, the

offense of larceny is not committed although wrongful appropriation may be.

###### (C) Return of property not a defense.

 Once a larceny is committed, a return of the property or payment

for it is no defense. _See_ subparagraph c(2) below when the

taking, obtaining, or withholding is with the intent to return. 

#### (g) Value.

##### (i) In general.

Value is a question of fact to be determined on the basis of all

of the evidence admitted. 

##### (ii) Government property.

When the stolen property is an item issued or procured from Government

sources, the price listed in an official publication for that property at

the time of the theft is admissible as evidence of its value. _See

_ Mil. R. Evid. 803(17). However, the stolen item must be shown to

have been, at the time of the theft, in the condition upon which the value

indicated in the official price list is based. The price listed in the official

publication is not conclusive as to the value of the item, and other evidence

may be admitted on the question of its condition and value. 

##### (iii) Other property.

As a general rule, the value of other stolen property is its legitimate

market value at the time and place of the theft. If this property, because

of its character or the place where it was stolen, had no legitimate market

value at the time and place of the theft or if that value cannot readily

be ascertained, its value may be determined by its legitimate market value

in the United States at the time of the theft, or by its replacement cost

at that time, whichever is less. Market value may be established by proof

of the recent purchase price paid for the article in the legitimate market

 involved or by testimony or other admissible evidence from any person who

is familiar through training or experience with the market value in question.

The owner of the property may testify as to its market value if familiar

with its quality and condition. The fact that the owner is not an expert

of the market value of the property goes only to the weight to be given

that testimony, and not to its admissibility. _ See_ Mil. R.

Evid. 701. When the character of the property clearly appears in evidence-for

instance, when it is exhibited to the court-martial-the court-martial,

from its own experience, may infer that it has some value. If as a matter

 of common knowledge the property is obviously of a value substantially in

 excess of $500.00, the court-martial may find a value of more than $500.00.

Writings representing value may be considered to have the value-even

 though contingent-which they represented at the time of the theft.

##### (iv) Limited interest in property.

If an owner of property or someone acting in the owner's behalf

 steals it from a person who has a superior, but limited, interest in the

property, such as a lien, the value for punishment purposes shall be that

of the limited interest. 

#### (h) Military Property.

Military property is all property, real or personal, owned, held, or used by one of the armed forces of the United States. Military property is a term of art, and should not be confused with government property. The terms are not interchangeable. While all military property is government property, not all government property is military property. An item of government property is not military property unless the item in question meets the definition provided above. Retail merchandise of service exchange stores is not military property under this article.

##### (i) Miscellaneous considerations.

###### (i) Lost property.

A taking or withholding of lost property by the finder is larceny

if accompanied by an intent to steal and if a clue to the identity of the

general or special owner, or through which such identity may be traced,

is furnished by the character, location, or marketing of the property, or

by other circumstances. 

###### (ii) Multiple article larceny.

When a larceny of several articles is committed at substantially

the same time and place, it is a single larceny even though the articles

belong to different persons. Thus, if a thief steals a suitcase containing

 the property of several persons or goes into a room and takes property belonging

to various persons, there is but one larceny, which should be alleged in

but one specification. 

###### (iii) Special kinds of property which may also be the subject of larceny.

Included in property which may be the subject of larceny is property

 which is taken, obtained, or withheld by severing it from real estate and

writings which represent value such as commercial paper. 

###### (iv) Services.

Theft of services may not be charged under this paragraph, but_

 see_ paragraph 78. 

###### (vi)  Credit, Debit, and Electronic Transactions.

Wrongfully engaging in a credit, debit, or electronic transaction

to obtain goods or money is an obtaining-type larceny by false pretense.

 Such use to obtain goods is usually a larceny of those goods from the merchant

offering them. Such use to obtain money or a negotiable instrument (e.g.,

withdrawing cash from an automated teller or a cash advance from a bank)

is usually a larceny of money from the entity presenting the money or a

negotiable instrument. For the purpose of this section, the term 'credit,

debit, or electronic transaction' includes the use of an instrument

or device, whether known as a credit card, debit card, automated teller

machine (ATM) card or by any other name, including access devices such as

code, account number, electronic serial number or personal identification

number, issued for the use in obtaining money, goods, or anything else of

value. 

### (2) Wrongful appropriation.

#### (a) In general.

Wrongful appropriation requires an intent to temporarily-as

 opposed to permanently-deprive the owner of the use and benefit of,

or appropriate to the use of another, the property wrongfully taken, withheld,

or obtained. In all other respects wrongful appropriation and larceny are

identical. 

#### (b) Examples.

Wrongful appropriation includes: taking another's automobile without

 permission or lawful authority with intent to drive it a short distance

and then return it or cause it to be returned to the owner; obtaining a

service weapon by falsely pretending to be about to go on guard duty with

 intent to use it on a hunting trip and later return it; and while driving

a government vehicle on a mission to deliver supplies, withholding the vehicle

from government service by deviating from the assigned route without authority,

to visit a friend in a nearby town and later restore the vehicle to its lawful

use. An inadvertent exercise of control over the property of another will

not result in wrongful appropriation. For example, a person who fails to

return a borrowed boat at the time agreed upon because the boat inadvertently

went aground is not guilty of this offense. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Larceny.

#### (a) Military property of a value of $500 or less.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

#### (b) Property other than military property of a value of $500 or less.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 6 months. 

#### (c) Military property of a value of more than $500 or of any military motor

 vehicle, aircraft, vessel, firearm, or explosive.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

#### (d) Property other than military property of a value of more than $500

or any motor vehicle, aircraft, vessel, firearm, or explosive not included

in subparagraph e(1)(c).

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years. 

### (2) Wrongful appropriation.

#### (a) Of a value of $500.00 or less.

Confinement for 3 months, and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month

 for 3 months. 

#### (b) Of a value of more than $500.00.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 6 months. 

#### (c) Of any motor vehicle, aircraft, vessel, firearm, or explosive.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years.

#  Article 122-Robbery

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who

with intent to steal takes anything of value from the person or in the presence

of another, against his will, by means of force or violence or fear of immediate

or future injury to his person or property or to the person or property of

a relative or member of his family or of anyone in his company at the time

of the robbery, is guilty of robbery and shall be punished as a court-martial

may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused wrongfully took certain property from the person

or from the possession and in the presence of a person named or described;

(2) That the taking was against the will of that person; 

(3) That the taking was by means of force, violence, or force and violence,

or putting the person in fear of immediate or future injury to that person,

a relative, a member of the person's family, anyone accompanying the person

at the time of the robbery, the person's property, or the property of a

relative, family member, or anyone accompanying the person at the time of

the robbery; 

(4) That the property belonged to a person named or described; 

(5) That the property was of a certain or of some value; and 

(6) That the taking of the property by the accused was with the intent

 permanently to deprive the person robbed of the use and benefit of the property.

--LSQP--Note: If the robbery was committed with a firearm, add the

 following element--RSQP--

 

(7) That the means of force or violence or of putting the person in

fear was a firearm. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Taking in the presence of the victim.

It is not necessary that the property taken be located within any

 certain distance of the victim. If persons enter a house and force the owner

by threats to disclose the hiding place of valuables in an adjoining room,

and, leaving the owner tied, go into that room and steal the valuables, they

have committed robbery. 

### (2) Force or violence.

For a robbery to be committed by force or violence, there must be

 actual force or violence to the person, preceding or accompanying the taking

against the person's will, and it is immaterial that there is no fear engendered

in the victim. Any amount of force is enough to constitute robbery if the

force overcomes the actual resistance of the person robbed, puts the person

in such a position that no resistance is made, or suffices to overcome the

resistance offered by a chain or other fastening by which the article is

attached to the person. The offense is not robbery if an article is merely

 snatched from the hand of another or a pocket is picked by stealth, no other

force is used, and the owner is not put in fear. But if resistance is overcome

in snatching the article, there is sufficient violence, as when an earring

is torn from a person's ear. There is sufficient violence when a person's

attention is diverted by being jostled by a confederate of a pickpocket,

who is thus enabled to steal the person's watch, even though the person had

no knowledge of the act; or when a person is knocked insensible and that

person's pockets rifled; or when a guard steals property from the person

of a prisoner in the guard's charge after handcuffing the prisoner on the

pretext of preventing escape. 

### (3) Fear.

For a robbery to be committed by putting the victim in fear, there

 need be no actual force or violence, but there must be a demonstration of

force or menace by which the victim is placed in such fear that the victim

is warranted in making no resistance. The fear must be a reasonable apprehension

of present or future injury, and the taking must occur while the apprehension

exists. The injury apprehended may be death or bodily injury to the person

or to a relative or family member, or to anyone in the person's company at

the time, or it may be the destruction of the person's habitation or other

property or that of a relative or family member or anyone in the person's

company at the time of sufficient gravity to warrant giving up the property

demanded by the assailant. 

### (4) Larceny by taking.

Robbery includes "taking with intent to steal"; hence,

a larceny by taking is an integral part of a charge of robbery and must

be proved at the trial. _ See_ paragraph 46c(1). 

### (5) Multiple-victim robberies.

Robberies of different persons at the same time and place are separate

offenses and each such robbery should be alleged in a separate specification.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) When committed with a firearm.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 15 years. 

### (2) Other cases.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

## f. Sample specifications.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

 data), did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data,

if required), on or about   20 ,

in fear) (with a firearm) steal from the (person) (presence) of   , against his/her will, (a watch) (  ) of

#  Article 123-Forgery

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, with

intent to defraud-**

(1) **falsely makes or alters any signature to, or any part of, any writing

 which would, if genuine, apparently impose a legal liability on another or

change his legal right or liability to his prejudice; or**

(2) **utters, offers, issues, or transfers such a writing, known by him

to be so made or altered; is guilty of forgery and shall be punished as a

court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Forgery-making or altering.

(a) That the accused falsely made or altered a certain signature or

writing; 

(b) That the signature or writing was of a nature which would, if genuine,

apparently impose a legal liability on another or change another's legal

rights or liabilities to that person's prejudice; and

(c) That the false making or altering was with the intent to defraud.

### (2) Forgery-uttering.

(a) That a certain signature or writing was falsely made or altered;

(b) That the signature or writing was of a nature which would, if genuine,

apparently impose a legal liability on another or change another's legal

rights or liabilities to that person's prejudice; 

(c) That the accused uttered, offered, issued, or transferred the signature

or writing; 

(d) That at such time the accused knew that the signature or writing

had been falsely made or altered; and 

(e) That the uttering, offering, issuing or transferring was with the

intent to defraud. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

Forgery may be committed either by falsely making a writing or by

knowingly uttering a falsely made writing. There are three elements common

to both aspects of forgery: a writing falsely made or altered; and apparent

capability of the writing as falsely made or altered to impose a legal liability

on another or to change another's legal rights or liabilities to that person's

prejudice; and an intent to defraud. 

### (2) False.

"False" refers not to the contents of the writing or

to the facts stated therein but to the making or altering of it. Hence,

forgery is not committed by the genuine making of a false instrument even

when made with intent to defraud. A person who, with intent to defraud, signs

that person's own signature as the maker of a check drawn on a bank in which

that person does not have money or credit does not commit forgery. Although

the check falsely represents the existence of the account, it is what it

purports to be, a check drawn by the actual maker, and therefore it is not

falsely made. _ See_, however, paragraph 49. Likewise, if

a person makes a false signature of another to an instrument, but adds the

word "by" with that person's own signature thus indicating authority

to sign, the offense is not forgery even if no such authority exists. False

recitals of fact in a genuine document, as an aircraft flight report which

is "padded" by the one preparing it, do not make the writing

a forgery. _But see_ paragraph 31 concerning false official

statements. 

### (3) Signatures.

Signing the name of another to an instrument having apparent legal

 efficacy without authority and with intent to defraud is forgery as the

signature is falsely made. The distinction is that in this case the falsely

made signature purports to be the act of one other than the actual signer.

Likewise, a forgery may be committed by a person signing that person's own

name to an instrument. For example, when a check payable to the order of

a certain person comes into the hands of another of the same name, forgery

is committed if, knowing the check to be another's, that person indorses

it with that person's own name intending to defraud. Forgery may also be

committed by signing a fictitious name, as when Roe makes a check payable

 to Roe and signs it with a fictitious name-Doe-as drawer. 

### (4) Nature of writing.

The writing must be one which would, if genuine, apparently impose

a legal liability on another, as a check or promissory note, or change that

person's legal rights or liabilities to that person's prejudice, as a receipt.

Some other instruments which may be the subject of forgery are orders for

the delivery of money or goods, railroad tickets, and military orders directing

travel. A writing falsely "made" includes an instrument that

may be partially or entirely printed, engraved, written with a pencil, or

made by photography or other device. A writing may be falsely "made"

by materially altering an existing writing, by filling in a paper signed

in blank, or by signing an instrument already written. With respect to the apparent legal efficacy of the writing falsely made or altered, the writing must appear either on its face or from extrinsic facts to impose a legal

liability on another, or to change a legal right or liability to the prejudice

of another. If under all the circumstances the instrument has neither real

nor apparent legal efficacy, there is no forgery. Thus, the false making

with intent to defraud of an instrument affirmatively invalid on its face

is not forgery nor is the false making or altering, with intent to defraud,

of a writing which could not impose a legal liability, as a mere letter of

introduction. However, the false making of another's signature on an instrument

with intent to defraud is forgery, even if there is no resemblance to the

genuine signature and the name is misspelled. 

### (5) Intent to defraud.

 _See_ paragraph 49c(14). The intent to defraud need

not be directed toward anyone in particular nor be for the advantage of

the offender.

It is immaterial that nobody was actually defrauded, or that

no further step was made toward carrying out the intent to defraud other

than the false making or altering of a writing. 

### (6) Alteration.

The alteration must effect a material change in the legal tenor

of the writing. Thus, an alteration which apparently increases, diminishes,

or discharges any obligation is material. Examples of material alterations

 in the case of a promissory note are changing the date, amount, or place

of payment. If a genuine writing has been delivered to the accused and while

in the accused's possession is later found to be altered, it may be inferred

that the writing was altered by the accused. 

### (7) Uttering.

 _See_ paragraph 49c(4). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years. 

## f. Sample specifications.

### (1) Forgery-making or altering.

#  Article 123a-Making, drawing, or uttering check, draft, or order

without sufficient funds

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who-**

(1) **for the procurement of any article or thing of value, with

 intent to defraud; or** 

(2) **for the payment of any past due obligation, or for any other

 purpose, with intent to deceive; makes, draws, utters, or delivers any check,

draft, or order for the payment of money upon any bank or other depository,

knowing at the time that the maker or drawer has not or will not have sufficient

funds in, or credit with, the bank or other depository for the payment of

that check, draft, or order in full upon its presentment, shall be punished

as a court-martial may direct. The making, drawing, uttering, or delivering

by a maker or drawer of a check, draft, or order, payment of which is refused

by the drawee because of insufficient funds of the maker or drawer in the

drawee's possession or control, is prima facie evidence of his intent to

defraud or deceive and of his knowledge of insufficient funds in, or credit

with, that bank or other depository, unless the maker or drawer pays the

holder the amount due within five days after receiving notice, orally or

in writing, that the check, draft, or order was not paid on presentment.

In this section, the word "credit" means an arrangement or understanding,

express or implied, with the bank or other depository for the payment of

that check, draft, or order.** 

## b. Elements.

### (1) For the procurement of any article or thing of value, with intent to

 defraud.

(a) That the accused made, drew, uttered, or delivered a check, draft,

or order for the payment of money payable to a named person or organization;

(b) That the accused did so for the purpose of procuring an article

or thing of value; 

(c) That the act was committed with intent to defraud; and 

(d) That at the time of making, drawing, uttering, or delivery of the

 instrument the accused knew that the accused or the maker or drawer had

not or would not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bank or other

depository for the payment thereof upon presentment. 

### (2) For the payment of any past due obligation, or for any other purpose,

 with intent to deceive.

(a) That the accused made, drew, uttered, or delivered a check, draft,

or order for the payment of money payable to a named person or organization;

(b) That the accused did so for the purpose or purported purpose of

 effecting the payment of a past due obligation or for some other purpose;

(c) That the act was committed with intent to deceive; and 

(d) That at the time of making, drawing, uttering, or delivering of

the instrument, the accused knew that the accused or the maker or drawer

had not or would not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bank

or other depository for the payment thereof upon presentment. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Written instruments.

The written instruments covered by this article include any check,

 draft (including share drafts), or order for the payment of money drawn

upon any bank or other depository, whether or not the drawer bank or depository

is actually in existence. It may be inferred that every check, draft, or

order carries with it a representation that the instrument will be paid in

full by the bank or other depository upon presentment by a holder when due.

### (2) Bank or other depository.

"Bank or other depository" includes any business regularly

but not necessarily exclusively engaged in public banking activities. 

### (3) Making or drawing.

"Making" and "drawing" are synonymous and

 refer to the act of writing and signing the instrument. 

### (4) Uttering or delivering.

"Uttering" and "delivering" have similar

 meanings. Both mean transferring the instrument to another, but "uttering"

has the additional meaning of offering to transfer. A person need not personally

be the maker or drawer of an instrument in order to violate this article

if that person utters or delivers it. For example, if a person holds a check

which that person knows is worthless, and utters or delivers the check to

another, that person may be guilty of an offense under this article despite

the fact that the person did not personally draw the check. 

### (5) For the procurement.

"For the procurement" means for the purpose of obtaining

 any article or thing of value. It is not necessary that an article or thing

of value actually be obtained, and the purpose of the obtaining may be for

the accused's own use or benefit or for the use or benefit of another. 

### (6) For the payment.

"For the payment" means for the purpose or purported

 purpose of satisfying in whole or in part any past due obligation. Payment

need not be legally effected. 

### (7) For any other purpose.

"For any other purpose" includes all purposes other

than the payment of a past due obligation or the procurement of any article

or thing of value. For example, it includes paying or purporting to pay

an obligation which is not yet past due. The check, draft, or order, whether

 made or negotiated for the procurement of an article or thing of value or

for the payment of a past due obligation or for some other purpose, need

not be intended or represented as payable immediately. For example, the

making of a postdated check, delivered at the time of entering into an installment

purchase contract and intended as payment for a future installment, would,

if made with the requisite intent and knowledge, be a violation of this

article. 

### (8) Article or thing of value.

"Article or thing of value" extends to every kind of

 right or interest in property, or derived from contract, including interests

and rights which are intangible or contingent or which mature in the future.

### (9) Past due obligation.

A "past due obligation" is an obligation to pay money,

 which obligation has legally matured before making, drawing, uttering, or

delivering the instrument. 

### (10) Knowledge.

The accused must have knowledge, at the time the accused makes,

 draws, utters, or delivers the instrument, that the maker or drawer, whether

the accused or another, has not or will not have sufficient funds in, or

credit with, the bank or other depository for the payment of the instrument

in full upon its presentment. Such knowledge may be proved by circumstantial

evidence. 

### (11) Sufficient funds.

"Sufficient funds" refers to a condition in which the

 account balance of the maker or drawer in the bank or other depository at

the time of the presentment of the instrument for payment is not less than

the face amount of the instrument and has not been rendered unavailable for

payment by garnishment, attachment, or other legal procedures. 

### (12) Credit.

"Credit" means an arrangement or understanding, express

 or implied, with the bank or other depository for the payment of the check,

draft, or order. An absence of credit includes those situations in which

 an accused writes a check on a nonexistent bank or on a bank in which the

 accused has no account. 

### (13) Upon its presentment.

"Upon its presentment" refers to the time the demand

for payment is made upon presentation of the instrument to the bank or other

depository on which it was drawn. 

### (14) Intent to defraud.

"Intent to defraud" means an intent to obtain, through

a misrepresentation, an article or thing of value and to apply it to one's

own use and benefit or to the use and benefit of another, either permanently

 or temporarily. 

### (15) Intent to deceive.

"Intent to deceive" means an intent to mislead, cheat,

or trick another by means of a misrepresentation made for the purpose of

gaining an advantage for oneself or for a third person, or of bringing about

a disadvantage to the interests of the person to whom the representation

was made or to interests represented by that person. 

### (16) The relationship of time and intent.

Under this article, two times are involved: (a) when the accused

 makes, draws, utters, or delivers the instrument; and (b) when the instrument

is presented to the bank or other depository for payment. With respect to

(a), the accused must possess the requisite intent and must know that the

 maker or drawer does not have or will not have sufficient funds in, or credit

with, the bank or the depository for payment of the instrument in full upon

its presentment when due. With respect to (b), if it can otherwise be shown

that the accused possessed the requisite intent and knowledge at the time

the accused made, drew, uttered, or delivered the instrument, neither proof

of presentment nor refusal of payment is necessary, as when the instrument

is one drawn on a nonexistent bank. 

### (17) Statutory rule of evidence.

The provision of this article with respect to establishing prima

 facie evidence of knowledge and intent by proof of notice and nonpayment

within 5 days is a statutory rule of evidence. The failure of an accused

who is a maker or drawer to pay the holder the amount due within 5 days after

receiving either oral or written notice from the holder of a check, draft,

or order, or from any other person having knowledge that such check, draft,

or order was returned unpaid because of insufficient funds, is prima facie

evidence (a) that the accused had the intent to defraud or deceive as alleged;

and (b) that the accused knew at the time the accused made, drew, uttered,

or delivered the check, draft, or order that the accused did not have or

would not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bank or other depository

for the payment of such check, draft, or order upon its presentment for

payment. Prima facie evidence is that evidence from which the accused's

intent to defraud or deceive and the accused's knowledge of insufficient funds

 in or credit with the bank or other depository may be inferred, depending

on all the circumstances. The failure to give notice referred to in the

article, or payment by the accused, maker, or drawer to the holder of the

amount due within 5 days after such notice has been given, precludes the

prosecution from using the statutory rule of evidence but does not preclude

conviction of this offense if all the elements are otherwise proved. 

### (18) Affirmative defense.

Honest mistake is an affirmative defense to offenses under this

article. _See_ R.C.M. 916(j). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) For the procurement of any article or thing of value, with intent to

defraud, in the face amount of:

#### (a) $500.00 or less.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

confinement for 6 months. 

#### (b) More than $500.00.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

confinement for 5 years. 

### (2) For the payment of any past due obligation, or for any other purpose,

with intent to deceive.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 6 months.

#  Article 124-Maiming

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, with intent

to injure, disfigure, or disable, inflicts upon the person of another an

injury which-** 

(1) **seriously disfigures his person by any mutilation thereof;**

(2) **destroys or disables any member or organ of his body; or**

(3) **seriously diminishes his physical vigor by the injury of

any member or organ; is guilty of maiming and shall be punished as a court-martial

may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused inflicted a certain injury upon a certain person;

(2) That this injury seriously disfigured the person's body, destroyed

or disabled an organ or member, or seriously diminished the person's physical

vigor by the injury to an organ or member; and 

(3) That the accused inflicted this injury with an intent to cause some

 injury to a person. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Nature of offense.

It is maiming to put out a person's eye, to cut off a hand, foot,

or finger, or to knock out a tooth, as these injuries destroy or disable

those members or organs. It is also maiming to injure an internal organ

so as to seriously diminish the physical vigor of a person. Likewise, it

is maiming to cut off an ear or to scar a face with acid, as these injuries

seriously disfigure a person. A disfigurement need not mutilate any entire

member to come within the article, or be of any particular type, but must

be such as to impair perceptibly and materially the victim's comeliness.

The disfigurement, diminishment of vigor, or destruction or disablement

of any member or organ must be a serious injury of a substantially permanent

nature. However, the offense is complete if such an injury is inflicted even

though there is a possibility that the victim may eventually recover the

use of the member or organ, or that the disfigurement may be cured by surgery.

### (2) Means of inflicting injury.

To prove the offense it is not necessary to prove the specific means

 by which the injury was inflicted. However, such evidence may be considered

on the question of intent. 

### (3) Intent.

Maiming requires a specific intent to injure generally but not a

 specific intent to maim. Thus, one commits the offense who intends only

a slight injury, if in fact there is infliction of an injury of the type

specified in this article. Infliction of the type of injuries specified in

this article upon the person of another may support an inference of the intent

to injure, disfigure, or disable. 

### (4) Defenses.

If the injury is done under circumstances which would justify or

 excuse homicide, the offense of maiming is not committed. _See_ R.C.M.

916. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 20 years.

## f. Sample specification.

 

In that  (personal jurisdiction data),

did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if

required) on or about   20 ,

 maim  by (crushing his/her foot with a sledge hammer)

 (  ).

(2) For purposes of this Article, the term "force" means an act of force done without legal justification or excuse.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A.

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Forcible sodomy.

 Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for life without eligibility for parole. Mandatory minimum - Dismissal or dishonorable discharge.

#  Article 126-Arson

## a. Text of statute.

(a) **Any person subject to this chapter who willfully and maliciously

burns or sets on fire an inhabited dwelling, or any other structure, movable

or immovable, wherein to the knowledge of the offender there is at the time

a human being, is guilty of aggravated arson and shall be punished as a court-martial

may direct.**

(b) **Any person subject to this chapter who willfully and maliciously

burns or sets fire to the property of another, except as provided in subsection

(a), is guilty of simple arson and shall be punished as a court-martial may

direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Aggravated arson.

#### (a) Inhabited dwelling.

(i) That the accused burned or set on fire an inhabited dwelling; 

(ii) That this dwelling belonged to a certain person and was of a certain

 value; and 

(iii) That the act was willful and malicious. 

#### (b) Structure.

(i) That the accused burned or set on fire a certain structure; 

(ii) That the act was willful and malicious; 

(iii) That there was a human being in the structure at the time; 

(iv) That the accused knew that there was a human being in the structure

 at the time; and 

(v) That this structure belonged to a certain person and was of a certain

value. 

### (2) Simple arson.

(a) That the accused burned or set fire to certain property of another;

(b) That the property was of a certain value; and 

(c) That the act was willful and malicious. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

In aggravated arson, danger to human life is the essential element;

 in simple arson, it is injury to the property of another. In either case,

it is immaterial that no one is, in fact, injured. It must be shown that

the accused set the fire willfully and maliciously, that is, not merely by

negligence or accident. 

### (2) Aggravated arson.

#### (a) Inhabited dwelling.

An inhabited dwelling includes the outbuildings that form part of

the cluster of buildings used as a residence. A shop or store is not an

inhabited dwelling unless occupied as such, nor is a house that has never

 been occupied or which has been temporarily abandoned. A person may be guilty

 of aggravated arson of the person's dwelling, whether as owner or tenant.

#### (b) Structure.

Aggravated arson may also be committed by burning or setting on

fire any other structure, movable or immovable, such as a theater, church,

boat, trailer, tent, auditorium, or any other sort of shelter or edifice,

 whether public or private, when the offender knows that there is a human

being inside at the time. It may be that the offender had this knowledge

when the nature of the structure-as a department store or theater

during hours of business, or other circumstances-are shown to have

been such that a reasonable person would have known that a human being was

inside at the time. 

#### (c) Damage to property.

It is not necessary that the dwelling or structure be consumed or

 materially injured; it is enough if fire is actually communicated to any

part thereof. Any actual burning or charring is sufficient, but a mere scorching

or discoloration by heat is not. 

#### (d) Value and ownership of property.

For the offense of aggravated arson, the value and ownership of

the dwelling or other structure are immaterial, but should ordinarily be

alleged and proved to permit the finding in an appropriate case of the included

offense of simple arson. 

### (3) Simple arson.

"Simple arson" is the willful and malicious burning

or setting fire to the property of another under circumstances not amounting

to aggravated arson. The offense includes burning or setting fire to real

or personal property of someone other than the offender. _See also

_ paragraph 67 (Burning with intent to defraud). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Aggravated arson.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 20 years. 

### (2) Simple arson, where the property is-

#### (a) Of a value of $500.00 or less.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

#### (b) Of a value of more than $500.00.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years.

#  Article 127-Extortion

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who communicates

threats to another person with the intention thereby to obtain anything

of value or any acquittance, advantage, or immunity is guilty of extortion

 and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused communicated a certain threat to another; and

(2) That the accused intended to unlawfully obtain something of value,

or any acquittance, advantage, or immunity. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

Extortion is complete upon communication of the threat with the

 requisite intent. The actual or probable success of the extortion need not

be proved. 

### (2) Threat.

A threat may be communicated by any means but must be received by

the intended victim. The threat may be: a threat to do any unlawful injury

to the person or property of the person threatened or to any member of that

person's family or any other person held dear to that person; a threat to

accuse the person threatened, or any member of that persons's family or any

other person held dear to that person, of any crime; a threat to expose

or impute any deformity or disgrace to the person threatened or to any member

of that person's family or any other person held dear to that person; a threat

to expose any secret affecting the person threatened or any member of that

person's family or any other person held dear to that person; or a threat

 to do any other harm. 

### (3) Acquittance.

An "acquittance" is a release or discharge from an

obligation. 

### (4) Advantage or immunity.

Unless it is clear from the circumstances, the advantage or immunity

 sought should be described in the specification. An intent to make a person

do an act against that person's will is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute

extortion. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 3 years. 

## f. Sample specification.

 

In that  (personal jurisdiction data),

 advantage, to wit  ) (an immunity, to wit   ), communicate to  a threat to (here describe

the threat). 

#  Article 128-Assault

## a. Text of statute.

(a) **Any person subject to this chapter who attempts or offers with

 (Note: Add any of the following as applicable)

(v) That the injury was inflicted with a loaded firearm.

(vi) That the person was a child under the age of 16 years.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Simple assault.

#### (a) Definition of assault.

An "assault" is an attempt or offer with unlawful force

 or violence to do bodily harm to another, whether or not the attempt or

offer is consummated. It must be done without legal justification or excuse

and without the lawful consent of the person affected. "Bodily harm"

means any offensive touching of another, however slight. 

#### (b) Difference between "attempt" and "offer" type

assaults.

##### (i) Attempt type assault.

An "attempt" type assault requires a specific intent

to inflict bodily harm, and an overt act-that is, an act that amounts

to more than mere preparation and apparently tends to effect the intended

 bodily harm. An attempt type assault may be committed even though the victim

had no knowledge of the incident at the time. 

##### (ii) Offer type assault.

An "offer" type assault is an unlawful demonstration

of violence, either by an intentional or by a culpably negligent act or omission,

which creates in the mind of another a reasonable apprehension of receiving

immediate bodily harm. Specific intent to inflict bodily harm is not required.

##### (iii) Examples.

(A) If Doe swings a fist at Roe's head intending to hit Roe but misses,

Doe has committed an attempt type assault, whether or not Roe is aware of

the attempt. 

(B) If Doe swings a fist in the direct of Roe's head either intentionally

or as a result of culpable negligence, and Roe sees the blow coming and is

thereby put in apprehension of being struck, Doe has committed an offer type

assault whether or not Doe intended to hit Roe. 

(C) If Doe swings at Roe's head, intending to hit it, and Roe sees the

blow coming and is thereby put in apprehension of being struck, Doe has committed

both on offer and an attempt type assault. 

(D) If Doe swings at Roe's head simply to frighten Roe, not intending

to hit Roe, and Roe does not see the blow and is not placed in fear, then

no assault of any type has been committed. 

#### (c) Situations not amounting to assault.

##### (i) Mere preparation.

Preparation not amounting to an overt act, such as picking up a

stone without any attempt or offer to throw it, does not constitute an assault.

##### (ii) Threatening words.

The use of threatening words alone does not constitute an assault.

However, if the threatening words are accompanied by a menacing act or gesture,

there may be an assault, since the combination constitutes a demonstration

of violence. 

##### (iii) Circumstances negating intent to harm.

If the circumstances known to the person menaced clearly negate

an intent to do bodily harm there is no assault. Thus, if a person accompanies

an apparent attempt to strike another by an unequivocal announcement in some

form of an intention not to strike, there is no assault. For example, if Doe

raises a stick and shakes it at Roe within striking distance saying, "If

you weren't an old man, I would knock you down," Doe has committed

no assault. However, an offer to inflict bodily injury upon another instantly

 if that person does not comply with a demand which the assailant has no lawful

right to make is an assault. Thus, if Doe points a pistol at Roe and says,

"If you don't hand over your watch, I will shoot you," Doe has

committed an assault upon Roe. _See also_ paragraph 47 (robbery)

of this part. 

#### (d) Situations not constituting defenses to assault.

##### (i) Assault attempt fails.

It is not a defense to a charge of assault that for some reason

unknown to the assailant, an assault attempt was bound to fail. Thus, if

a person loads a rifle with what is believed to be a good cartridge and,

pointing it at another, pulls the trigger, that person may be guilty of assault

although the cartridge was defective and did not fire. Likewise, if a person

in a house shoots through the roof at a place where a policeman is believed

to be, that person may be guilty of assault even though the policeman is at

another place on the roof. 

##### (ii) Retreating victim.

An assault is complete if there is a demonstration of violence and

an apparent ability to inflict bodily injury causing the person at whom it

was directed to reasonably apprehend that unless the person retreats bodily

harm will be inflicted. This is true even though the victim retreated and

was never within actual striking distance of the assailant. There must, however,

be an apparent present ability to inflict the injury. Thus, to aim a pistol

at a person at such a distance that it clearly could not injure would not

be an assault. 

### (2) Battery.

#### (a) In general.

A "battery" is an assault in which the attempt or offer

to do bodily harm is consummated by the infliction of that harm. 

#### (b) Application of force.

The force applied in a battery may have been directly or indirectly

applied. Thus, a battery can be committed by inflicting bodily injury on

a person through striking the horse on which the person is mounted causing

the horse to throw the person, as well as by striking the person directly.

#### (c) Examples of battery.

It may be a battery to spit on another, push a third person against

 another, set a dog at another which bites the person, cut another's clothes

while the person is wearing them though without touching or intending to

touch the person, shoot a person, cause a person to take poison, or drive

an automobile into a person. A person who, although excused in using force,

uses more force than is required, commits a battery. Throwing an object

into a crowd may be a battery on anyone whom the object hits. 

#### (d) Situations not constituting battery.

If bodily harm is inflicted unintentionally and without culpable

 negligence, there is no battery. It is also not a battery to touch another

to attract the other's attention or to prevent injury. 

### (3) Assaults permitting increased punishment based on status of victims.

#### (a) Assault upon a commissioned, warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer.

The maximum punishment is increased when assault is committed upon

a commissioned officer of the armed forces of the United States, or of a

friendly foreign power, or upon a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer

of the armed forces of the United States. Knowledge of the status of the

victim is an essential element of the offense and may be proved by circumstantial

evidence. It is not necessary that the victim be superior in rank or command

to the accused, that the victim be in the same armed force, or that the victim

be in the execution of office at the time of the assault. 

#### (b) Assault upon a sentinel or lookout in the execution of duty, or upon

a person in the execution of law enforcement duties.

The maximum punishment is increased when assault is committed upon

a sentinel or lookout in the execution of duty or upon a person who was

then performing security police, military police, shore patrol, master at

arms, or other military or civilian law enforcement duties. Knowledge of

the status of the victim is an essential element of this offense and may

be proved by circumstantial evidence. _See_ paragraph 38c(4)

for the definition of "sentinel or lookout." 

#### (c) Assault consummated by a battery upon a child under 16 years of age.

The maximum punishment is increased when assault consummated by

a battery is committed upon a child under 16 years of age. Knowledge that

the person assaulted was under 16 years of age is not an element of this

 offense. 

### (4) Aggravated assault.

#### (a) Assault with a dangerous weapon or other means or force likely to

produce death or grievous bodily harm.

##### (i) Dangerous weapon.

A weapon is dangerous when used in a manner likely to produce death

 or grievous bodily harm. 

##### (ii) Other means or force.

The phrase "other means or force" may include any means

 or instrumentality not normally considered a weapon. When the natural and

probable consequence of a particular use of any means or force would be

death or grievous bodily harm, it may be inferred that the means or force

is "likely" to produce that result. The use to which a certain

kind of instrument is ordinarily put is irrelevant to the question of its

method of employment in a particular case. Thus, a bottle, beer glass, a

rock, a bunk adaptor, a piece of pipe, a piece of wood, boiling water, drugs,

or a rifle butt may be used in a manner likely to inflict death or grievous

bodily harm. On the other hand, an unloaded pistol, when presented as a firearm

and not as a bludgeon, is not a dangerous weapon or a means of force likely

to produce grievous bodily harm, whether or not the assailant knew it was

unloaded. 

##### (iii) Grievous bodily harm.

"Grievous bodily harm" means serious bodily injury.

It does not include minor injuries, such as a black eye or a bloody nose,

but does include fractured or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members

of the body, serious damage to internal organs, and other serious bodily

injuries. 

##### (iv) Death or injury not required.

It is not necessary that death or grievous bodily harm be actually

 inflicted to prove assault with a dangerous weapon or means likely to produce

grievous bodily harm. 

##### (v) When committed upon a child under 16 years of age.

The maximum punishment is increased when aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon or means likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm is inflicted upon a child under 16 years of age. Knowledge that the person assaulted was under the age of 16 years is not an element of the offense.

#### (b) Assault in which grievous bodily harm is intentionally inflicted.

##### (i) In general.

It must be proved that the accused specifically intended to and

did inflict grievous bodily harm. Culpable negligence will not suffice.

##### (ii) Proving intent.

Specific intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence. When

grievous bodily harm has been inflicted by means of intentionally using force

in a manner likely to achieve that result, it may be inferred that grievous

 bodily harm was intended. On the other hand, that inference might not be

drawn if a person struck another with a fist in a sidewalk fight even if

the victim fell so that the victim's head hit the curbstone and a skull

fracture resulted. It is possible, however, to commit this kind of aggravated

 assault with the fists, as when the victim is held by one of several assailants

while the others beat the victim with their fists and break a nose, jaw,

or rib. 

##### (iii) Grievous bodily harm.

 _See_ subparagraph (4)(a)(iii). 

##### (iv) When committed on a child under 16 years of age.

The maximum punishment is increased when aggravated assault with intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm is inflicted upon a child under 16 years of age. Knowledge that the person assaulted was under the age of 16 years is not an element of the offense.

#  Article 129-Burglary

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who, with intent

to commit an offense punishable under sections 918-928 of this title (articles

118-128), breaks and enters, in the nighttime, the dwelling house of another,

is guilty of burglary and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused unlawfully broke and entered the dwelling house

of another; 

(2) That both the breaking and entering were done in the nighttime;

and 

(3) That the breaking and entering were done with the intent to commit

an offense punishable under Article 118 through 128, except Article 123a.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

"Burglary" is the breaking and entering in the nighttime

of the dwelling house of another, with intent to commit an offense punishable

under Articles 118 through 128, except 123a. In addition, an intent to commit

an offense which, although not covered by Article 118 through 128, necessarily

includes an offense within one of these articles, satisfies the intent element

of this article. This includes, for example, assaults punishable under Article

134 which necessarily include simple assault under Article 128. 

### (2) Breaking.

There must be a breaking, actual or constructive. Merely to enter

 through a hole left in the wall or roof or through an open window or door

will not constitute a breaking; but if a person moves any obstruction to

 entry of the house without which movement the person could not have entered,

 the person has committed a "breaking." Opening a closed door

or window or other similar fixture, opening wider a door or window already

partly open but insufficient for the entry, or cutting out the glass of a

window or the netting of a screen is a sufficient breaking. The breaking

of an inner door by one who has entered the house without breaking, or by

a person lawfully within the house who has no authority to enter the particular

room, is a sufficient breaking, but unless such a breaking is followed by

an entry into the particular room with the requisite intent, burglary is

not committed. There is a constructive breaking when the entry is gained

by a trick, such as concealing oneself in a box; under false pretense, such

as impersonating a gas or telephone inspector; by intimidating the occupants

through violence or threats into opening the door; through collusion with

a confederate, an occupant of the house; or by descending a chimney, even

if only a partial descent is made and no room is entered. 

### (3) Entry.

An entry must be effected before the offense is complete, but the

 entry of any part of the body, even a finger, is sufficient. Insertion into

the house of a tool or other instrument is also a sufficient entry, unless

the insertion is solely to facilitate the breaking or entry. 

### (4) Nighttime.

Both the breaking and entry must be in the nighttime. "Nighttime"

is the period between sunset and sunrise when there is not sufficient daylight

to discern a person's face. 

### (5) Dwelling house of another.

To constitute burglary the house must be the dwelling house of

another. "Dwelling house" includes outbuildings within the common

inclosure, farmyard, or cluster of buildings used as a residence. Such an

area is the "curtilage." A store is not a dwelling house unless

part of, or also used as, a dwelling house, as when the occupant uses another

part of the same building as a dwelling, or when the store in habitually

slept in by family members or employees. The house must be used as a dwelling

at the time of the breaking and entering. It is not necessary that anyone

actually be in it at the time of the breaking and entering, but if the house

has never been occupied at all or has been left without any intention of

returning, it is not a dwelling house. Separate dwellings within the same

building, such as a barracks room, apartment, or a room in a hotel, are subjects

of burglary by other residents or guests, and in general by the owner of

the building. A tent is not a subject of burglary. 

### (6) Intent to commit offense.

Both the breaking and entry must be done with the intent to commit

in the house an offense punishable under Articles 118 through 128, except

123a. If, after the breaking and entering, the accused commits one or more

of these offenses, it may be inferred that the accused intended to commit

the offense or offenses at the time of the breaking and entering. If the

evidence warrants, the intended offense may be separately charged. It is

immaterial whether the offense intended is committed or even attempted. If

the offense is intended, it is no defense that its commission was impossible.

### (7) Separate offense.

If the evidence warrants, the intended offense in the burglary

specification may be separately charged. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

## f. Sample specification.

In that  (personal jurisdiction data),

did, at  , (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required),

on or about   20 , in the

nighttime, unlawfully break and enter the (dwelling house) (  within the curtilage) of  , with intent to

commit (murder) (larceny) (  ) therein. 

#  Article 130-Housebreaking

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who unlawfully enters

the building or structure of another with intent to commit a criminal offense

therein is guilty of housebreaking and shall be punished as a court-martial

may direct.**

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused unlawfully entered a certain building or structure

of a certain other person; and 

(2) That the unlawful entry was made with the intent to commit a criminal

offense therein. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Scope of offense.

The offense of housebreaking is broader than burglary in that the

place entered is not required to be a dwelling house; it is not necessary

that the place be occupied; it is not essential that there be a breaking;

the entry may be either in the night or in the daytime; and the intent need

not be to commit one of the offenses made punishable under Articles 118 through

128. 

### (2) Intent.

The intent to commit some criminal offense is an essential element

of housebreaking and must be alleged and proved to support a conviction of

this offense. If, after the entry the accused committed a criminal offense

inside the building or structure, it may be inferred that the accused intended

to commit that offense at the time of the entry. 

### (3) Criminal offense.

Any act or omission which is punishable by courts-martial, except

an act or omission constituting a purely military offense, is a "criminal

offense." 

### (4) Building, structure.

"Building" includes a room, shop, store, office, or

apartment in a building. "Structure" refers only to those structures

which are in the nature of a building or dwelling. Examples of these structures

are a stateroom, hold, or other compartment of a vessel, an inhabitable trailer,

 an inclosed truck or freight car, a tent, and a houseboat. It is not necessary

that the building or structure be in use at the time of the entry. 

### (5) Entry.

_See_ paragraph 55c(3). 

### (6) Separate offense.

If the evidence warrants, the intended offense in the housebreaking

specification may be separately charged. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years. 

## f. Sample specification.

 

  In that  , (personal jurisdiction data),

did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required),

on or about   20 , unlawfully

enter a (dwelling) (room) (bank) (store) (warehouse) (shop) (tent) (stateroom)

 (  ), the property of  , with

intent to commit a criminal offense, to wit:  , therein.

#  Article 131-Perjury

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any person subject to this chapter who in a judicial

proceeding or in a course of justice willfully and corruptly-** 

(1) **upon a lawful oath or in any form allowed by law to be substituted

for an oath, gives any false testimony material to the issue or matter of

inquiry; or** 

(2) **in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under

penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States

Code, subscribes any false statement material to the issue or matter of inquiry;

is guilty of perjury and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.**

## b. Elements.

### (1) Giving false testimony.

(a) That the accused took an oath or affirmation in a certain judicial

proceeding or course of justice; 

(b) That the oath or affirmation was administered to the accused in

a matter in which an oath or affirmation was required or authorized by law;

(c) That the oath or affirmation was administered by a person having

 authority to do so; 

(d) That upon the oath or affirmation that accused willfully gave certain

testimony; 

(e) That the testimony was material; 

(f) That the testimony was false; and 

(g) That the accused did not then believe the testimony to be true.

### (2) Subscribing false statement.

(a) That the accused subscribed a certain statement in a judicial proceeding

or course of justice; 

(b) That in the declaration, certification, verification, or statement

 under penalty of perjury, the accused declared, certified, verified, or

stated the truth of that certain statement; 

(c) That the accused willfully subscribed the statement; 

(d) That the statement was material; 

(e) That the statement was false; and 

(f) That the accused did not then believe the statement to be true.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

"Judicial proceeding" includes a trial by court-martial

and "course of justice" includes a preliminary hearing conducted under Article 32. If the accused is charged with having committed perjury before

 a court-martial, it must be shown that the court-martial was duly constituted.

### (2) Giving false testimony.

#### (a) Nature.

The testimony must be false and must be willfully and corruptly

given; that is, it must be proved that the accused gave the false testimony

willfully and did not believe it to be true. A witness may commit perjury

by testifying to the truth of a matter when in fact the witness knows nothing

about it at all or is not sure about it, whether the thing is true or false

in fact. A witness may also commit perjury in testifying falsely as to a

belief, remembrance, or impression, or as to a judgment or opinion. It is

no defense that the witness voluntarily appeared, that the witness was incompetent

as a witness, or that the testimony was given in response to questions that

the witness could have declined to answer. 

#### (b) Material matter.

The false testimony must be with respect to a material matter, but

that matter need not be the main issue in the case. Thus, perjury may be

committed by giving false testimony with respect to the credibility of a material

witness or in an affidavit in support of a request for a continuance, as well

as by giving false testimony with respect to a fact from which a legitimate

inference may be drawn as to the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue.

#### (c) Proof.

The falsity of the allegedly perjured statement cannot be proved

by circumstantial evidence alone, except with respect to matters which by

their nature are not susceptible of direct proof. The falsity of the statement

cannot be proved by the testimony of a single witness unless that testimony

directly contradicts the statement and is corroborated by other evidence

either direct or circumstantial, tending to prove the falsity of the statement.

However, documentary evidence directly disproving the truth of the statement

charged to have been perjured need not be corroborated if: the document is

an official record shown to have been well known to the accused at the time

the oath was taken; or the documentary evidence originated from the accused-or

had in any manner been recognized by the accused as containing the truth-before

 the allegedly perjured statement was made. 

#### (d) Oath.

The oath must be one recognized or authorized by law and must be

duly administered by one authorized to administer it. When a form of oath

has been prescribed, a literal following of that form is not essential; it

is sufficient if the oath administered conforms in substance to the prescribed

form. "Oath" includes an affirmation when the latter is authorized

in lieu of an oath. 

#### (e) Belief of accused.

The fact that the accused did not believe the statement to be true

may be proved by testimony of one witness without corroboration or by circumstantial

evidence. 

### (3) Subscribing false statement.

_See_ subparagraphs (1) and (2), above, as applicable.

Section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, provides for subscribing to

the truth of a document by signing it expressly subject to the penalty for

perjury. The signing must take place in a judicial proceeding or course of

justice-for example, if a witness signs under penalty of perjury summarized

testimony given at an Article 32 preliminary hearing. It is not required that the

document be sworn before a third party. Section 1746 does not change the requirement

 that a deposition be given under oath or alter the situation where an oath

is required to be taken before a specific person. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years. 

## f. Sample specifications.

### (5) Forgery of signature in connection with claims.

therein; 

(d) That the act was done with intent to defraud the United States;

and 

(e) That the property certified as being received was of a certain value.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Making a false or fraudulent claim.

#### (a) Claim.

A "claim" is a demand for a transfer of ownership of

money or property and does not include requisitions for the mere use of property.

This article applies only to claims against the United States or any officer

thereof as such, and not to claims against an officer of the United States

in that officer's private capacity. 

#### (b) Making a claim.

Making a claim is a distinct act from presenting it. A claim may

be made in one place and presented in another. The mere writing of a paper

in the form of a claim, without any further act to cause the paper to become

a demand against the United States or an officer thereof, does not constitute

making a claim. However, any act placing the claim in official channels constitutes

making a claim, even if that act does not amount to presenting a claim. It

is not necessary that the claim be allowed or paid or that it be made by

the person to be benefited by the allowance or payment. _See_ also

subparagraph (2), below. 

#### (c) Knowledge.

The claim must be made with knowledge of its fictitious or dishonest

character. This article does not proscribe claims, however groundless they

may be, that the maker believes to be valid, or claims that are merely made

negligently or without ordinary prudence. 

### (2) Presenting for approval or payment a false or fraudulent claim.

#### (a) False and fraudulent.

False and fraudulent claims include not only those containing some

material false statement, but also claims which the claimant knows to have

been paid or for some other reason the claimant knows the claimant is not

authorized to present or upon which the claimant knows the claimant has no

right to collect. 

#### (b) Presenting a claim.

The claim must be presented, directly or indirectly, to some person

having authority to pay it. The person to whom the claim is presented may

be identified by position or authority to approve the claim, and need not

be identified by name in the specification. A false claim may be tacitly presented,

as when a person who knows that there is no entitlement to certain pay accepts

it nevertheless without disclosing a disqualification, even though the person

may not have made any representation of entitlement to the pay. For example,

a person cashing a pay check which includes an amount for a dependency allowance,

knowing at the time that the entitlement no longer exists because of a change

in that dependency status, has tacitly presented a false claim. _See

also_ subparagraph (1), above. 

### (3) Making or using a false writing or other paper in connection with claims.

The false or fraudulent statement must be material, that is, it

must have a tendency to mislead governmental officials in their consideration

or investigation of the claim. The offense of making a writing or other paper

known to contain a false or fraudulent statement for the purpose of obtaining

the approval, allowance, or payment of a claim is complete when the writing

or paper is made for that purpose, whether or not any use of the paper has

been attempted and whether or not the claim has been presented. _See

also_ the explanation in subparagraph (1) and (2), above. 

### (4) False oath in connection with claims.

_See_ subparagraphs (1) and (2), above. 

### (5) Forgery of signature in connection with claims.

Any fraudulent making of the signature of another is forging or

counterfeiting, whether or not an attempt is made to imitate the handwriting. _

See_ paragraph 48(c) and subparagraph (1) and (2), above. 

### (6) Delivering less than amount called for by receipt.

It is immaterial by what means-whether deceit, collusion,

or otherwise-the accused effected the transaction, or what was the

accused's purpose. 

### (7) Making or delivering receipt without having full knowledge that it

is true.

When an officer or other person subject to military law is authorized

to make or deliver any paper certifying the receipt of any property of the

United States furnished or intended for the armed forces thereof, and a receipt

or other paper is presented for signature stating that a certain amount of

supplies has been furnished by a certain contractor, it is that person's

duty before signing the paper to know that the full amount of supplies therein

stated to have been furnished has in fact been furnished, and that the statements

 contained in the paper are true. If the person signs the paper with intent

to defraud the United States and without that knowledge, that person is guilty

of a violation of this section of the article. If the person signs the paper

with knowledge that the full amount was not received, it may be inferred that

the person intended to defraud the United States. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

(1) Article 132(1) and (2). Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all

pay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years.

#  Article 133-Conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman

## a. Text of statute.

 **Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who

is convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished

as a court-martial may direct.** 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused did or omitted to do certain acts; and 

(2) That, under the circumstances, these acts or omissions constituted

conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Gentleman.

As used in this article, "gentleman" includes both male

and female commissioned officers, cadets, and midshipmen. 

### (2) Nature of offense.

Conduct violative of this article is action or behavior in an official

capacity which, in dishonoring or disgracing the person as an officer, seriously

compromises the officer's character as a gentleman, or action or behavior

in an unofficial or private capacity which, in dishonoring or disgracing the

officer personally, seriously compromises the person's standing as an officer.

There are certain moral attributes common to the ideal officer and the perfect

gentleman, a lack of which is indicated by acts of dishonesty, unfair dealing,

 indecency, indecorum, lawlessness, injustice, or cruelty. Not everyone is

or can be expected to meet unrealistically high moral standards, but there

is a limit of tolerance based on customs of the service and military necessity

 below which the personal standards of an officer, cadet, or midshipman cannot

fall without seriously compromising the person's standing as an officer,

cadet, or midshipman or the person's character as a gentleman. This article

 prohibits conduct by a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman which,

taking all the circumstances into consideration, is thus compromising. This

article includes acts made punishable by any other article, provided these

acts amount to conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Thus, a commissioned

officer who steals property violates both this article and Article 121. Whenever

the offense charged is the same as a specific offense set forth in this Manual,

the elements of proof are the same as those set forth in the paragraph which

 treats that specific offense, with the additional requirement that the act

or omission constitutes conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman. 

### (3) Examples of offenses.

Instances of violation of this article include knowingly making

a false official statement; dishonorable failure to pay a debt; cheating

on an exam; opening and reading a letter of another without authority; using

insulting or defamatory language to another officer in that officer's presence

or about that officer to other military persons; being drunk and disorderly

in a public place; public association with known prostitutes; committing

or attempting to commit a crime involving moral turpitude; and failing without

good cause to support the officer's family. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement

for a period not in excess of that authorized for the most analogous offense

for which a punishment is prescribed in this Manual, or, if none is prescribed,

for 1 year. 

## f. Sample specifications.

### (1) Copying or using examination paper.

In that  (personal jurisdiction data),

did, (at/on board-location), on or about  20  , while undergoing a written examination on the subject

of  , wrongfully and dishonorably (receive) (request)

unauthorized aid by ((using) (copying) the examination paper of

 )) (  ). 

### (2) Drunk or disorderly.

 

In that  (personal jurisdiction data),

was, (at/on board-location), on or about  20  , in a public place, to wit:  ,

(drunk) (disorderly) (drunk and disorderly) while in uniform, to the disgrace

of the armed forces. 

#  Article 134-General article

## a. Text of statute.

 **Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter,

all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline

in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the

 armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject

to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general,

special, or summary court-martial, according to the nature and degree of

the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court.**

## b. Elements.

The proof required for conviction of an offense under Article 134 depends upon the nature of the misconduct charged. If the conduct is punished as a crime or offense not capital, the proof must establish every element of the crime or offense as required by the applicable law. All offenses under Article 134 require proof of a single terminal element; however, the terminal element may be proven using any of three theories of liability corresponding to clause 1, 2, or 3 offenses.

##  Discussion

 The terminal element is merely the expression of one of the clauses under Article 134. See paragraph c below for an explanation of the clauses and rules for drafting specifications. More than one clause may be alleged and proven; however, proof of only one clause will satisfy the terminal element. For clause 3 offenses, the military judge may judicially notice whether an offense is capital. _See_ Mil. R. Evid. 202.

(1) For clause 1 or 2 offenses under Article 134, the following proof is required:

(a) That the accused did or failed to do certain acts; and

(b) That, under the circumstances, the accused's conduct was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

(2) For clause 3 offenses under Article 134, the following proof is required: 

(a) That the accused did or failed to do certain acts that satisfy each element of the federal statute (including, in the case of a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 13, each element of the assimilated State, Territory, Possession, or District law); and  

(b) That the offense charged was an offense not capital.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

Article 134 makes punishable acts in three categories of offenses

not specifically covered in any other article of the code. These are referred

to as "clauses 1, 2, and 3" of Article 134. Clause 1 offenses

involve disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline

in the armed forces. Clause 2 offenses involve conduct of a nature to bring

discredit upon the armed forces. Clause 3 offenses involve noncapital crimes

or offenses which violate Federal law including law made applicable through

the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act, _see_ subsection (4)

below. If any conduct of this nature is specifically made punishable by

another article of the code, it must be charged as a violation of that article. _

See_ subparagraph (5)(a) below. However, _see_ paragraph

59_c_ for offenses committed by commissioned officers, cadets,

and midshipmen. 

### (2) Disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline

in the armed forces (clause 1).

#### (a) To the prejudice of good order and discipline.

"To the prejudice of good order and discipline" refers

 only to acts directly prejudicial to good order and discipline and not to

acts which are prejudicial only in a remote or indirect sense. Almost any

irregular or improper act on the part of a member of the military service

 could be regarded as prejudicial in some indirect or remote sense; however,

this article does not include these distant effects. It is confined to cases

in which the prejudice is reasonably direct and palpable. An act in violation

of a local civil law or of a foreign law may be punished if it constitutes

a disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the

armed forces. However, _see_ R.C.M. 203 concerning subject-matter

jurisdiction. 

#### (b) Breach of custom of the service.

A breach of a custom of the service may result in a violation of

 clause 1 of Article 134. In its legal sense, "custom" means

more than a method of procedure or a mode of conduct or behavior which is

merely of frequent or usual occurrence. Custom arises out of long established

 practices which by common usage have attained the force of law in the military

or other community affected by them. No custom may be contrary to existing

law or regulation. A custom which has not been adopted by existing statute

or regulation ceases to exist when its observance has been generally abandoned.

Many customs of the service are now set forth in regulations of the various

armed forces. Violations of these customs should be charged under Article

92 as violations of the regulations in which they appear if the regulation

is punitive. _ See_ paragraph 16c. 

### (3) Conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces (clause

2).

"Discredit" means to injure the reputation of. This

 clause of Article 134 makes punishable conduct which has a tendency to bring

the service into disrepute or which tends to lower it in public esteem.

Acts in violation of a local civil law or a foreign law may be punished if

 they are of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. However, _

see_ R.C.M. 203 concerning subject-matter jurisdiction. 

### (4) Crimes and offenses not capital (clause 3).

#### (a) In general.

State and foreign laws are not included within the crimes and offenses

not capital referred to in this clause of Article 134 and violations thereof

may not be prosecuted as such except when State law becomes Federal law

of local application under section 13 of title 18 of the United States Code

(Federal Assimilative Crimes Act- _see_ subparagraph

(4)(c) below). For the purpose of court-martial jurisdiction, the laws which

may be applied under clause 3 of Article 134 are divided into two groups:

crimes and offenses of unlimited application (crimes which are punishable

regardless where they may be committed), and crimes and offenses of local

application (crimes which are punishable only if committed in areas of federal

jurisdiction). 

#### (b) Crimes and offenses of unlimited application.

Certain noncapital crimes and offenses prohibited by the United

States Code are made applicable under clause 3 of Article 134 to all persons

subject to the code regardless where the wrongful act or omission occurred.

Examples include: counterfeiting (18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 471), and various frauds

against the Government not covered by Article 132. 

#### (c) Crimes and offenses of local application.

##### (i) In general.

A person subject to the code may not be punished under clause 3

of Article 134 for an offense that occurred in a place where the law in question

did not apply. For example, a person may not be punished under clause 3 of

Article 134 when the act occurred in a foreign country merely because that

act would have been an offense under the United States Code had the act occurred

in the United States. Regardless where committed, such an act might be punishable

under clauses 1 or 2 of Article 134. There are two types of congressional

enactments of local application: specific federal statutes (defining particular

crimes), and a general federal statute, the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act

(which adopts certain state criminal laws). 

##### (ii) Federal Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 13).

The Federal Assimilative Crimes Act is an adoption by Congress of

state criminal laws for areas of exclusive or concurrent federal jurisdiction,

provided federal criminal law, including the UCMJ, has not defined an applicable

offense for the misconduct committed. The Act applies to state laws validly

existing at the time of the offense without regard to when these laws were

enacted, whether before or after passage of the Act, and whether before or

after the acquisition of the land where the offense was committed. For example,

 if a person committed an act on a military installation in the United States

at a certain location over which the United States had either exclusive or

concurrent jurisdiction, and it was not an offense specifically defined by

federal law (including the UCMJ), that person could be punished for that act

by a court-martial if it was a violation of a noncapital offense under the

law of the State where the military installation was located. This is possible

because the Act adopts the criminal law of the state wherein the military

installation is located and applies it as though it were federal law. The

text of the Act is as follows: Whoever within or upon any of the places now

existing or hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section 7 of this

 title, is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable

by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted

within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession, or District in

 which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of

such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a

like punishment. 

### (5) Limitations on Article 134.

#### (a) Preemption doctrine.

The preemption doctrine prohibits application of Article 134 to

conduct covered by Articles 80 through 132. For example, larceny is covered

in Article 121, and if an element of that offense is lacking-for example,

intent-there can be no larceny or larceny-type offense, either under

Article 121 or, because of preemption, under Article 134. Article 134 cannot

be used to create a new kind of larceny offense, one without the required

intent, where Congress has already set the minimum requirements for such an

offense in Article 121. 

#### (b) Capital offense.

A capital offense may not be tried under Article 134. 

### (6) Drafting specifications for Article 134 offenses.

#### (a) Specifications under clause 1 or 2.

When alleging a clause 1 or 2 violation, the specification must expressly allege that the conduct was "to the prejudice of good order and discipline" or that it was "of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces." The same conduct may be prejudicial to good order and discipline in the armed forces and at the same time be of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. Both clauses may be alleged; however, only one must be proven to satisfy the terminal element. If conduct by an accused does not fall under any of the enumerated Article 134 offenses (paragraphs 61 through 113 of this Part), a specification not listed in this Manual may be used to allege the offense.

####  Discussion

 Clauses 1 and 2 are theories of liability that must be expressly alleged in a specification so that the accused will be given notice as to which clause or clauses to defend against. The words "to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces" encompass both paragraph c.(2)(a), prejudice to good order and discipline, and paragraph c.(2)(b), breach of custom of the Service. A generic sample specification is provided below:

 "_In that  , (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on board location), on or about _____ 20__, (commit elements of Article 134 clause 1 or 2 offense), and that said conduct (was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces) (and) (was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces)_."

 If clauses 1 and 2 are alleged together in the terminal element, the word "and" should be used to separate them. Any clause not proven beyond a reasonable doubt should be excepted from the specification at findings. See R.C.M. 918(a)(1). _See also_ Appendix 23 of this Manual, Art. 79. Although using the conjunctive "and" to connect the two theories of liability is recommended, a specification connecting the two theories with the disjunctive "or" is sufficient to provide the accused reasonable notice of the charge against him. _See_ Appendix 23 of this Manual, Art. 134.

####  Discussion

The first sentence in paragraph 60c(6)(a) above is inaccurate, as set forth in _United States v. Fosler_, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). _See also United States v. Ballan_, 71 M.J. 28 (C.A.A.F. 2012). Amending subparagraph (6)(a) requires an Executive Order, hence the strikethrough font. To state an offense under Article 134, practitioners should expressly allege at least one of the three terminal elements, i.e., that the alleged conduct was: prejudicial to good order and discipline; service discrediting; or a crime or offense not capital. _See Fosler_, 70 M.J. at 226 and R.C.M 307(c)(3).

_See also_ the analysis related to this paragraph in Appendix 23. For an explanation of clause 1, 2, and 3 offenses under Article 134, see paragraph 60c(1)-(4).

  A generic sample specification is provided below with the terminal element(s) for a clause 1 or 2 offense:

_"In that   , (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on

board-location), on or about (date), (commit elements of Article 134, clause 1 or 2, offense), and that said conduct was (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces) (or) (and was) (of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces)."_

  Lesser included offenses are defined and explained under Article 79; however, in 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces examined Article 79 and clarified the legal test for lesser included offenses.

_See United States v. Jones_, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010). Under _Jones_, an offense under Article 79 is "necessarily included" in the offense charged only if the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the greater offense alleged. 68 M.J. at 472. _See also_ discussion following paragraph 3b(1)(c) in this part and the related analysis in Appendix 23 of this Manual. This change in the law has particularly broad impact on Article 134 offenses, and practitioners should carefully consider lesser included offenses using the elements test in conformity with _Jones_. _See_ paragraph 3b(4) in Appendix 23 of this Manual. If it is uncertain whether an Article 134 offense is included within a charged offense, the government may plead in the alternative, or with accused consent, the government may amend the charge sheet. _Jones_, 68 M.J. at 472-3 (referring to R.C.M. 603(d) for amending a charge sheet).

#### (b) Specifications under clause 3.

When alleging a clause 3 violation, the specification must expressly allege that the conduct was "an offense not capital," and each element of the federal statute (including, in the case of a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. --SECT-- 13, each element of the assimilated State, Territory, Possession, or District law) must be alleged expressly or by necessary implication. In addition, the federal statute should be identified.

####  Discussion

The words "an offense not capital" are sufficient to provide notice to the accused that a clause 3 offense has been charged and are meant to include all crimes and offenses not capital. A generic sample specification for clause 3 offenses is provided below:

 _In that _______, (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on board location), on or about _____ 20__, (commit: address each element), an offense not capital, in violation of (name or citation of statute)_.

In addition to alleging each element of the federal statute, practitioners should consider including, when appropriate and necessary, words of criminality (_e.g._, wrongfully, knowingly, or willfully).

#  Article 134-(Animal Abuse)

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

### (1) Abuse, neglect, or abandonment of an animal.

(a) That the accused wrongfully abused, neglected, or abandoned a certain (public*) animal (and the accused caused the serious injury or death of the animal*); and

(b) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

 (*Note:  Add these elements as applicable.)

### (2) Sexual act with an animal. 

(a) That the accused engaged in a sexual act with a certain animal; and

(b) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

 This offense prohibits knowing, reckless, or negligent abuse, neglect, or abandonment of an animal. This offense does not include legal hunting, trapping, or fishing; reasonable and recognized acts of training, handling, or disciplining of an animal; normal and accepted farm or veterinary practices; research or testing conducted in accordance with approved military protocols; protection of person or property from an unconfined animal; or authorized military operations or military training.

Abuse may include any sexual touching of an animal if not included in the definition of "sexual act with an animal" below.

(B) "Neglect" means allowing another to abuse an animal, or, having the charge or custody of any animal, intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently failing to provide it with proper food, drink, or protection from the weather consistent with the species, breed, and type of animal involved.

#  Article 134-(Adultery)

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused wrongfully had sexual intercourse with a certain

person; 

(2) That, at the time, the accused or the other person was married to

someone else; and 

(3) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Nature of offense.

Adultery is clearly unacceptable conduct, and it reflects adversely

on the service record of the military member. 

### (2) Conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline or of a nature to

bring discredit upon the armed forces.

To constitute an offense under the UCMJ, the adulterous conduct

must either be directly prejudicial to good order and discipline or service

discrediting. Adulterous conduct that is directly prejudicial includes conduct

 that has an obvious, and measurably divisive effect on unit or organization

 discipline, morale, or cohesion, or is clearly detrimental to the authority

or stature of or respect toward a servicemember. Adultery may also be service

 discrediting, even though the conduct is only indirectly or remotely prejudicial

to good order and discipline. Discredit means to injure the reputation of

the armed forces and includes adulterous conduct that has a tendency, because

of its open or notorious nature, to bring the service into disrepute, make

it subject to public ridicule, or lower it in public esteem. While adulterous

conduct that is private and discreet in nature may not be service discrediting

by this standard, under the circumstances, it may be determined to be conduct

prejudicial to good order and discipline. Commanders should consider all

relevant circumstances, including but not limited to the following factors,

when determining whether adulterous acts are prejudicial to good order and

discipline or are of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces:

(a) The accused's marital status, military rank, grade, or position;

 

(b)  The co-actor's marital status, military rank, grade, and position,

or relationship to the armed forces; 

(c) The military status of the accused's spouse or the spouse of co-actor,

or their relationship to the armed forces; 

(d) The impact, if any, of the adulterous relationship on the ability

of the accused, the co-actor, or the spouse of either to perform their duties

in support of the armed forces; 

(e) The misuse, if any, of government time and resources to facilitate

the commission of the conduct; 

(f) Whether the conduct persisted despite counseling or orders to desist;

the flagrancy of the conduct, such as whether any notoriety ensued; and whether

the adulterous act was accompanied by other violations of the UCMJ; 

(g) The negative impact of the conduct on the units or organizations

of the accused, the co-actor or the spouse of either of them, such as a detrimental

effect on unit or organization morale, teamwork, and efficiency; 

(h)  Whether the accused or co-actor was legally separated; and 

(i)  Whether the adulterous misconduct involves an ongoing or recent

relationship or is remote in time. 

### (3) Marriage.

A marriage exists until it is dissolved in accordance with the laws

of a competent state or foreign jurisdiction. 

### (4) Mistake of fact.

A defense of mistake of fact exists if the accused had an honest

and reasonable belief either that the accused and the co-actor were both

unmarried, or that they were lawfully married to each other. If this defense

 is raised by the evidence, then the burden of proof is upon the United States

to establish that the accused's belief was unreasonable or not honest. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 1 year. 

## f. Sample specification.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction data),

(a married man/a married woman), did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter

jurisdiction data, if required), on or about  20

  , wrongfully have sexual intercourse with

  , a (married) (woman/man) not (his wife) (her husband), and that said conduct was (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces) (of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces) (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces and was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces). 

#  Deleted-See Appendix 27

Indecent assault was deleted by Executive Order 13447, 72 Fed. Reg. 56179

(Oct. 2, 2007). _See_ Appendix 25.

#  Article 134-(Assault-with intent to commit murder, voluntary

manslaughter, rape, robbery, forcible sodomy, arson, burglary, or housebreaking)

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused assaulted a certain person; 

(2) That, at the time of the assault, the accused intended to kill (as

required for murder or voluntary manslaughter) or intended to commit rape,

robbery, forcible sodomy, arson, burglary, or housebreaking; and 

(3) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

An assault with intent to commit any of the offenses mentioned above

is not necessarily the equivalent of an attempt to commit the intended offense,

for an assault can be committed with intent to commit an offense without

achieving that proximity to consummation of an intended offense which is essential

to an attempt. _See_ paragraph 4. 

### (2) Assault with intent to murder.

Assault with intent to commit murder is assault with specific intent

to kill. Actual infliction of injury is not necessary. To constitute an assault

with intent to murder with a firearm, it is not necessary that the weapon

be discharged. When the intent to kill exists, the fact that for some unknown

reason the actual consummation of the murder by the means employed is impossible

is not a defense if the means are apparently adapted to the end in view.

The intent to kill need not be directed against the person assaulted if the

 assault is committed with intent to kill some person. For example, if a person,

intending to kill Jones, shoots Smith, mistaking Smith for Jones, that person

is guilty of assaulting Smith with intent to murder. If a person fires into

a group with intent to kill anyone in the group, that person is guilty of

and assault with intent to murder each member of the group. 

### (3) Assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter.

Assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter is an assault

committed with a specific intent to kill under such circumstances that, if

death resulted therefrom, the offense of voluntary manslaughter would have

been committed. There can be no assault with intent to commit involuntary

manslaughter, for it is not a crime capable of being intentionally committed.

### (4) Assault with intent to commit rape.

In assault with intent to commit rape, the accused must have intended to complete the offense. Any lesser intent will not suffice. No actual touching is necessary, but indecent advances

and importunities, however earnest, not accompanied by such an intent, do

not constitute this offense, nor do mere preparations to rape not amounting

to an assault. Once an assault with intent to commit rape is made, it is

no defense that the accused voluntarily desisted. 

### (5) Assault with intent to rob.

For assault with intent to rob, the fact that the accused intended

to take money and that the person the accused intended to rob had none is

not a defense. 

### (6) Assault with intent to commit forcible sodomy.

Assault with intent to commit forcible sodomy is an assault against a human

being and must be committed with a specific intent to commit forcible sodomy. Any

lesser intent, or different intent, will not suffice. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Assault with intent to commit murder or rape.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 20 years. 

### (2) Assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter, robbery, forcible sodomy,

arson, or burglary.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

confinement for 10 years. 

### (3) Assault with intent to commit housebreaking.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years.

#  Article 134-(Bigamy)

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused had a living lawful spouse; 

(2) That while having such spouse the accused wrongfully married another

 person; and 

(3) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

Bigamy is contracting another marriage by one who already has a

 living lawful spouse. If a prior marriage was void, it will have created

no status of "lawful spouse." However, if it was only voidable

and has not been voided by a competent court, this is no defense. A belief

that a prior marriage has been terminated by divorce, death of the other

spouse, or otherwise, constitutes a defense only if the belief was reasonable. _

See_ R.C.M. 916(j)(1). 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 2 years.

(a) That the accused wrongfully asked, accepted, or received a thing

of value from a certain person or organization; 

(b) That the accused then occupied a certain official position or had

 certain official duties; 

(c) That the accused asked, accepted, or received this thing of value

 (with the intent to have the accused's decision or action influenced with

respect to a certain matter)* (as compensation for or in recognition of

services rendered, to be rendered, or both, by the accused in relation to

a certain matter)**; 

(d) That this certain matter was an official matter in which the United

 States was and is interested; and 

(e) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

### (2) Promising, offering, or giving.

(a) That the accused wrongfully promised, offered, or gave a thing of

 value to a certain person; 

(b) That this person then occupied a certain official position or had

 certain official duties;

Bribery requires an intent to influence or be influenced in an

official matter; graft does not. Graft involves compensation for services

 performed in an official matter when no compensation is due. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

#  Article 134-(Burning with intent to defraud)

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused willfully and maliciously burned or set fire to

 certain property owned by a certain person or organization; 

(2) That such burning or setting on fire was with the intent to defraud

a certain person or organization; and 

(3) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

 _See_ paragraph 49c(14) for a discussion of "intent

to defraud." 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 10 years. 

## f. Sample specification.

 

  In that  (personal jurisdiction data),

on or about   20 , willfully

and maliciously (burn) (set fire to) (a dwelling) (a barn) (an automobile),

#  Article 134-(Check, worthless, making and uttering-by

dishonorably failing to maintain funds)

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused made and uttered a certain check; 

(2) That the check was made and uttered for the purchase of a certain

thing, in payment of a debt, or for a certain purpose; 

(3) That the accused subsequently failed to place or maintain sufficient

funds in or credit with the drawee bank for payment of the check in full

upon its presentment for payment; 

(4) That this failure was dishonorable; and 

(5) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

This offense differs from an Article 123a offense (paragraph 49)

in that there need be no intent to defraud or deceive at the time of making,

drawing, uttering, or delivery, and that the accused need not know at that

time that the accused did not or would not have sufficient funds for payment.

The gist of the offense lies in the conduct of the accused after uttering

the instrument. Mere negligence in maintaining one's bank balance is insufficient

for this offense, for the accused's conduct must reflect bad faith or gross

indifference in this regard. As in the offense of dishonorable failure to

pay debts (_see_ paragraph 71), dishonorable conduct of the

accused is necessary, and the other principles discussed in paragraph 71 also

apply here. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

confinement for 6 months.

utter to  a certain check, in words and figures as

follows, to wit:  , (for the purchase of   ) (in payment of a debt) (for the purpose of  ),

and did thereafter dishonorably fail to (place) (maintain) sufficient funds

in the  Bank for payment of such check in full upon

its presentment for payment, and that said conduct was (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces) (of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces) (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces and was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces). 

#  Article 134-(Child endangerment)

## a. Text of statute.

See paragraph 60.

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused had a duty for the care of a certain child;

(2) That the child was under the age of 16 years;

(3) That the accused endangered the child's mental or physical health, safety, or welfare through design or culpable negligence; and

(4) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

This offense is intended to prohibit and therefore deter child endangerment through design or culpable negligence.

### (2) Design.

Design means on purpose, intentionally, or according to plan and requires specific intent to endanger the child.

### (3) Culpable negligence.

Culpable negligence is a degree of carelessness greater than simple negligence. It is a negligent act or omission accompanied by a culpable disregard for the foreseeable consequences to others of that act or omission. In the context of this offense, culpable negligence may include acts that, when viewed in the light of human experience, might foreseeably result in harm to a child, even though such harm would not necessarily be the natural and probable consequences of such acts. In this regard, the age and maturity of the child, the conditions surrounding the neglectful conduct, the proximity of assistance available, the nature of the environment in which the child may have been left, the provisions made for care of the child, and the location of the parent or adult responsible for the child relative to the location of the child, among others, may be considered in determining whether the conduct constituted culpable negligence.

### (4) Harm.

 Actual physical or mental harm to the child is not required. The offense requires that the accused's actions reasonably could have caused physical or mental harm or suffering. However, if the accused's conduct does cause actual physical or mental harm, the potential maximum punishment increases.

See Paragraph 54c(4)(a)(iii) for an explanation of "grievous bodily harm".

### (5) Endanger.

"Endanger" means to subject one to a reasonable probability of harm.

### (6) Age of victim as a factor.

While this offense may be committed against any child under 16, the age of the victim is a factor in the culpable negligence determination.  Leaving a teenager alone for an evening may not be culpable (or even simple) negligence; leaving an infant or toddler for the same period might constitute culpable negligence. On the other hand, leaving a teenager without supervision for an extended period while the accused was on temporary duty outside commuting distance might constitute culpable negligence.

### (7) Duty required.

The duty of care is determined by the totality of the circumstances and may be established by statute, regulation, legal parent-child relationship, mutual agreement, or assumption of control or custody by affirmative act. When there is no duty of care of a child, there is no offense under this paragraph. Thus, there is no offense when a stranger makes no effort to feed a starving child or an individual/neighbor not charged with the care of a child does not prevent the child from running and playing in the street.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Endangerment by design resulting in grievous bodily harm.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 8 years.

#### (2) Endangerment by design resulting in harm.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 5 years.

##### (3) Other cases by design.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and

allowances and confinement for 4 years. 

###### (4) Endangerment by culpable negligence resulting in grievous bodily

 harm.

 Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 3 years.

####### (5) Endangerment by culpable negligence resulting in harm.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years.

######## (6) Other cases by culpable negligence.

 Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.

## f. Sample specification.

### (1) Resulting in grievous bodily harm.

#  Article 134-(Child pornography)

## a. Text of Statute. 

See paragraph 60.

## b. Elements. 

### (1) Possessing, receiving, or viewing child pornography.

(a) That the accused knowingly and wrongfully possessed, received, or viewed child pornography; and

(b) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

### (2) Possessing child pornography with intent to distribute.

(a) That the accused knowingly and wrongfully possessed child pornography; 

(b) That the possession was with the intent to distribute; and

(c) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

### (3) Distributing child pornography. 

(a) That the accused knowingly and wrongfully distributed child pornography to another; and 

(b) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

### (4) Producing child pornography.

(a) That the accused knowingly and wrongfully produced child pornography; and

(b) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

## c. Explanation. 

(1) "Child Pornography" means material that contains either an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct or a visual depiction of an actual minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

(2) An accused may not be convicted of possessing, receiving, viewing, distributing, or producing child pornography if he was not aware that the images were of minors, or what appeared to be minors, engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Awareness may be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the name of a computer file or folder, the name of the host website from which a visual depiction was viewed or received, search terms used, and the number of images possessed. 

(3) "Distributing" means delivering to the actual or constructive possession of another. 

(4) "Minor" means any person under the age of 18 years.

(5) "Possessing" means exercising control of something. Possession may be direct physical custody like holding an item in one's hand, or it may be constructive, as in the case of a person who hides something in a locker or a car to which that person may return to retrieve it. Possession must be knowing and conscious. Possession inherently includes the power or authority to preclude control by others. It is possible for more than one person to possess an item simultaneously, as when several people share control over an item. 

(6) "Producing" means creating or manufacturing. As used in this paragraph, it refers to making child pornography that did not previously exist. It does not include reproducing or copying.

(7) "Sexually explicit conduct" means actual or simulated:

(a) sexual intercourse or sodomy, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; 

(b) bestiality; 

(c) masturbation;

(d) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or

(e) lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.

(8) "Visual depiction" includes any developed or undeveloped photograph, picture, film or video; any digital or computer image, picture, film, or video made by any means, including those transmitted by any means including streaming media, even if not stored in a permanent format; or any digital or electronic data capable of conversion into a visual image. 

(9) "Wrongfulness." Any facts or circumstances that show that a visual depiction of child pornography was unintentionally or inadvertently acquired are relevant to wrongfulness, including, but not limited to, the method by which the visual depiction was acquired, the length of time the visual depiction was maintained, and whether the visual depiction was promptly, and in good faith, destroyed or reported to law enforcement.

(10) On motion of the government, in any prosecution under this paragraph, except for good cause shown, the name, address, social security number, or other nonphysical identifying information, other than the age or approximate age, of any minor who is depicted in any child pornography or visual depiction or copy thereof shall not be admissible and may be redacted from any otherwise admissible evidence, and the panel shall be instructed, upon request of the Government, that it can draw no inference from the absence of such evidence. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment. 

### (1) Possessing, receiving, or viewing child pornography.

(3) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

This offense differs from adultery (_see_ paragraph

 62) in that it is not necessary to prove that one of the partners was married

or that sexual intercourse took place. Public knowledge of the wrongfulness

of the relationship is not required, but the partners must behave in a manner,

as exhibited by conduct or language, that leads others to believe that a

marital relationship exists.

(b) That, while in such correctional custody, the accused was under

 physical restraint; 

(c) That the accused freed himself or herself from the physical restraint

 of this correctional custody before being released therefrom by proper authority;

and 

(d) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

### (2) Breach of correctional custody.

(a) That the accused was placed in correctional custody by a person

 authorized to do so; 

(b) That, while in correctional custody, a certain restraint was imposed

 upon the accused; 

(c) That the accused went beyond the limits of the restraint imposed

 before having been released from the correctional custody or relieved of

the restraint by proper authority; and 

(d) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Escape from correctional custody.

Escape from correctional custody is the act of a person undergoing

 the punishment of correctional custody pursuant to Article 15, who, before

being set at liberty by proper authority, casts off any physical restraint

imposed by the custodian or by the place or conditions of custody. 

### (2) Breach of correctional custody.

Breach of restraint during correctional custody is the act of a

 person undergoing the punishment who, in the absence of physical restraint

imposed by a custodian or by the place or conditions of custody, breaches

 any form of restraint imposed during this period. 

### (3) Authority to impose correctional custody.

 _See_ Part V concerning who may impose correctional

custody. Whether the status of a person authorized that person to impose

correctional custody is a question of law to be decided by the military

judge. Whether the person who imposed correctional custody had such a status

 is a question of fact to be decided by the factfinder. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

#  Article 134-(Debt, dishonorably failing to pay)

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused was indebted to a certain person or entity in a

 certain sum; 

(2) That this debt became due and payable on or about a certain date;

(3) That while the debt was still due and payable the accused dishonorably

failed to pay this debt; and 

(4) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

More than negligence in nonpayment is necessary. The failure to

pay must be characterized by deceit, evasion, false promises, or other distinctly

culpable circumstances indicating a deliberate nonpayment or grossly indifferent

attitude toward one's just obligations. For a debt to form the basis of this

offense, the accused must not have had a defense, or an equivalent offset

or counterclaim, either in fact or according to the accused's belief, at

the time alleged. The offense should not be charged if there was a genuine

dispute between the parties as to the facts or law relating to the debt which

would affect the obligation of the accused to pay. The offense is not committed

if the creditor or creditors involved are satisfied with the conduct of the

debtor with respect to payment. The length of the period of nonpayment and

any denial of indebtedness which the accused may have made may tend to prove

that the accused's conduct was dishonorable, but the court-martial may convict

only if it finds from all of the evidence that the conduct was in fact dishonorable.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

(5) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

or other agency that is a part of its administration.

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

The gist of this offense is a violation of the custom of the armed

 forces against fraternization. Not all contact or association between officers

and enlisted persons is an offense. Whether the contact or association in

question is an offense depends on the surrounding circumstances. Factors

to be considered include whether the conduct has compromised the chain of

command, resulted in the appearance of partiality, or otherwise undermined

good order, discipline, authority, or morale. The acts and circumstances

must be such as to lead a reasonable person experienced in the problems of

military leadership to conclude that the good order and discipline of the

armed forces has been prejudiced by their tendency to compromise the respect

of enlisted persons for the professionalism, integrity, and obligations of

an officer. 

### (2) Regulations.

Regulations, directives, and orders may also govern conduct between

 officer and enlisted personnel on both a service-wide and a local basis.

Relationships between enlisted persons of different ranks, or between officers

of different ranks may be similarly covered. Violations of such regulations,

directives, or orders may be punishable under Article 92. _See_ paragraph

16. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Nature of offense.

Negligent homicide is any unlawful homicide which is the result

of simple negligence. An intent to kill or injure is not required. 

### (2) Simple negligence.

Simple negligence is the absence of due care, that is, an act or

omission of a person who is under a duty to use due care which exhibits a

lack of that degree of care of the safety of others which a reasonably careful

person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances. Simple

negligence is a lesser degree of carelessness than culpable negligence. _

## c. Explanation.

"Indecent" language is that which is grossly offensive to

 modesty, decency, or propriety, or shocks the moral sense, because of its vulgar, filthy, or disgusting nature, or its tendency to incite lustful thought.

"In use by" means any vessel operated by or under the

control of the armed forces. This offense may be committed at sea, at anchor,

or in port. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

#  Article 134-(Kidnapping)

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, or carried

away a certain person; 

(2) That the accused then held such person against that person's will;

(3) That the accused did so willfully and wrongfully; and 

(4) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Inveigle, decoy.

"Inveigle" means to lure, lead astray, or entice by

false representations or other deceitful means. For example, a person who

entices another to ride in a car with a false promise to take the person

to a certain destination has inveigled the passenger into the car. "Decoy"

means to entice or lure by means of some fraud, trick, or temptation. For

example, one who lures a child into a trap with candy has decoyed the child.

### (2) Held.

"Held" means detained. The holding must be more than

a momentary or incidental detention. For example, a robber who holds the

victim at gunpoint while the victim hands over a wallet, or a rapist who

throws his victim to the ground, does not, by such acts, commit kidnapping.

On the other hand, if, before or after such robbery or rape, the victim is

involuntarily transported some substantial distance, as from a housing area

to a remote area of the base or post, this may be kidnapping, in addition

to robbery or rape. 

### (3) Against the will.

"Against that person's will" means that the victim was

held involuntarily. The involuntary nature of the detention may result from

force, mental or physical coercion, or from other means, including false

representations. If the victim is incapable of having a recognizable will,

as in the case of a very young child or a mentally incompetent person, the

holding must be against the will of the victim's parents or legal guardian.

Evidence of the availability or nonavailability to the victim of means of

exit or escape is relevant to the voluntariness of the detention, as is evidence

of threats or force, or lack thereof, by the accused to detain the victim.

### (4) Willfully.

The accused must have specifically intended to hold the victim

against the victim's will to be guilty of kidnapping. An accidental detention

will not suffice. The holding need not have been for financial or personal

gain or for any other particular purpose. It may be an aggravating circumstance

that the kidnapping was for ransom, however. _See_ R.C.M.

1001(b)(4). 

### (5) Wrongfully.

"Wrongfully" means without justification or excuse.

For example, a law enforcement official may justifiably apprehend and detain,

by force if necessary (_see_ R.C.M. 302(d)(3)), a person

reasonably believed to have committed an offense. An official who unlawfully

 uses the official's authority to apprehend someone is not guilty of kidnapping,

but may be guilty of unlawful detention. _See_ paragraph

21. It is not wrongful under this paragraph and therefore not kidnapping

for a parent or legal guardian to seize and hold that parent's or legal guardian's

minor child. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for life without eligibility for parole. 

## f. Sample specification.

### (2) Opening, secreting, destroying, or stealing.

(a) That the accused opened, secreted, destroyed, or stole certain mail

matter; 

(b) That such opening, secreting, destroying, or stealing was wrongful;

and 

(d) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

These offenses are intended to protect the mail and mail system.

 "Mail matter" means any matter deposited in a postal system

of any government or any authorized depository thereof or in official mail

channels of the United States or an agency thereof including the armed forces.

 certain matter for mailing and delivery; 

(2) That the act was done wrongfully and knowingly; 

(3) That the matter was obscene; and 

(4) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

Whether something is obscene is a question of fact. "Obscene"

is synonymous with "indecent" as the latter is defined in paragraph

89c. The matter must violate community standards of decency or obscenity

and must go beyond customary limits of expression. "Knowingly"

means the accused deposited the material with knowledge of its nature. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

 confinement for 5 years.

(4) That the concealing was wrongful; and 

(5) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

Misprision of a serious offense is the offense of concealing a

serious offense committed by another but without such previous concert with

or subsequent assistance to the principal as would make the accused an accessory. _

See_ paragraph 3. An intent to benefit the principal is not necessary

to this offense. 

### (2) Serious offense.

For purposes of this paragraph, a "serious offense"

is any offense punishable under the authority of the code by death or by

confinement for a term exceeding 1 year. 

### (3) Positive act of concealment.

A mere failure or refusal to disclose the serious offense without

 some positive act of concealment does not make one guilty of this offense.

Making a false entry in an account book for the purpose of concealing a

theft committed by another is an example of a positive act of concealment.

## d. Lesser included offenses.

## a. Text of statute.

_See_ paragraph 60. 

## b. Elements.

(1) That the accused did engage in conduct; 

(2) That the conduct was wrongful and reckless or wanton; 

(3) That the conduct was likely to produce death or grievous bodily

harm to another person; and 

(4) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) In general.

This offense is intended to prohibit and therefore deter reckless

or wanton conduct that wrongfully creates a substantial risk of death or grievous

bodily harm to others.

### (2) Wrongfulness.

Conduct is wrongful when it is without legal justification or excuse.

### (3) Recklessness.

"Reckless" conduct is conduct that exhibits a culpable

disregard of foreseeable consequences to others from the act or omission

involved. The accused need not intentionally cause a resulting harm or know

that his conduct is substantially certain to cause that result. The ultimate

question is whether, under all the circumstances, the accused's conduct was

of that heedless nature that made it actually or imminently dangerous to

the rights or safety of others. 

### (4) Wantonness.

"Wanton" includes "Reckless" but may connote

willfulness, or a disregard of probable consequences, and thus describe a

more aggravated offense. 

### (5) Likely to produce.

When the natural or probable consequence of particular conduct would

be death or grievous bodily harm, it may be inferred that the conduct is

"likely" to produce that result. _See_ paragraph

 54c(4)(a)(ii). 

### (6) Grievous bodily harm.

"Grievous bodily harm" means serious bodily injury.

It does not include minor injuries, such as a black eye or a bloody nose,

but does include fractured or dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members of

the body, serious damage to internal organs, and other serious bodily injuries.

### (7) Death or injury not required.

It is not necessary that death or grievous bodily harm be actually

 inflicted to prove reckless endangerment. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

None. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and

confinement for 1 year. 

## f. Sample specification.

  In that  (personal jurisdiction

data), did, (at/on board-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data,

if required), on or about   20 ,

wrongfully and (recklessly) (wantonly) engage in conduct, to wit: (describe

conduct), conduct likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to  , and that said conduct was (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces) (of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces) (to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces and was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces).

the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of

a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.

directing a person to remain within certain specified limits. "Restriction"

includes restriction under R.C.M. 304(a)(2), restriction

(3) That the offense was committed (in time of war) (in a hostile fire

 pay zone). 

## c. Explanation.

### (1) Nature of offense.

This offense differs from malingering (see paragraph 40) in that

for this offense, the accused need not have harbored a design to avoid performance

 of any work, duty, or service which may properly or normally be expected

of one in the military service. This offense is characterized by intentional

self-injury under such circumstances as prejudice good order and discipline

or discredit the armed forces. It is not required that the accused be unable

to perform duties, or that the accused actually be absent from his or her

place of duty as a result of the injury. For example, the accused may inflict

the injury while on leave or pass. The circumstances and extent of injury,

however, are relevant to a determination that the accused's conduct was prejudicial

to good order and discipline, or service-discrediting. 

### (2) How injury inflicted. 

The injury may be inflicted by nonviolent as well as by violent

means and may be accomplished by any act or omission that produces, prolongs,

or aggravates a sickness or disability. Thus, voluntary starvation that

results in a debility is a self-inflicted injury. Similarly, the injury may

be inflicted by another at the accused's request. 

## d. Lesser included offenses.

See paragraph 3 of this part and Appendix 12A. 

## e. Maximum punishment.

### (1) Intentional self-inflicted injury.
