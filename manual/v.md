NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT PROCEDUREGeneralAuthority.Nonjudicial punishment in the United States Armed Forces is authorizedby Article 15.Nature.Nonjudicial punishment is a disciplinary measure more serious than the administrative corrective measures discussed in paragraph 1g, but less serious than trial by court-martial.Purpose.Nonjudicial punishment provides commanders with an essential and prompt means of maintaining good order and discipline and also promotespositive behavior changes in servicemembers without the stigma of a court-martialconviction.Policy.Commander's responsibility.Commanders are responsible for good order and discipline in their commands. Generally, discipline can be maintained through effective leadership including, when necessary, administrative corrective measures. Nonjudicial punishment is ordinarily appropriate when administrative corrective measures are inadequate due to the nature of the minor offense or the record of the servicemember, unless it is clear that only trial by court-martial will meet the needs of justice and discipline. Nonjudicial punishment shall be considered on an individual basis. Commanders considering nonjudicial punishment should consider the nature of the offense, the record of the servicemember, theneeds for good order and discipline, and the effect of nonjudicial punishmenton the servicemember and the servicemember's record.Commander's discretion.A commander who is considering a case for disposition under Article 15 will exercise personal discretion in evaluating each case, both as to whether nonjudicial punishment is appropriate, and, if so, as to the natureand amount of punishment appropriate. No superior may direct that a subordinate authority impose nonjudicial punishment in a particular case, issue regulations,orders, or "guides" which suggest to subordinate authoritiesthat certain categories of minor offenses be disposed of by nonjudicial punishmentinstead of by court-martial or administrative corrective measures, or thatpredetermined kinds or amounts of punishments be imposed for certain classificationsof offenses that the subordinate considers appropriate for disposition bynonjudicial punishment.Commander's suspension authority.Commanders should consider suspending all or part of any punishment selected under Article 15, particularly in the case of first offenders orwhen significant extenuating or mitigating matters are present. Suspensionprovides an incentive to the offender and gives an opportunity to the commanderto evaluate the offender during the period of suspension.Minor offenses.Nonjudicial punishment may be imposed for acts or omissions thatare minor offenses under the punitive articles (_see_ PartIV). Whether an offense is minor depends on several factors: the nature ofthe offense and the circumstances surrounding its commission; the offender'sage, rank, duty assignment, record and experience; and the maximum sentence imposable for the offense if tried by general court-martial. Ordinarily,a minor offense is an offense which the maximum sentence imposable wouldnot include a dishonorable discharge or confinement for longer than 1 yearif tried by general court-martial. The decision whether an offense is "minor"is a matter of discretion for the commander imposing nonjudicial punishment,but nonjudicial punishment for an offense other than a minor offense (eventhough thought by the commander to be minor) is not a bar to trial by court-martialfor the same offense. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(D)(iv). However,the accused may show at trial that nonjudicial punishment was imposed, andif the accused does so, this fact must be considered in determining an appropriatesentence. _See_ Article 15(f); R.C.M. 1001(c)(1)(B).Limitations on nonjudicial punishment.Double punishment prohibited.When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense, punishmentmay not again be imposed for the same offense under Article 15._ Butsee_ paragraph 1e concerning trial by court-martial.Increase in punishment prohibited. Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may not be increased,upon appeal or otherwise.Multiple punishment prohibited.When a commander determines that nonjudicial punishment is appropriatefor a particular servicemember, all known offenses determined to be appropriatefor disposition by nonjudicial punishment and ready to be considered at thattime, including all such offenses arising from a single incident or courseof conduct, shall ordinarily be considered together, and not made the basisfor multiple punishments.Statute of limitations.Except as provided in Article 43(d), nonjudicial punishment maynot be imposed for offenses which were committed more than 2 years beforethe date of imposition._ See_ Article 43(c).Civilian courts.Nonjudicial punishment may not be imposed for an offense tried bya court which derives its authority from the United States. Nonjudicialpunishment may not be imposed for an offense tried by a State or foreign court unless authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned.Relationship of nonjudicial punishment to administrative corrective measures.Article 15 and Part V of this Manual do not apply to include, or limit use of administrative corrective measures that promote efficiency and good order and discipline such as counseling, admonitions, reprimands, exhortations,disapprovals, criticisms, censures, reproofs, rebukes, extra military instruction,and administrative withholding of privileges._ See also_ R.C.M.306. Administrative corrective measures are not punishment, and they maybe used for acts or omissions which are not offenses under the code and foracts or omissions which are offenses under the code.Applicable standards.Unless otherwise provided, the service regulations and procedures of the service member shall apply.Effect of errors.Failure to comply with any of the procedural provisions of PartV of this Manual shall not invalidate a punishment imposed under Article15, unless the error materially prejudiced a substantial right of the servicememberon whom the punishment was imposed.Who may impose nonjudicial punishmentThe following persons may serve as a nonjudicial punishment authority for the purposes of administering nonjudicial punishment proceedings underthis Part:Commander.As provided by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a commander may impose nonjudicial punishment upon any military personnelof that command. "Commander" means a commissioned or warrant officer who, by virtue of rank and assignment, exercises primary command authorityover a military organization or prescribed territorial area, which underpertinent official directives is recognized as a "command." "Commander" includes a commander of a joint command. Subjectto subparagraph 1d(2) and any regulations of the Secretary concerned, the authority of a commander to impose nonjudicial punishment as to certain types of offenses, certain categories of persons, or in specific cases, or to impose certain types of punishment, may be limited or withheld by a superior commander or by the Secretary concerned.Officer in charge.If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, an officer in charge may impose nonjudicial punishment upon enlisted persons assignedto that unit.Principal assistant.If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a commander exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general orflag rank in command may delegate that commander's powers under Article 15to a principal assistant. The Secretary concerned may define "principal assistant."Right to demand trialExcept in the case of a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, punishment may not be imposed under Article 15 upon any member of the armed forces who has, before the imposition of nonjudicial punishment, demandedtrial by court-martial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment. This right mayalso be granted to a person attached to or embarked in a vessel if so authorizedby regulations of the Secretary concerned. A person is "attached to" or "embarked in" a vessel if, at the time nonjudicial punishmentis imposed, that person is assigned or attached to the vessel, is on boardfor passage, or is assigned or attached to an embarked staff, unit, detachment, squadron, team, air group, or other regularly organized body.ProcedureNotice.If, after a preliminary inquiry (_see_ R.C.M. 303), the nonjudicial punishment authority determines that disposition by nonjudicial punishment proceedings is appropriate (_see_ R.C.M. 306:paragraph 1 of this Part), the nonjudicial punishment authority shall causethe servicemember to be notified. The notice shall include:a statement that the nonjudicial punishment authority is considering the imposition of nonjudicial punishment;a statement describing the alleged offenses-including the article of the code-which the member is alleged to have committed;a brief summary of the information upon which the allegations are based or a statement that the member may, upon request, examine available statements and evidence;a statement of the rights that will be accorded to the servicemember under paragraphs 4c(1) and (2) of this Part;unless the right to demand trial is not applicable (_see_ paragraph 3 of this Part), a statement that the member may demand trial by court-martial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment, a statement ofthe maximum punishment which the nonjudicial punishment authority may imposeby nonjudicial punishment; a statement that, if trial by court-martial is demanded, charges could be referred for trial by summary, special, or general court-martial; that the member may not be tried by summary court-martialover the member's objection; and that at a special or general court-martialthe member has the right to be represented by counsel.Decision by servicemember.Demand for trial by court-martial.If the servicemember demands trial by court-martial (when this right is applicable), the nonjudicial proceedings shall be terminated. It is within the discretion of the commander whether to forward or refer charges for trial by court-martial (_see_ R.C.M. 306; 307; 401-407) insuch a case, but in no event may nonjudicial punishment be imposed for theoffenses affected unless the demand is voluntarily withdrawn.No demand for trial by court-martial.If the servicemember does not demand trial by court-martial withina reasonable time after notice under paragraph 4a of this Part, or if theright to demand trial by court-martial is not applicable, the nonjudicialpunishment authority may proceed under paragraph 4c of this Part.Nonjudicial punishment accepted.Personal appearance requested; procedure.Before nonjudicial punishment may be imposed, the servicemember shall be entitled to appear personally before the nonjudicial punishment authority who offered nonjudicial punishment, except when appearance isprevented by the unavailability of the nonjudicial punishment authority orby extraordinary circumstances, in which case the servicemember shall beentitled to appear before a person designated by the nonjudicial punishmentauthority who shall prepare a written summary of any proceedings before thatperson and forward it and any written matter submitted by the servicememberto the nonjudicial punishment authority. If the servicemember requests personal appearance, the servicemember shall be entitled to:Be informed in accordance with Article 31(b);Be accompanied by a spokesperson provided or arranged for by the member unless the punishment to be imposed will not exceed extra duty for14 days, restriction for 14 days, and an oral reprimand. Such a spokespersonneed not be qualified under R.C.M. 502(d); such spokesperson is not entitledto travel or similar expenses, and the proceedings need not be delayed topermit the presence of a spokesperson; the spokesperson may speak for the servicemember, but may not question witnesses except as the nonjudicialpunishment authority may allow as a matter of discretion;Be informed orally or in writing of the information against the servicemember and relating to the offenses alleged;Be allowed to examine documents or physical objects against the member which the nonjudicial punishment authority has examined in connection with the case and on which the nonjudicial punishment authority intends torely in deciding whether and how much nonjudicial punishment to impose;Present matters in defense, extenuation, and mitigation orally,or in writing, or both;Have present witnesses, including those adverse to the servicemember, upon request if their statements will be relevant and they are reasonably available. For purposes of this subparagraph, a witness is not reasonably available if the witness requires reimbursement by the United States forany cost incurred in appearing, cannot appear without unduly delaying the proceedings, or, if a military witness, cannot be excused from other important duties;Have the proceeding open to the public unless the nonjudicial punishmentauthority determines that the proceeding should be closed for good cause,such as military exigencies or security interests, or unless the punishmentto be imposed will not exceed extra duty for 14 days, restriction for 14days, and an oral reprimand; however, nothing in this subparagraph requiresspecial arrangements to be made to facilitate access to the proceeding.Personal appearance waived; procedure.Subject to the approval of the nonjudicial punishment authority,the servicemember may request not to appear personally under paragraph4c(1) of this Part. If such request is granted, the servicemember may submitwritten matters for consideration by the nonjudicial punishment authoritybefore such authority's decision under paragraph 4c(4) of this Part. Theservicemember shall be informed of the right to remain silent and that matterssubmitted may be used against the member in a trial by court-martial.Evidence.The Military Rules of Evidence (Part III), other than with respectto privileges, do not apply at nonjudicial punishment proceedings. Any relevant matter may be considered, after compliance with paragraphs 4c(1)(C) and(D) of this Part.Decision.After considering all relevant matters presented, if the nonjudicial punishment authority-Does not conclude that the servicemember committed the offenses alleged, the nonjudicial punishment authority shall so inform the memberand terminate the proceedings;Concludes that the servicemember committed one or more of the offensesalleged, the nonjudicial punishment authority shall:so inform the servicemember;inform the servicemember of the punishment imposed; andinform the servicemember of the right to appeal (_see_paragraph 7 of this Part).Nonjudicial punishment based on record of court of inquiry or other investigative body.Nonjudicial punishment may be based on the record of a court of inquiry or other investigative body, in which proceeding the member wasaccorded the rights of a party. No additional proceeding under paragraph 4c(1) of this Part is required. The servicemember shall be informed in writing that nonjudicial punishment is being considered based on the record of the proceedings in question, and given the opportunity, if applicable, to refuse nonjudicial punishment. If the servicemember does not demand trial by court-martialor has no option, the servicemember may submit, in writing, any matter indefense, extenuation, or mitigation, to the officer considering imposingnonjudicial punishment, for consideration by that officer to determine whetherthe member committed the offenses in question, and, if so, to determine anappropriate punishment.PunishmentsGeneral limitations.The Secretary concerned may limit the power granted by Article 15 with respect to the kind and amount of the punishment authorized. Subjectto paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Part and to regulations of the Secretary concerned, the kinds and amounts of punishment authorized by Article 15(b) may be imposed upon servicemembers as provided in this paragraph.Authorized maximum punishments.In addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, the following disciplinary punishments subject to the limitation of paragraph 5d of this Part, may be imposed upon servicemembers:Upon commissioned officers and warrant officers-By any commanding officer-restriction to specified limits,with or without suspension from duty for not more than 30 consecutive days;If imposed by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction,an officer of general or flag rank in command, or a principal assistant asdefined in paragraph 2c of this Part-arrest in quarters for not more than 30 consecutive days;forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month's pay per monthfor 2 months;restriction to specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days;Upon other military personnel of the command-By any nonjudicial punishment authority-if imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, confinementon bread and water or diminished rations for not more than 3 consecutivedays;correctional custody for not more than 7 consecutive days;forfeiture of not more than 7 days' pay;reduction to the next inferior grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction orany officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction;extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than14 consecutive days;restriction to specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 14 consecutive days;If imposed by a commanding officer of the grade of major or lieutenantcommander or above or a principal assistant as defined in paragraph 2c ofthis Part-if imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, confinementon bread and water or diminished rations for not more than 3 consecutivedays;correctional custody for not more than 30 consecutive days;forfeiture of not more than one-half of 1 month's pay per monthfor 2 months;reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but enlisted members in pay grades above E-4 may not be reduced more thanone pay grade, except that during time of war or national emergency thiscategory of persons may be reduced two grades if the Secretary concerneddetermines that circumstances require the removal of this limitation;extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than45 consecutive days;restriction to specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days.Nature of punishment.Admonition and reprimand.Admonition and reprimand are two forms of censure intended to express adverse reflection upon or criticism of a person's conduct. A reprimand isa more severe form of censure than an admonition. When imposed as nonjudicial punishment, the admonition or reprimand is considered to be punitive, unlike the nonpunitive admonition and reprimand provided for in paragraph 1g ofthis Part. In the case of commissioned officers and warrant officers, admonitions and reprimands given as nonjudicial punishment must be administered in writing. In other cases, unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, they may be administered either orally or in writing.Restriction.Restriction is the least severe form of deprivation of liberty. Restriction involves moral rather than physical restraint. The severity ofthis type of restraint depends on its duration and the geographical limitsspecified when the punishment is imposed. A person undergoing restrictionmay be required to report to a designated place at specified times if reasonablynecessary to ensure that the punishment is being properly executed. Unlessotherwise specified by the nonjudicial punishment authority, a person inrestriction may be required to perform any military duty.Arrest in quarters.As in the case of restriction, the restraint involved in arrestin quarters is enforced by a moral obligation rather than by physical means.This punishment may be imposed only on officers. An officer undergoing this punishment may be required to perform those duties prescribed by the Secretary concerned. However, an officer so punished is required to remain within that officer's quarters during the period of punishment unless the limits of arrest are otherwise extended by appropriate authority. The quarters of an officermay consist of a military residence, whether a tent, stateroom, or otherquarters assigned, or a private residence when government quarters have notbeen provided.Correctional custody.Correctional custody is the physical restraint of a person during duty or nonduty hours, or both, imposed as a punishment under Article 15,and may include extra duties, fatigue duties, or hard labor as an incidentof correctional custody. A person may be required to serve correctional custodyin a confinement facility, but if practicable, not in immediate associationwith persons awaiting trial or held in confinement pursuant to trial bycourt-martial. A person undergoing correctional custody may be required to perform those regular military duties, extra duties, fatigue duties, andhard labor which may be assigned by the authority charged with the administrationof the punishment. The conditions under which correctional custody is servedshall be prescribed by the Secretary concerned. In addition, the Secretaryconcerned may limit the categories of enlisted members upon whom correctionalcustody may be imposed. The authority competent to order the release of aperson from orrectional custody shall be as designated by the Secretaryconcerned.Confinement on bread and water or diminished rations.Confinement on bread and water or diminished rations involves confinementin places where the person so confined may communicate only with authorizedpersonnel. The ration to be furnished a person undergoing a punishment ofconfinement on bread and water or diminished rations is that specified bythe authority charged with the administration of the punishment, but theration may not consist solely of bread and water unless this punishment hasbeen specifically imposed. When punishment of confinement on bread and wateror diminished rations is imposed, a signed certificate of a medical officercontaining an opinion that no serious injury to the health of the personto be confined will be caused by that punishment, must be obtained beforethe punishment is executed. The categories of enlisted personnel upon whomthis type of punishment may be imposed may be limited by the Secretary concerned.Extra duties.Extra duties involve the performance of duties in addition to those normally assigned to the person undergoing the punishment. Extra duties may include fatigue duties. Military duties of any kind may be assigned as extra duty. However, no extra duty may be imposed which constitutes a known safetyor health hazard to the member or which constitutes cruel or unusual punishmentor which is not sanctioned by customs of the service concerned. Extra duties assigned as punishment of noncommissioned officers, petty officers, or any other enlisted persons of equivalent grades or positions designated by the Secretary concerned, should not be of a kind which demeans their grades or positions.Reduction in grade.Reduction in grade is one of the most severe forms of nonjudicial punishment and it should be used with discretion. As used in Article 15,the phrase "if the grade from which demoted is within the promotionauthority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinateto the one who imposes the reduction" does not refer to the authorityto promote the person concerned but to the general authority to promote tothe grade held by the person to be punished.Forfeiture of pay.Forfeiture means a permanent loss of entitlement to the pay forfeited."Pay," as used with respect to forfeiture of pay under Article15, refers to the basic pay of the person or, in the case of reserve componentpersonnel on inactive-duty, compensation for periods of inactive-duty training,plus any sea or hardship duty pay. "Basic pay" includes no elementof pay other than the basic pay fixed by statute for the grade and lengthof service of the person concerned and does not include special pay for aspecial qualification, incentive pay for the performance of hazardous duties, proficiency pay, subsistence and quarters allowances, and similar types of compensation. If the punishment includes both reduction, whether or notsuspended, and forfeiture of pay, the forfeiture must be based on the gradeto which reduced. The amount to be forfeited will be expressed in whole dollar amounts only and not in a number of day's pay or fractions of monthly pay.If the forfeiture is to be applied for more than 1 month, the amount to be forfeited per month and the number of months should be stated. Forfeitureof pay may not extend to any pay accrued before the date of its imposition.Limitations on combination of punishments.Arrest in quarters may not be imposed in combination with restriction;Confinement on bread and water or diminished rations may not be imposed in combination with correctional custody, extra duties, or restriction;Correctional custody may not be imposed in combination with restrictionor extra duties;Restriction and extra duties may be combined to run concurrently,but the combination may not exceed the maximum imposable for extra duties;Subject to the limits in subparagraphs d(1) through (4) all authorizedpunishments may be imposed in a single case in the maximum amounts.Punishments imposed on reserve component personnel while on inactive-dutytraining.When a punishment under Article 15 amounting to a deprivation of liberty (for example, restriction, correctional custody, extra duties, or arrest in quarters) is imposed on a member of a reserve component duringa period of inactive-duty training, the punishment may be served during oneor both of the following:a normal period of inactive-duty training; ora subsequent period of active duty (not including a period of active duty under Article 2(d)(1), unless such active duty was approved by theSecretary concerned).

Unserved punishments may be carried over to subsequentperiods of inactive-duty training or active duty. A sentence to forfeitureof pay may be collected from active duty and inactive-duty training pay duringsubsequent periods of duty.Punishments imposed on reserve component personnel when ordered to active duty for disciplinary purposes.When a punishment under Article 15 is imposed on a member of areserve component during a period of active duty to which the reservist was ordered pursuant to R.C.M. 204 and which constitutes a deprivation of liberty (for example, restriction, correctional custody, extra duties, or arrestin quarters), the punishment may be served during any or all of the following:that period of active duty to which the reservist was ordered pursuantto Article 2(d), but only where the order to active duty was approved bythe Secretary concerned;a subsequent normal period of inactive-duty training; ora subsequent period of active duty (not including a period of active duty pursuant to R.C.M. 204 which was not approved by the Secretary concerned).

Unservedpunishments may be carried over to subsequent periods of inactive-duty trainingor active duty. A sentence to forfeiture of pay may be collected from activeduty and inactive-duty training pay during subsequent periods of duty.Effective date and execution of punishments.Reduction and forfeiture of pay, if unsuspended, take effect onthe date the commander imposes the punishments. Other punishments, if unsuspended, will take effect and be carried into execution as prescribed by the Secretary concerned.Suspension, mitigation, remission, and setting asideSuspension.The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposes nonjudicial punishment,the commander who imposes nonjudicial punishment, or a successor in commandover the person punished, may, at any time, suspend any part or amount ofthe unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend a reduction in grade ora forfeiture, whether or not executed, subject to the following rules:An executed punishment of reduction or forfeiture of pay may be suspended only within a period of 4 months after the date of execution.Suspension of a punishment may not be for a period longer than 6 months from the date of the suspension, and the expiration of the current enlistment or term of service of the servicemember involved automatically terminates the period of suspension.Unless the suspension is sooner vacated, suspended portions of the punishment are remitted, without further action, upon the termination ofthe period of suspension.Unless otherwise stated, an action suspending a punishment includesa condition that the servicemember not violate any punitive article of thecode. The nonjudicial punishment authority may specify in writing additional conditions of the suspension.A suspension may be vacated by any nonjudicial punishment authority or commander competent to impose upon the servicemember concerned punishmentof the kind and amount involved in the vacation of suspension. Vacation of suspension may be based only on a violation of the conditions of suspension which occurs within the period of suspension. Before a suspension may be vacated, the servicemember ordinarily shall be notified and given an opportunityto respond. Although a hearing is not required to vacate a suspension, ifthe punishment is of the kind set forth in Article 15(e)(1)-(7), the servicemembershould, unless impracticable, be given an opportunity to appear before theofficer authorized to vacate suspension of the punishment to present anymatters in defense, extenuation, or mitigation of the violation on whichthe vacation action is to be based. Vacation of a suspended nonjudicial punishmentis not itself nonjudicial punishment, and additional action to impose nonjudicialpunishment for a violation of a punitive article of the code upon which thevacation action is based is not precluded thereby.Mitigation.Mitigation is a reduction in either the quantity or quality of a punishment, its general nature remaining the same. Mitigation is appropriate when the offender's later good conduct merits a reduction in the punishment,or when it is determined that the punishment imposed was disproportionate.The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposes nonjudicial punishment,the commander who imposes nonjudicial punishment, or a successor in commandmay, at any time, mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted portion ofthe punishment imposed. The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposes nonjudicial punishment, the commander who imposes nonjudicial punishment,or a successor in command may also mitigate reduction in grade, whether executedor unexecuted, to forfeiture of pay, but the amount of the forfeiture maynot be greater than the amount that could have been imposed by the officerwho initially imposed the nonjudicial punishment. Reduction in grade maybe mitigated to forfeiture of pay only within 4 months after the date of execution. 

 When mitigating-Arrest in quarters to restriction;Confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to correctional custody;Correctional custody or confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to extra duties or restriction, or both; orExtra duties to restriction, the mitigated punishment may not befor a greater period than the punishment mitigated. As restriction is theleast severe form of deprivation of liberty, it may not be mitigated to alesser period of another form of deprivation of liberty, as that would meanan increase in the quality of the punishment.Remission.Remission is an action whereby any portion of the unexecuted punishmentis cancelled. Remission is appropriate under the same circumstances as mitigation.The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposes punishment, the commanderwho imposes nonjudicial punishment, or a successor in command may, at anytime, remit any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the punishment imposed. The expiration of the current enlistment or term of service of the servicemember automatically remits any unexecuted punishment imposed under Article 15.Setting aside.Setting aside is an action whereby the punishment or any part or amount thereof, whether executed or unexecuted, is set aside and any property, privileges, or rights affected by the portion of the punishment set asideare restored. The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposed punishment,the commander who imposes nonjudicial punishment, or a successor in commandmay set aside punishment. The power to set aside punishments and restorerights, privileges, and property affected by the executed portion of a punishment should ordinarily be exercised only when the authority considering the case believes that, under all circumstances of the case, the punishment has resulted in clear injustice. Also, the power to set aside an executed punishment should ordinarily be exercised only within a reasonable time after the punishmenthas been executed. In this connection, 4 months is a reasonable time in theabsence of unusual circumstances.AppealsIn general.Any servicemember punished under Article 15 who considers the punishmentto be unjust or disproportionate to the offense may appeal through the properchannels to the next superior authority.Who may act on appeal.A "superior authority," as prescribed by the Secretary concerned, may act on an appeal. When punishment has been imposed underdelegation of a commander's authority to administer nonjudicial punishment (_see_ paragraph 2c of this Part), the appeal may not bedirected to the commander who delegated the authority.Format of appeal.Appeals shall be in writing and may include the appellant's reasons for regarding the punishment as unjust or disproportionate.Time limit.An appeal shall be submitted within 5 days of imposition of punishment,or the right to appeal shall be waived in the absence of good cause shown.A servicemember who has appealed may be required to undergo any punishmentimposed while the appeal is pending, except that if action is not taken onthe appeal within 5 days after the appeal was submitted, and if the servicememberso requests, any unexecuted punishment involving restraint or extra dutyshall be stayed until action on the appeal is taken.Legal review.Before acting on an appeal from any punishment of the kind set forth in Article 15(e)(1)-(7), the authority who is to act on the appeal shallrefer the case to a judge advocate or to a lawyer of the Department of Homeland Security for consideration and advice, and may so refer the case upon appeal fromany punishment imposed under Article 15. When the case is referred, the judge advocate or lawyer is not limited to an examination of any written matter comprising the record of proceedings and may make any inquiries and examineany additional matter deemed necessary.Action by superior authority.In general.In acting on an appeal, the superior authority may exercise thesame power with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised underArticle 15(d) and paragraph 6 of this Part by the officer who imposed thepunishment. The superior authority may take such action even if no appealhas been filed.Matters considered.When reviewing the action of an officer who imposed nonjudicial punishment, the superior authority may consider the record of the proceedings, any matters submitted by the servicemember, any matters considered duringthe legal review, if any, and any other appropriate matters.Additional proceedings.If the superior authority sets aside a nonjudicial punishment dueto a procedural error, that authority may authorize additional proceedingsunder Article 15, to be conducted by the officer who imposed the nonjudicial punishment, the commander, or a successor in command, for the same offenses involved in the original proceedings. Any punishment imposed as a resultof these additional proceedings may be no more severe than that originally imposed.Notification.Upon completion of action by the superior authority, the servicememberupon whom punishment was imposed shall be promptly notified of the result.Delegation to principal assistant.If authorized by regulation of the Secretary concerned a superior authority who is a commander exercising general court-martial jurisdiction,or is an officer of general or flag rank in command, may delegate the powerunder Article 15(e) and this paragraph to a principal assistant.Records of nonjudicial punishmentThe content, format, use, and disposition of records of nonjudicial punishment may be prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned.
