# NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT PROCEDURE

## 1. General

### a. Authority.

Nonjudicial punishment in the United States Armed Forces is authorized

by Article 15.

### b. Nature.

Nonjudicial punishment is a disciplinary measure more serious than

 the administrative corrective measures discussed in paragraph 1g, but less

 serious than trial by court-martial.

### c. Purpose.

Nonjudicial punishment provides commanders with an essential and

 prompt means of maintaining good order and discipline and also promotes

positive behavior changes in servicemembers without the stigma of a court-martial

conviction.

### d. Policy.

#### (1) Commander's responsibility.

Commanders are responsible for good order and discipline in their

 commands. Generally, discipline can be maintained through effective leadership

 including, when necessary, administrative corrective measures. Nonjudicial

 punishment is ordinarily appropriate when administrative corrective measures

 are inadequate due to the nature of the minor offense or the record of the

 servicemember, unless it is clear that only trial by court-martial will meet

 the needs of justice and discipline. Nonjudicial punishment shall be considered

 on an individual basis. Commanders considering nonjudicial punishment should

 consider the nature of the offense, the record of the servicemember, the

needs for good order and discipline, and the effect of nonjudicial punishment

on the servicemember and the servicemember's record.

#### (2) Commander's discretion.

A commander who is considering a case for disposition under Article

 15 will exercise personal discretion in evaluating each case, both as to

 whether nonjudicial punishment is appropriate, and, if so, as to the nature

and amount of punishment appropriate. No superior may direct that a subordinate

 authority impose nonjudicial punishment in a particular case, issue regulations,

orders, or "guides" which suggest to subordinate authorities

that certain categories of minor offenses be disposed of by nonjudicial punishment

instead of by court-martial or administrative corrective measures, or that

predetermined kinds or amounts of punishments be imposed for certain classifications

of offenses that the subordinate considers appropriate for disposition by

nonjudicial punishment.

#### (3) Commander's suspension authority.

Commanders should consider suspending all or part of any punishment

 selected under Article 15, particularly in the case of first offenders or

when significant extenuating or mitigating matters are present. Suspension

provides an incentive to the offender and gives an opportunity to the commander

to evaluate the offender during the period of suspension.

### e. Minor offenses.

Nonjudicial punishment may be imposed for acts or omissions that

are minor offenses under the punitive articles (_see_ Part

IV). Whether an offense is minor depends on several factors: the nature of

the offense and the circumstances surrounding its commission; the offender's

age, rank, duty assignment, record and experience; and the maximum sentence

 imposable for the offense if tried by general court-martial. Ordinarily,

a minor offense is an offense which the maximum sentence imposable would

not include a dishonorable discharge or confinement for longer than 1 year

if tried by general court-martial. The decision whether an offense is "minor"

is a matter of discretion for the commander imposing nonjudicial punishment,

but nonjudicial punishment for an offense other than a minor offense (even

though thought by the commander to be minor) is not a bar to trial by court-martial

for the same offense. _See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(D)(iv). However,

the accused may show at trial that nonjudicial punishment was imposed, and

if the accused does so, this fact must be considered in determining an appropriate

sentence. _See_ Article 15(f); R.C.M. 1001(c)(1)(B).

### f. Limitations on nonjudicial punishment.

#### (1) Double punishment prohibited.

When nonjudicial punishment has been imposed for an offense, punishment

may not again be imposed for the same offense under Article 15._ But

see_ paragraph 1e concerning trial by court-martial.

#### (2) Increase in punishment prohibited.

 Once nonjudicial punishment has been imposed, it may not be increased,

upon appeal or otherwise.

#### (3) Multiple punishment prohibited.

When a commander determines that nonjudicial punishment is appropriate

for a particular servicemember, all known offenses determined to be appropriate

for disposition by nonjudicial punishment and ready to be considered at that

time, including all such offenses arising from a single incident or course

of conduct, shall ordinarily be considered together, and not made the basis

for multiple punishments.

#### (4) Statute of limitations.

Except as provided in Article 43(d), nonjudicial punishment may

not be imposed for offenses which were committed more than 2 years before

the date of imposition._ See_ Article 43(c).

#### (5) Civilian courts.

Nonjudicial punishment may not be imposed for an offense tried by

a court which derives its authority from the United States. Nonjudicial

punishment may not be imposed for an offense tried by a State or foreign court

 unless authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned.

### g. Relationship of nonjudicial punishment to administrative corrective

 measures.

Article 15 and Part V of this Manual do not apply to include, or

 limit use of administrative corrective measures that promote efficiency and

 good order and discipline such as counseling, admonitions, reprimands, exhortations,

disapprovals, criticisms, censures, reproofs, rebukes, extra military instruction,

and administrative withholding of privileges._ See also_ R.C.M.

306. Administrative corrective measures are not punishment, and they may

be used for acts or omissions which are not offenses under the code and for

acts or omissions which are offenses under the code.

### h. Applicable standards.

Unless otherwise provided, the service regulations and procedures of the service member shall apply.

### i. Effect of errors.

Failure to comply with any of the procedural provisions of Part

V of this Manual shall not invalidate a punishment imposed under Article

15, unless the error materially prejudiced a substantial right of the servicemember

on whom the punishment was imposed.

## 2. Who may impose nonjudicial punishment

The following persons may serve as a nonjudicial punishment authority

 for the purposes of administering nonjudicial punishment proceedings under

this Part:

### a. Commander.

As provided by regulations of the Secretary concerned,

 a commander may impose nonjudicial punishment upon any military personnel

of that command. "Commander" means a commissioned or warrant officer

 who, by virtue of rank and assignment, exercises primary command authority

over a military organization or prescribed territorial area, which under

pertinent official directives is recognized as a "command." "Commander" includes a commander of a joint command. Subject

to subparagraph 1d(2) and any regulations of the Secretary concerned, the

 authority of a commander to impose nonjudicial punishment as to certain types

 of offenses, certain categories of persons, or in specific cases, or to impose

 certain types of punishment, may be limited or withheld by a superior commander

 or by the Secretary concerned.

### b. Officer in charge.

If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, an officer

 in charge may impose nonjudicial punishment upon enlisted persons assigned

to that unit.

### c. Principal assistant.

If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a commander

 exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general or

flag rank in command may delegate that commander's powers under Article 15

to a principal assistant. The Secretary concerned may define "principal

 assistant."

## 3. Right to demand trial

Except in the case of a person attached to or embarked in a vessel,

 punishment may not be imposed under Article 15 upon any member of the armed

 forces who has, before the imposition of nonjudicial punishment, demanded

trial by court-martial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment. This right may

also be granted to a person attached to or embarked in a vessel if so authorized

by regulations of the Secretary concerned. A person is "attached to"

 or "embarked in" a vessel if, at the time nonjudicial punishment

is imposed, that person is assigned or attached to the vessel, is on board

for passage, or is assigned or attached to an embarked staff, unit, detachment,

 squadron, team, air group, or other regularly organized body.

## 4. Procedure

### a. Notice.

If, after a preliminary inquiry (_see_ R.C.M. 303),

 the nonjudicial punishment authority determines that disposition by nonjudicial

 punishment proceedings is appropriate (_see_ R.C.M. 306:

paragraph 1 of this Part), the nonjudicial punishment authority shall cause

the servicemember to be notified. The notice shall include:

(1) a statement that the nonjudicial punishment authority is considering

 the imposition of nonjudicial punishment;

(2) a statement describing the alleged offenses-including the

 article of the code-which the member is alleged to have committed;

(3) a brief summary of the information upon which the allegations are

 based or a statement that the member may, upon request, examine available

 statements and evidence;

(4) a statement of the rights that will be accorded to the servicemember

 under paragraphs 4c(1) and (2) of this Part;

(5) unless the right to demand trial is not applicable (_see

_ paragraph 3 of this Part), a statement that the member may demand

 trial by court-martial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment, a statement of

the maximum punishment which the nonjudicial punishment authority may impose

by nonjudicial punishment; a statement that, if trial by court-martial is

 demanded, charges could be referred for trial by summary, special, or general

 court-martial; that the member may not be tried by summary court-martial

over the member's objection; and that at a special or general court-martial

the member has the right to be represented by counsel.

### b. Decision by servicemember.

#### (1) Demand for trial by court-martial.

If the servicemember demands trial by court-martial (when this right

 is applicable), the nonjudicial proceedings shall be terminated. It is within

 the discretion of the commander whether to forward or refer charges for trial

 by court-martial (_see_ R.C.M. 306; 307; 401-407) in

such a case, but in no event may nonjudicial punishment be imposed for the

offenses affected unless the demand is voluntarily withdrawn.

#### (2) No demand for trial by court-martial.

If the servicemember does not demand trial by court-martial within

a reasonable time after notice under paragraph 4a of this Part, or if the

right to demand trial by court-martial is not applicable, the nonjudicial

punishment authority may proceed under paragraph 4c of this Part.

### c. Nonjudicial punishment accepted.

#### (1) Personal appearance requested; procedure.

Before nonjudicial punishment may be imposed, the servicemember

 shall be entitled to appear personally before the nonjudicial punishment

 authority who offered nonjudicial punishment, except when appearance is

prevented by the unavailability of the nonjudicial punishment authority or

by extraordinary circumstances, in which case the servicemember shall be

entitled to appear before a person designated by the nonjudicial punishment

authority who shall prepare a written summary of any proceedings before that

person and forward it and any written matter submitted by the servicemember

to the nonjudicial punishment authority. If the servicemember requests personal

 appearance, the servicemember shall be entitled to:

(A) Be informed in accordance with Article 31(b);

(B) Be accompanied by a spokesperson provided or arranged for by the

 member unless the punishment to be imposed will not exceed extra duty for

14 days, restriction for 14 days, and an oral reprimand. Such a spokesperson

need not be qualified under R.C.M. 502(d); such spokesperson is not entitled

to travel or similar expenses, and the proceedings need not be delayed to

permit the presence of a spokesperson; the spokesperson may speak for the

 servicemember, but may not question witnesses except as the nonjudicial

punishment authority may allow as a matter of discretion;

(C) Be informed orally or in writing of the information against the

 servicemember and relating to the offenses alleged;

(D) Be allowed to examine documents or physical objects against the

 member which the nonjudicial punishment authority has examined in connection

 with the case and on which the nonjudicial punishment authority intends to

rely in deciding whether and how much nonjudicial punishment to impose;

(E) Present matters in defense, extenuation, and mitigation orally,

or in writing, or both;

(F) Have present witnesses, including those adverse to the servicemember,

 upon request if their statements will be relevant and they are reasonably

 available. For purposes of this subparagraph, a witness is not reasonably

 available if the witness requires reimbursement by the United States for

any cost incurred in appearing, cannot appear without unduly delaying the

 proceedings, or, if a military witness, cannot be excused from other important

 duties;

(G) Have the proceeding open to the public unless the nonjudicial punishment

authority determines that the proceeding should be closed for good cause,

such as military exigencies or security interests, or unless the punishment

to be imposed will not exceed extra duty for 14 days, restriction for 14

days, and an oral reprimand; however, nothing in this subparagraph requires

special arrangements to be made to facilitate access to the proceeding.

#### (2) Personal appearance waived; procedure.

Subject to the approval of the nonjudicial punishment authority,

the servicemember may request not to appear personally under paragraph

4c(1) of this Part. If such request is granted, the servicemember may submit

written matters for consideration by the nonjudicial punishment authority

before such authority's decision under paragraph 4c(4) of this Part. The

servicemember shall be informed of the right to remain silent and that matters

submitted may be used against the member in a trial by court-martial.

#### (3) Evidence.

The Military Rules of Evidence (Part III), other than with respect

to privileges, do not apply at nonjudicial punishment proceedings. Any relevant

 matter may be considered, after compliance with paragraphs 4c(1)(C) and

(D) of this Part.

#### (4) Decision.

After considering all relevant matters presented, if the nonjudicial

 punishment authority-

(A) Does not conclude that the servicemember committed the offenses

 alleged, the nonjudicial punishment authority shall so inform the member

and terminate the proceedings;

(B) Concludes that the servicemember committed one or more of the offenses

alleged, the nonjudicial punishment authority shall:

(i) so inform the servicemember;

(ii) inform the servicemember of the punishment imposed; and

(iii) inform the servicemember of the right to appeal (_see_

paragraph 7 of this Part).

### d. Nonjudicial punishment based on record of court of inquiry or other

 investigative body.

Nonjudicial punishment may be based on the record of a court of

 inquiry or other investigative body, in which proceeding the member was

accorded the rights of a party. No additional proceeding under paragraph

 4c(1) of this Part is required. The servicemember shall be informed in writing

 that nonjudicial punishment is being considered based on the record of the

 proceedings in question, and given the opportunity, if applicable, to refuse

 nonjudicial punishment. If the servicemember does not demand trial by court-martial

or has no option, the servicemember may submit, in writing, any matter in

defense, extenuation, or mitigation, to the officer considering imposing

nonjudicial punishment, for consideration by that officer to determine whether

the member committed the offenses in question, and, if so, to determine an

appropriate punishment.

## 5. Punishments

### a. General limitations.

The Secretary concerned may limit the power granted by Article 15

 with respect to the kind and amount of the punishment authorized. Subject

to paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Part and to regulations of the Secretary concerned,

 the kinds and amounts of punishment authorized by Article 15(b) may be imposed

 upon servicemembers as provided in this paragraph.

### b. Authorized maximum punishments.

In addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, the following

 disciplinary punishments subject to the limitation of paragraph 5d of this

 Part, may be imposed upon servicemembers:

#### (1) Upon commissioned officers and warrant officers-

(A) By any commanding officer-restriction to specified limits,

with or without suspension from duty for not more than 30 consecutive days;

(B) If imposed by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction,

an officer of general or flag rank in command, or a principal assistant as

defined in paragraph 2c of this Part-

(i) arrest in quarters for not more than 30 consecutive days;

(ii) forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month's pay per month

for 2 months;

(iii) restriction to specified limits, with or without suspension from

 duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days;

#### (2) Upon other military personnel of the command-

(A) By any nonjudicial punishment authority-

(i) if imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, confinement

on bread and water or diminished rations for not more than 3 consecutive

days;

(ii) correctional custody for not more than 7 consecutive days;

(iii) forfeiture of not more than 7 days' pay;

(iv) reduction to the next inferior grade, if the grade from which demoted

 is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or

any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction;

(v) extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than

14 consecutive days;

(vi) restriction to specified limits, with or without suspension from

 duty, for not more than 14 consecutive days;

(B) If imposed by a commanding officer of the grade of major or lieutenant

commander or above or a principal assistant as defined in paragraph 2c of

this Part-

(i) if imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, confinement

on bread and water or diminished rations for not more than 3 consecutive

days;

(ii) correctional custody for not more than 30 consecutive days;

(iii) forfeiture of not more than one-half of 1 month's pay per month

for 2 months;

(iv) reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade

 from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing

 the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction,

 but enlisted members in pay grades above E-4 may not be reduced more than

one pay grade, except that during time of war or national emergency this

category of persons may be reduced two grades if the Secretary concerned

determines that circumstances require the removal of this limitation;

(v) extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than

45 consecutive days;

(vi) restriction to specified limits, with or without suspension from

 duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days.

### c. Nature of punishment.

#### (1) Admonition and reprimand.

Admonition and reprimand are two forms of censure intended to express

 adverse reflection upon or criticism of a person's conduct. A reprimand is

a more severe form of censure than an admonition. When imposed as nonjudicial

 punishment, the admonition or reprimand is considered to be punitive, unlike

 the nonpunitive admonition and reprimand provided for in paragraph 1g of

this Part. In the case of commissioned officers and warrant officers, admonitions

 and reprimands given as nonjudicial punishment must be administered in writing.

 In other cases, unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned, they

 may be administered either orally or in writing.

#### (2) Restriction.

Restriction is the least severe form of deprivation of liberty.

 Restriction involves moral rather than physical restraint. The severity of

this type of restraint depends on its duration and the geographical limits

specified when the punishment is imposed. A person undergoing restriction

may be required to report to a designated place at specified times if reasonably

necessary to ensure that the punishment is being properly executed. Unless

otherwise specified by the nonjudicial punishment authority, a person in

restriction may be required to perform any military duty.

#### (3) Arrest in quarters.

As in the case of restriction, the restraint involved in arrest

in quarters is enforced by a moral obligation rather than by physical means.

This punishment may be imposed only on officers. An officer undergoing this

 punishment may be required to perform those duties prescribed by the Secretary

 concerned. However, an officer so punished is required to remain within that

 officer's quarters during the period of punishment unless the limits of arrest

 are otherwise extended by appropriate authority. The quarters of an officer

may consist of a military residence, whether a tent, stateroom, or other

quarters assigned, or a private residence when government quarters have not

been provided.

#### (4) Correctional custody.

Correctional custody is the physical restraint of a person during

 duty or nonduty hours, or both, imposed as a punishment under Article 15,

and may include extra duties, fatigue duties, or hard labor as an incident

of correctional custody. A person may be required to serve correctional custody

in a confinement facility, but if practicable, not in immediate association

with persons awaiting trial or held in confinement pursuant to trial by

court-martial. A person undergoing correctional custody may be required to

 perform those regular military duties, extra duties, fatigue duties, and

hard labor which may be assigned by the authority charged with the administration

of the punishment. The conditions under which correctional custody is served

shall be prescribed by the Secretary concerned. In addition, the Secretary

concerned may limit the categories of enlisted members upon whom correctional

custody may be imposed. The authority competent to order the release of a

person from orrectional custody shall be as designated by the Secretary

concerned.

#### (5) Confinement on bread and water or diminished rations.

Confinement on bread and water or diminished rations involves confinement

in places where the person so confined may communicate only with authorized

personnel. The ration to be furnished a person undergoing a punishment of

confinement on bread and water or diminished rations is that specified by

the authority charged with the administration of the punishment, but the

ration may not consist solely of bread and water unless this punishment has

been specifically imposed. When punishment of confinement on bread and water

or diminished rations is imposed, a signed certificate of a medical officer

containing an opinion that no serious injury to the health of the person

to be confined will be caused by that punishment, must be obtained before

the punishment is executed. The categories of enlisted personnel upon whom

this type of punishment may be imposed may be limited by the Secretary concerned.

#### (6) Extra duties.

Extra duties involve the performance of duties in addition to those

 normally assigned to the person undergoing the punishment. Extra duties may

 include fatigue duties. Military duties of any kind may be assigned as extra

 duty. However, no extra duty may be imposed which constitutes a known safety

or health hazard to the member or which constitutes cruel or unusual punishment

or which is not sanctioned by customs of the service concerned. Extra duties

 assigned as punishment of noncommissioned officers, petty officers, or any

 other enlisted persons of equivalent grades or positions designated by the

 Secretary concerned, should not be of a kind which demeans their grades or

 positions.

#### (7) Reduction in grade.

Reduction in grade is one of the most severe forms of nonjudicial

 punishment and it should be used with discretion. As used in Article 15,

the phrase "if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion

authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate

to the one who imposes the reduction" does not refer to the authority

to promote the person concerned but to the general authority to promote to

the grade held by the person to be punished.

#### (8) Forfeiture of pay.

Forfeiture means a permanent loss of entitlement to the pay forfeited.

"Pay," as used with respect to forfeiture of pay under Article

15, refers to the basic pay of the person or, in the case of reserve component

personnel on inactive-duty, compensation for periods of inactive-duty training,

plus any sea or hardship duty pay. "Basic pay" includes no element

of pay other than the basic pay fixed by statute for the grade and length

of service of the person concerned and does not include special pay for a

special qualification, incentive pay for the performance of hazardous duties,

 proficiency pay, subsistence and quarters allowances, and similar types of

 compensation. If the punishment includes both reduction, whether or not

suspended, and forfeiture of pay, the forfeiture must be based on the grade

to which reduced. The amount to be forfeited will be expressed in whole dollar

 amounts only and not in a number of day's pay or fractions of monthly pay.

If the forfeiture is to be applied for more than 1 month, the amount to be

 forfeited per month and the number of months should be stated. Forfeiture

of pay may not extend to any pay accrued before the date of its imposition.

### d. Limitations on combination of punishments.

(1) Arrest in quarters may not be imposed in combination with restriction;

(2) Confinement on bread and water or diminished rations may not be

 imposed in combination with correctional custody, extra duties, or restriction;

(3) Correctional custody may not be imposed in combination with restriction

or extra duties;

(4) Restriction and extra duties may be combined to run concurrently,

but the combination may not exceed the maximum imposable for extra duties;

(5) Subject to the limits in subparagraphs d(1) through (4) all authorized

punishments may be imposed in a single case in the maximum amounts.

### e. Punishments imposed on reserve component personnel while on inactive-duty

training.

When a punishment under Article 15 amounting to a deprivation of

 liberty (for example, restriction, correctional custody, extra duties, or

 arrest in quarters) is imposed on a member of a reserve component during

a period of inactive-duty training, the punishment may be served during one

or both of the following:

(1) a normal period of inactive-duty training; or

(2) a subsequent period of active duty (not including a period of active

 duty under Article 2(d)(1), unless such active duty was approved by the

Secretary concerned).

Unserved punishments may be carried over to subsequent

periods of inactive-duty training or active duty. A sentence to forfeiture

of pay may be collected from active duty and inactive-duty training pay during

subsequent periods of duty.

### f. Punishments imposed on reserve component personnel when ordered to

 active duty for disciplinary purposes.

When a punishment under Article 15 is imposed on a member of a

reserve component during a period of active duty to which the reservist was

 ordered pursuant to R.C.M. 204 and which constitutes a deprivation of liberty

 (for example, restriction, correctional custody, extra duties, or arrest

in quarters), the punishment may be served during any or all of the following:

(1) that period of active duty to which the reservist was ordered pursuant

to Article 2(d), but only where the order to active duty was approved by

the Secretary concerned;

(2) a subsequent normal period of inactive-duty training; or

(3) a subsequent period of active duty (not including a period of active

 duty pursuant to R.C.M. 204 which was not approved by the Secretary concerned).

Unserved

punishments may be carried over to subsequent periods of inactive-duty training

or active duty. A sentence to forfeiture of pay may be collected from active

duty and inactive-duty training pay during subsequent periods of duty.

### g. Effective date and execution of punishments.

Reduction and forfeiture of pay, if unsuspended, take effect on

the date the commander imposes the punishments. Other punishments, if unsuspended,

 will take effect and be carried into execution as prescribed by the Secretary

 concerned.

## 6. Suspension, mitigation, remission, and setting aside

### a. Suspension.

The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposes nonjudicial punishment,

the commander who imposes nonjudicial punishment, or a successor in command

over the person punished, may, at any time, suspend any part or amount of

the unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend a reduction in grade or

a forfeiture, whether or not executed, subject to the following rules:

(1) An executed punishment of reduction or forfeiture of pay may be

 suspended only within a period of 4 months after the date of execution.

(2) Suspension of a punishment may not be for a period longer than 6

 months from the date of the suspension, and the expiration of the current

 enlistment or term of service of the servicemember involved automatically

 terminates the period of suspension.

(3) Unless the suspension is sooner vacated, suspended portions of the

 punishment are remitted, without further action, upon the termination of

the period of suspension.

(4) Unless otherwise stated, an action suspending a punishment includes

a condition that the servicemember not violate any punitive article of the

code. The nonjudicial punishment authority may specify in writing additional

 conditions of the suspension.

(5) A suspension may be vacated by any nonjudicial punishment authority

 or commander competent to impose upon the servicemember concerned punishment

of the kind and amount involved in the vacation of suspension. Vacation of

 suspension may be based only on a violation of the conditions of suspension

 which occurs within the period of suspension. Before a suspension may be

 vacated, the servicemember ordinarily shall be notified and given an opportunity

to respond. Although a hearing is not required to vacate a suspension, if

the punishment is of the kind set forth in Article 15(e)(1)-(7), the servicemember

should, unless impracticable, be given an opportunity to appear before the

officer authorized to vacate suspension of the punishment to present any

matters in defense, extenuation, or mitigation of the violation on which

the vacation action is to be based. Vacation of a suspended nonjudicial punishment

is not itself nonjudicial punishment, and additional action to impose nonjudicial

punishment for a violation of a punitive article of the code upon which the

vacation action is based is not precluded thereby.

### b. Mitigation.

Mitigation is a reduction in either the quantity or quality of a

 punishment, its general nature remaining the same. Mitigation is appropriate

 when the offender's later good conduct merits a reduction in the punishment,

or when it is determined that the punishment imposed was disproportionate.

The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposes nonjudicial punishment,

the commander who imposes nonjudicial punishment, or a successor in command

may, at any time, mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of

the punishment imposed. The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposes

 nonjudicial punishment, the commander who imposes nonjudicial punishment,

or a successor in command may also mitigate reduction in grade, whether executed

or unexecuted, to forfeiture of pay, but the amount of the forfeiture may

not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed by the officer

who initially imposed the nonjudicial punishment. Reduction in grade may

be mitigated to forfeiture of pay only within 4 months after the date of

 execution. 

 When mitigating-

(1) Arrest in quarters to restriction;

(2) Confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to correctional

 custody;

(3) Correctional custody or confinement on bread and water or diminished

 rations to extra duties or restriction, or both; or

(4) Extra duties to restriction, the mitigated punishment may not be

for a greater period than the punishment mitigated. As restriction is the

least severe form of deprivation of liberty, it may not be mitigated to a

lesser period of another form of deprivation of liberty, as that would mean

an increase in the quality of the punishment.

### c. Remission.

Remission is an action whereby any portion of the unexecuted punishment

is cancelled. Remission is appropriate under the same circumstances as mitigation.

The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposes punishment, the commander

who imposes nonjudicial punishment, or a successor in command may, at any

time, remit any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the punishment

 imposed. The expiration of the current enlistment or term of service of the

 servicemember automatically remits any unexecuted punishment imposed under

 Article 15.

### d. Setting aside.

Setting aside is an action whereby the punishment or any part or

 amount thereof, whether executed or unexecuted, is set aside and any property,

 privileges, or rights affected by the portion of the punishment set aside

are restored. The nonjudicial punishment authority who imposed punishment,

the commander who imposes nonjudicial punishment, or a successor in command

may set aside punishment. The power to set aside punishments and restore

rights, privileges, and property affected by the executed portion of a punishment

 should ordinarily be exercised only when the authority considering the case

 believes that, under all circumstances of the case, the punishment has resulted

 in clear injustice. Also, the power to set aside an executed punishment should

 ordinarily be exercised only within a reasonable time after the punishment

has been executed. In this connection, 4 months is a reasonable time in the

absence of unusual circumstances.

## 7. Appeals

### a. In general.

Any servicemember punished under Article 15 who considers the punishment

to be unjust or disproportionate to the offense may appeal through the proper

channels to the next superior authority.

### b. Who may act on appeal.

A "superior authority," as prescribed by the Secretary

 concerned, may act on an appeal. When punishment has been imposed under

delegation of a commander's authority to administer nonjudicial punishment

 (_see_ paragraph 2c of this Part), the appeal may not be

directed to the commander who delegated the authority.

### c. Format of appeal.

Appeals shall be in writing and may include the appellant's reasons

 for regarding the punishment as unjust or disproportionate.

### d. Time limit.

An appeal shall be submitted within 5 days of imposition of punishment,

or the right to appeal shall be waived in the absence of good cause shown.

A servicemember who has appealed may be required to undergo any punishment

imposed while the appeal is pending, except that if action is not taken on

the appeal within 5 days after the appeal was submitted, and if the servicemember

so requests, any unexecuted punishment involving restraint or extra duty

shall be stayed until action on the appeal is taken.

### e. Legal review.

Before acting on an appeal from any punishment of the kind set forth

 in Article 15(e)(1)-(7), the authority who is to act on the appeal shall

refer the case to a judge advocate or to a lawyer of the Department of Homeland Security

 for consideration and advice, and may so refer the case upon appeal from

any punishment imposed under Article 15. When the case is referred, the judge

 advocate or lawyer is not limited to an examination of any written matter

 comprising the record of proceedings and may make any inquiries and examine

### f. Action by superior authority.

#### (1) In general.

In acting on an appeal, the superior authority may exercise the

same power with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under

Article 15(d) and paragraph 6 of this Part by the officer who imposed the

punishment. The superior authority may take such action even if no appeal

has been filed.

#### (2) Matters considered.

When reviewing the action of an officer who imposed nonjudicial

 punishment, the superior authority may consider the record of the proceedings,

 any matters submitted by the servicemember, any matters considered during

the legal review, if any, and any other appropriate matters.

#### (3) Additional proceedings.

If the superior authority sets aside a nonjudicial punishment due

to a procedural error, that authority may authorize additional proceedings

under Article 15, to be conducted by the officer who imposed the nonjudicial

 punishment, the commander, or a successor in command, for the same offenses

 involved in the original proceedings. Any punishment imposed as a result

of these additional proceedings may be no more severe than that originally

 imposed.

#### (4) Notification.

Upon completion of action by the superior authority, the servicemember

upon whom punishment was imposed shall be promptly notified of the result.

#### (5) Delegation to principal assistant.

If authorized by regulation of the Secretary concerned a superior

 authority who is a commander exercising general court-martial jurisdiction,

or is an officer of general or flag rank in command, may delegate the power

under Article 15(e) and this paragraph to a principal assistant.

## 8. Records of nonjudicial punishment

The content, format, use, and disposition of records of nonjudicial

 punishment may be prescribed by regulations of the Secretary concerned.
